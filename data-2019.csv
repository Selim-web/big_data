Primarily because the entity that controls Bitcoin, its community of users, does not take actions to stabilize and secure the cryptocurrency that is, in the manner that nations' monetary policies can stabilize and secure national currencies - the author evaluates Bitcoin as untrustworthy. The author then offer an argument that its untrustworthiness undermines Bitcoin's ability to serve both as medium of exchange and as store of value. Bitcoin's untrustworthiness does not, however, undermine its usefulness as a speculative investment. Finally, the author discuss the extent to which - and how - other cryptocurrencies can avoid the evaluation that they are untrustworthy.","[Scharding, Tobey] Rutgers Business Sch, Newark, NJ 08854 USA","Rutgers State University Newark; Rutgers State University New Brunswick","Scharding, T (corresponding author), Rutgers Business Sch, Newark, NJ 08854 USA.","","","","","","","","20","2","2","0","5","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND","1569-3767","","978-1-78973-381-5; 978-1-78973-382-2","INT FINANC REV","","","2019","20","","","","","","151","165","","10.1108/S1569-376720190000020017","http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/S1569-376720190000020017","","","15","Business; Business, Finance","Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH)","Business & Economics","BP0WS","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000537615900010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This can be done by using different techniques, and for different purposes. For instance, a growing number of protocols embed metadata in the blockchain to certify and transfer the ownership of a variety of assets beyond cryptocurrency. A point of debate in the Bitcoin community is whether metadata negatively impact on the effectiveness of Bitcoin with respect to its primary function. This paper is a systematic analysis of the usage of Bitcoin metadata over the years. We discuss all the known techniques to embed metadata in the Bitcoin blockchain; we then extract metadata, and analyse them from different angles.","[Bartoletti, Massimo; Pompianu, Livio] Univ Cagliari, Dipartimento Matemat & Informat, Via Osped 72, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy; [Bellomy, Bryn] ConsenSys, 49 Bogart St, Brooklyn, NY 11206 USA","University of Cagliari","Bartoletti, M (corresponding author), Univ Cagliari, Dipartimento Matemat & Informat, Via Osped 72, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy.","bart@unica.it; bryn.bellomy@consensys.net; livio.pompianu@unica.it","","Pompianu, Livio/0000-0003-3745-4324","Aut.

In order to clarify the controversy surrounding the phenomenon of Bitcoin and its popularity, the author tries to reveal its main essence and to answer the question whether Bitcoin is a new form of a financial pyramid. For this, the essence of the financial pyramid, its types, the principle of work from an economic and legal point of view are considered. The author comes to the conclusion that, despite the fact that Bitcoin has a number of signs of a financial pyramid, it is not, although it has a number of drawbacks-limited walking, lack of legal framework, insecurity, and others. Bitcoin has bright signs of a financial bubble; at a sufficiently high cost of the transaction, bitcoin mining is little profitable. In the opinion of the author, Bitcoin currently has two main ways: recognition as a world currency or definition as a financial pyramid. But due to its shortcomings, Bitcoin, as a world currency, is imperfect and currently has more characteristics and signs of the financial pyramid phenomenon.","[Lapteva, Elena V.; Ostroumov, Vladimir V.; Skvortsova, Elena M.] Govt Russian Federat, Financial Univ, Moscow, Russia","Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation","Ostroumov, VV (corresponding author), Govt Russian Federat, Financial Univ, Moscow, Russia.","ella-7@yandex.ru; Ostroumov.v@mail.ru; skvortsova-57@bk.ru","","Lapteva, Elena/0000-0003-1571-5810","","","","","12","0","0","0","1","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","1860-949X","1860-9503","978-3-030-13397-9; 978-3-030-13396-2","STUD COMPUT INTELL","","","2019","826","","","","","","617","624","","10.1007/978-3-030-13397-9_67","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-13397-9_67","10.1007/978-3-030-13397-9","","8","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Information Science & Library Science; Law","Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)","Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science; Government & Law","BN7KN","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000487332600068","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Dollars are supplied by a central bank to achieve its inflation target, while the Bitcoin supply grows deterministically. Our fundamental pricing equation implies in its simplest form that Bitcoin prices form a martingale. Mutual impatience implies absence of speculation. Price volatility therefore does not invalidate the medium-of-exchange function. Bitcoin block rewards are not a tax on Bitcoin holders: they are financed with a Dollar tax.

We find that Bitcoin is an effective strong hedge for all these indices under monthly data frequency. However, daily and weekly returns do not demonstrate strong hedge properties.

We find evidence of a smooth intra-daily seasonality pattern, and an abnormal trade- and volatility intensity at Thursdays and Fridays. We find no predictability for Bitcoin returns at or above one day, though, we find predictability for sample frequencies up to 6 h. Predictability of Bitcoin returns is also found to be time-varying. We also study the behaviour of the realized volatility of Bitcoin. We document a remarkable high percentage of jumps above 80%. We also find that realized volatility exhibits: (i) long memory; (ii) leverage effect; and (iii) no impact from lagged jumps.

This calls for the development of novel methods capable of characterizing different entities in the Bitcoin network. In this paper, a method to attack Bitcoin anonymity is presented, leveraging a novel cascading machine learning approach that requires only a few features directly extracted from Bitcoin blockchain data. Cascading, used to enrich entities information with data from previous classifications, led to considerably improved multi-class classification performance with excellent values of Precision close to 1.0 for each considered class. Final models were implemented and compared using different machine learning models and showed significantly higher accuracy compared to their baseline implementation.

The extension is based on network models, which improve over pure autoregressive models, as they introduce a contemporaneous contagion component, that describes contagion effects between prices. Our empirical findings show that the proposed model is able to well describe the correlation structure between bitcoin prices in different exchange markets, which appear rather strong, whereas the correlation of bitcoin prices with traditional assets is low.

We employ statistical techniques to empirically evaluate such claim. A branch of literature links the existence of a bubble in some financial asset's price to strict local martingales - a finitely lived asset has a bubble if, and only if, it is a strict local martingale under the equivalent risk-neutral measure. A diffusion process is a strict local martingale if its volatility increases faster than linearly as its level grows. We apply a nonparametric method to estimate the volatility function of Bitcoin daily and high frequency prices, as well as of more traditional financial assets. We then estimate the stochastic volatility model of Andersen and Piterbarg (2007), whose parameter space has a specific subset under which the asset's price is a strict local martingale. Results suggest the existence of a bubble in Bitcoin prices from early 2013 to mid 2014, but, interestingly, not in late 2017. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Finally, the shuffled output address of the user who quits the service is modified to its destination address. Security analysis shows that the scheme satisfies the anonymity of the user who quits the service based on the double discrete logarithm problem and the strong RSA assumption, and can be implemented without modifying the current bitcoin system.

"J","Ram, AJ","","","","Ram, Asheer Jaywant","","","Bitcoin as a new asset class","MEDITARI ACCOUNTANCY RESEARCH","","","English","Article","","","","","","Finance; Portfolio diversification; Bitcoin; Sharpe ratio; Cryptocurrency; Asset class","","Purpose Bitcoin is the best-known cryptocurrency which currently holds the largest market capitalisation and is regarded as a standard example of a cryptocurrency. There is, however, no consensus as to the nature of the Bitcoin. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether Bitcoin represents a new asset class by building on prior research. Design/methodology/approach The prior literature on asset classes is explored in detail and then applied to the Bitcoin. Four key criteria of asset classes are discussed, namely, investability, politico-economic profile, correlation of returns and risk-reward profile. Statistical techniques are used to inform the conclusions for the third and fourth criteria. Findings This research finds that the Bitcoin represents a distinct alternative investment and asset class. There are significant opportunities for investment. The politico-economic profile of the decentralised and consensus-based Bitcoin is dissimilar to other asset classes. The Bitcoin shares little or no correlation with other asset classes. Using Sharpe Ratios, it is shown that the Bitcoin provides risk-adjusted returns over and above most asset classes. Research limitations/implications - The aim of this research is to present a normative exploration into the asset class nature of the Bitcoin and, as a result, the aim is not to create positivist generalisable conclusions. This paper does not address cryptocurrencies, other than Bitcoin and does not constitute a detailed manual on modern portfolio theory. Originality/value - This research adds to finance paradigm research on the Bitcoin by including a developing country perspective on Bitcoin as an asset class as prior studies have concentrated on developed country settings. Further, this research introduces recent economic data (2014 to 2017) in the form of daily observations to enhance prior understanding.

An analysis of Bitcoin's P2P market indicates that when prices are measured relative to the going market rate, P2P traders in Bitcoin face different premiums and discounts depending on the currency traded, which in turn impacts on the bid-ask spread. In periods of extreme price changes such as the extraordinary price rise in Bitcoin occurring in 2017, measuring bid-ask spreads in relative terms masks the true picture of widening monetary bid-ask spreads.","[Holub, Mark] Univ Western Australia, UWA Business Sch, Nedlands, WA, Australia","University of Western Australia","Holub, M (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, UWA Business Sch, Nedlands, WA, Australia.","mark.holub@uwa.edu.au","","","","","","","11","6","6","2","10","ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE","SAN DIEGO","525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","1544-6123","1544-6131","","FINANC RES LETT","Financ.

The hypothesis that the Bitcoin market is really subject to the formation of financial bubbles, and that the most significant of them was observed in 2017. The phenomenon of cryptocurrency has arisen quite recently and, therefore, at present there are very few empirical and theoretical studies related to this problem. It should be noted that the interest of the scientific community in digital money is growing every year. The digitization of the financial segment is a priority in the framework of Russia's economic growth. As part of the research, the Bitcoin market was analyzed. Several financial bubbles have been identified, and an econometric model of the behavior of the Bitcoin value in the digital virtual instruments market has also been compiled. The relevance and debatable nature of the theoretical and methodological foundations of cryptocurrency in different markets, the high practical significance of digital money in the modern economic system predetermined the goal and objectives, determined the choice of the object of study. Purpose of the study: bitcoin cost behavior modeling in the digital finance market based on time series. The methodological basis of the present study includes the methods of system-structural, functional, factor and comparative analysis with the construction of analytical models based on the synthesis of modern scientific methods of knowledge of economic and social phenomena. The methodological tools of scientific research are graphic, analytical, statistical and economic-mathematical methods of information processing.","[Yuzvovich, L., I] Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Isakova, N.

The findings support the hypothesis that Bitcoin prices are efficient in weak form for the whole period. However, considering the switching between the regimes, it was concluded that there are two regimes in the Bitcoin price series. In the first regime, the hypothesis of efficient markets in the weak form is valid, but not in the second regime.","[Gemici, Eray] Gaziantep Univ, Islahiye Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Isletme Bolumu, Gaziantep, Turkey; [Polat, Muslum] Bingol Univ, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Isletme Bolumu, Bingol, Turkey","Gaziantep University; Bingol University","Gemici, E (corresponding author), Gaziantep Univ, Islahiye Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Isletme Bolumu, Gaziantep, Turkey.","gemici@gantep.edu.tr; mpolat@bingol.edu.tr","","","","","","","33","0","0","2","4","MEHMET AKIF ERSOY UNIV","BURDUR","ANTALYA BURDUR YOLU, BURDUR MERKEZ, BURDUR, 15030, TURKEY","2149-1658","","","J MEHMET AKIF ERSOY","J.

We also find that our results are robust when we use other measures of investor sentiment.","[Baig, Ahmed; Sabah, Nasim] Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, Area Finance, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Blau, Benjamin M.] Utah State Univ, Huntsman Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University","Blau, BM (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Huntsman Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Logan, UT 84322 USA.","ahmed.baig@ttu.edu; ben.blau@usu.edu; nasim.sabah@ttu.edu","","Baig, Ahmed/0000-0002-9167-0733","","","","","22","26","27","5","19","ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE","SAN DIEGO","525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","1544-6123","1544-6131","","FINANC RES LETT","Financ.

Two of Bitcoin's challenges are (i) securing sufficient miner revenues as block rewards decrease, and (ii) alleviating the throughput limitation due to a small maximal block size cap. These issues are strongly related as increasing the maximal block size may decrease revenue due to Bitcoin's pay-your-bid approach. To decouple them, we analyze the monopolistic auction [8], showing: (i) its revenue does not decrease as the maximal block size increases, (ii) it is resilient to an untrusted auctioneer (the miner), and (iii) simplicity for transaction issuers (bidders), as the average gain from strategic bid shading (relative to bidding one's true maximal willingness to pay) diminishes as the number of bids increases.","[Lavi, Ron] Technion, Haifa, Israel; [Sattath, Or] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Zohar, Aviv] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel","Ben Gurion University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem","Lavi, R (corresponding author), Technion, Haifa, Israel.","ronlavi@technion.ac.il; sattath@post.bgu.ac.il; avivz@cs.huji.ac.il","","Sattath, Or/0000-0001-7567-3822","Marie-Curie fellowship Advance-AGT; ARCHES award from the MINERVA foundation; ISF-NSFC joint research program [2560/17]; ERC [280157]; Israel Science Foundation [616/13, 682/18]; Cyber Security Research Center at Ben-Gurion University; Israel National Cyber Bureau [039-9230]; HUJI Cyber Security Research Center","Marie-Curie fellowship Advance-AGT; ARCHES award from the MINERVA foundation; ISF-NSFC joint research program; ERC(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); Cyber Security Research Center at Ben-Gurion University; Israel National Cyber Bureau; HUJI Cyber Security Research Center","We thank Alaa Mozalbat, who designed and implemented the simulation code, and Reshef Meir for valuable discussions.

Lightning networks, a layer on top of Bitcoin, composed of one-to-one lightning channels make it scale to up to 105 Million users. Recently, Duplex Micropayment Channel factories have been proposed based on opening multiple one-to-one payment channels at once. Duplex Micropayment Channel factories rely on time-locks to update and close their channels. This mechanism yields to situation where users funds time-locking for long periods increases with the lifetime of the factory and the number of users. This makes DMC factories not applicable in real-life scenarios. In this paper, we propose the first channel factory construction, the Lightning Factory that offers a constant collateral cost, independent of the lifetime of the channel and members of the factory. We compare our proposed design with Duplex Micropayment Channel factories, obtaining better performance results by a factor of more than 3000 times in terms of the worst-case constant collateral cost incurred when malicious users use the factory. The message complexity of our factory is n where Duplex Micropayment Channel factories need n(2) messages where n is the number of users. Moreover, our factory copes with an infinite number of updates while in Duplex Micropayment Channel factories the number of updates is bounded by the initial time-lock. Finally, we discuss the necessity for our Lightning Factories of BNN, a non-interactive aggregate signature cryptographic scheme, and compare it with Schnorr and ECDSA schemes used in Bitcoin and Duplex Micropayment Channels.","[Pedrosa, Alejandro Ranchal] Sorbonne Univ, CEA LIST, CNRS, UMR 7606,LIP6, Paris, France; [Potop-Butucaru, Maria] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, UMR 7606, LIP6, Paris, France; [Tucci-Piergiovanni, Sara] CEA LIST, PC 174, Gif Sur Yvette, France","CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; CEA","Pedrosa, AR (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, CEA LIST, CNRS, UMR 7606,LIP6, Paris, France.","alejandro.ranchal_pedrosa@etu.upmc.fr; maria.potop-butucaru@lip6.fr; sara.tucci@cea.fr","","","","","","","14","4","4","0","4","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-5933-7","","","","2019","","","","","","","302","309","","10.1145/3297280.3297312","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3297280.3297312","","","8","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BN1NS","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000474685800040","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We contribute to the growing literature of Bitcoin by examining the intraday variables of the leading Bitcoin exchange with the highest information share over 4 years' worth of data to reveal the intraday stylized facts of Bitcoin and how they have developed over time. Employing GMT-timestamped tick data aggregated to the 5-mintuely frequency, we find that Bitcoin returns have increased over time, while trading volume, volatility and liquidity varied substantially over time. We also find that volume increases throughout the day and falls from around 4 pm until midnight, which is consistent with the intraday patterns found in currency markets. Realised volatility is fairly consistent throughout the day although it is highest during the opening times of the three major global stock markets. Also liquidity is highest during the opening times of the major global exchanges and the markets tend to be illiquid during the early morning.

Using these data, we conclude that since June 2018 Bitcoin mining is no longer profitable for commodity miners without access to electricity prices below 0.14 $/kWh. This phenomenon explains why many Western miners have dropped out of the circuit, further increasing the centralization of mining activity in China. In addition, we estimate that the marginal cost of the production of bitcoin is around 1,952 US dollars. Below this price the cost of mining would not be profitable, even with the most efficient equipment and the lowest possible price for the energy required.

However, a more comprehensive, evidence-based picture on the global direct financial impact of ransomware attacks is still missing. In this article, we present a data-driven method for identifying and gathering information on Bitcoin transactions related to illicit activity based on footprints left on the public Bitcoin blockchain. We implement this method on-top-of the GraphSense open-source platform and apply it to empirically analyze transactions related to 35 ransomware families. We estimate the lower bound direct financial impact of each ransomware family and find that, from 2013 to mid-2017, the market for ransomware payments has a minimum worth of USD 12 768 536 (22 967.54 BTC). We also find that the market is highly skewed with only a few number of players responsible for the majority of the payments.

Bitcoin provides a way to transact without any trusted intermediary, but its privacy guarantees are questionable, and multiple deanonymization attacks have been proposed. Cryptocurrency privacy research has been mostly focused on blockchain analysis, i.e., extracting information from the transaction graph. We focus on another vector for privacy attacks: network analysis. We describe the message propagation mechanics in Bitcoin and propose a novel technique for transaction clustering based on network traffic analysis. We show that timings of transaction messages leak information about their origin, which can be exploited by a well connected adversarial node. We implement and evaluate our method in the Bitcoin testnet with a high level of accuracy, deanonymizing our own transactions issued from a desktop wallet (Bitcoin Core) and from a mobile (Mycelium) wallet. Compared to existing approaches, we leverage the propagation information from multiple peers, which allows us to overcome an anti-deanonymization technique (diffusion) used in Bitcoin.","[Biryukov, Alex; Tikhomirov, Sergei] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg","University of Luxembourg","Biryukov, A (corresponding author), Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.","alex.biryukov@uni.lu; sergey.s.tikhomirov@gmail.com","","Biryukov, Alex/0000-0003-1404-6686","","","","","24","6","6","0","7","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2159-4228","","978-1-7281-1878-9","IEEE CONF COMPUT","","","2019","","","","","","","204","209","","","","","","6","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BO7XY","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000526051100035","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this essay, I argue that cryptocurrencies and blockchains are important objects of general social science research and thought, but not for their 'moneyness' per se. Through a historical sociology of the antecedents and discourse leading up to Bitcoin, I show that it was never meant to be 'money' in the economic sense, but rather a solution to a technical puzzle for preventing opportunistic actors from double-spending digital 'coins,' as well as a fervent ideology surrounding online privacy and infringement of individual rights in the digital age. Drawing from themes in science and technology studies, I suggest that Bitcoin and other 'cryptoassets' are properly socio-technological assemblages that constitute new and important objects of social inquiry that must be understood beyond the myopic context of crypto-money. I conclude by proposing three alternative ontologies for blockchains relevant to economic, political, and social life: as systems of accounting, as organizational forms, and as institutions in their own right.","[Hayes, Adam] Univ Wisconsin, Sociol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison","Hayes, A (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Sociol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.","ahayes8@wisc.edu","Hayes, Adam/GVS-6281-2022","Hayes, Adam/0000-0001-5481-8906","","","","","69","29","29","2","34","SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD","LONDON","1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","0263-2764","1460-3616","","THEOR CULT SOC","Theory Cult.

Fast payments are desirable in certain scenarios, for instance, when buying in vending machines, fast food restaurants, or withdrawing from an ATM. Despite being quickly propagated through the network, zero-confirmation transactions are not protected against double-spending attacks, since the double-spending protection Bitcoin offers relies on the blockchain and, by definition, such transactions are not yet included in it. In this paper, we propose a double-spending prevention mechanism for Bitcoin zero-confirmation transactions. Our proposal is based on exploiting the flexibility of the Bitcoin scripting language together with a well-known vulnerability of the ECDSA signature scheme to discourage attackers from performing such an attack.","[Perez-Sola, Cristina; Delgado-Segura, Sergi; Navarro-Arribas, Guillermo; Herrera-Joancomarti, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Informat Engn & Commun, Carrer Sitges S-N,Edifici Q,Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Perez-Sola, Cristina; Delgado-Segura, Sergi; Navarro-Arribas, Guillermo; Herrera-Joancomarti, Jordi] CYBERCAT Ctr Cybersecur Res Catalonia, Tarragona, Spain","Autonomous University of Barcelona","Perez-Sola, C (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Informat Engn & Commun, Carrer Sitges S-N,Edifici Q,Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.;Perez-Sola, C (corresponding author), CYBERCAT Ctr Cybersecur Res Catalonia, Tarragona, Spain.","cperez@deic.uab.cat; sdelgado@deic.uab.cat; gnavarro@deic.uab.cat; jherrera@deic.uab.cat","Pérez-Solà, Cristina/AAC-6445-2019; Navarro-Arribas, Guillermo/AFP-6074-2022; Herrera-Joancomarti, Jordi/B-8627-2009","Pérez-Solà, Cristina/0000-0001-7534-1326; Navarro-Arribas, Guillermo/0000-0003-3535-942X; Herrera-Joancomarti, Jordi/0000-0002-4935-4681","Spanish ministry [TIN2014-55243-P]; Catalan Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR) [2014SGR-691]","Spanish ministry(Spanish Government); Catalan Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR)(Agencia de Gestio D'Ajuts Universitaris de Recerca Agaur (AGAUR))","This work is partially supported by the Spanish ministry under grant number TIN2014-55243-P and the Catalan Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR) Grant 2014SGR-691.","","25","17","18","3","18","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","1615-5262","1615-5270","","INT J INF SECUR","Int.

When a client pays for a bitcoin online, the provider is able to link the client's payment information to the bitcoin sold to that client. To address the privacy concerns of clients, we require that the bitcoin provider cannot tell the relationship between the real identities of clients and the sold bitcoins in the blockchain. This requirement can be effectively achieved by using blind signatures. However, existing blind signature schemes are incompatible with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) which is used by most of the existing bitcoin protocol, thus cannot be applied directly in Bitcoin. In this paper, we propose a new blind signature scheme that allows generating a blind signature compatible with the standard ECDSA. Afterwards, we make use of the new scheme to achieve bitcoin transaction anonymity. The new scheme is built on a variant of the Paillier cryptosystem and its homomorphic properties. As long as the modified Paillier cryptosystem is semantically secure, the new blind signature scheme has blindness and unforgeability.","[Yi, Xun] RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Lam, Kwok-Yan] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University","Yi, X (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.","xun.yi@rmit.edu.au; kwokyan.lam@ntu.edu.sg","Lam, Kwok-Yan/AAG-5325-2020","Lam, Kwok-Yan/0000-0001-7479-7970","National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its Strategic Capability Research Centres Funding Initiative; Australian Research Council (ARC) [DP160100913, DP180103251]","National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its Strategic Capability Research Centres Funding Initiative(National Research Foundation, Singapore); Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council)","This research is supported by the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its Strategic Capability Research Centres Funding Initiative, and Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Projects DP160100913 & DP180103251.","","19","10","10","0","0","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-6752-3","","","","2019","","","","","","","613","620","","10.1145/3321705.3329816","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3321705.3329816","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BP1KI","","Green Accepted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000539861300057","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Previous studies assess performance with simple measures such as the Sharpe ratio. Such measures are insufficient because they do not take into account the bitcoin's specificities, such as the possibilities to diversify risk. Design/methodology/approach The authors use quantitative methodologies to assess the performance of financial assets. Performance is defined as a risk-adjusted return. The authors use regression analysis and measure bitcoin's performance as the constant term (alpha) of the projection of its returns on the returns of relevant factors of risk. Findings Bitcoin has low correlation with the market index and with factor-mimicking portfolios, which indicates opportunities to diversify risk. The performance of bitcoin (alpha) is positive and significant; this result is robust across period and world region specifications. Originality/value This paper adds to the literature by arguing that bitcoin has the nature of common stock, and therefore, its performance has to be assessed with models that are relevant for this type of securities. This paper is the first using performance models that adjust returns for relevant sources of risk.","[Alfieri, Elise; Burlacu, Radu; Enjolras, Geoffroy] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CERAG, Grenoble, France","UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)","Burlacu, R (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, CERAG, Grenoble, France.","elise.alfieri@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr; radu.burlacu@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr; geoffroy.enjolras@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr","Enjolras, Geoffroy/GRI-9967-2022","Enjolras, Geoffroy/0000-0003-3034-7745","","","","","31","7","7","3","17","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1526-5943","2331-2947","","J RISK FINANC","J.

Specifically, we explore the conditional cross effects and volatility spillover between Bitcoin and financial indicators using different multivariate GARCH specifications. The nature of interaction between Bitcoin and financial variables and their transmission mechanisms are taken into account when analyzing the diversification and hedging effectiveness across gold asset and stock market. Our findings suggest that all models confirm the significant returns and volatility spillovers. More importantly, we find that VARMA (1,1)-DCC-GJR-GARCH is the best-fit model for modeling the joint dynamics of a variety of financial assets. We also show that a short position in the Bitcoin market allows hedging the risk investment for all different financial assets. Finally, hedging strategies involving gold, oil, equities and Bitcoin reduce considerably the portfolio's risk, as compared to the risk of the portfolio made up of gold, oil and equities only.","[Guesmi, Khaled; Saadi, Samir] IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France; [Saadi, Samir] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Ftiti, Zied] ISC Paris Business Sch, Paris, France; [Abid, Ilyes] EDC Paris Business Sch, Paris, France","IPAG Business School; University of Ottawa","Guesmi, K (corresponding author), IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France.","khaled.guesmi@ipag.fr","","Guesmi, Khaled/0000-0001-6208-0622","","","","","39","232","233","15","152","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1057-5219","1873-8079","","INT REV FINANC ANAL","Int.

In addition to traditional graph analysis methods, new metrics need to be engineered specifically for the bitcoin transaction graph. Hence, we propose a new centrality measure named mint centrality. The measure uses the inherent tree structure of transactions in bitcoin and their relation to the corresponding set of coinbase transactions, and can be evaluated with linear complexity. We present preliminary results of the mint centrality on the first 200,000 blocks of the public bitcoin blockchain.","[Pontiveros, Beltran Borja Fiz; Steichen, Mathis; State, Radu] Univ Luxembourg, SnT, Sedan Grp, Luxembourg, Luxembourg","University of Luxembourg","Pontiveros, BBF (corresponding author), Univ Luxembourg, SnT, Sedan Grp, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.","beltran.fiz@uni.lu; mathis.steichen@uni.lu; radu.state@uni.lu","","State, Radu/0000-0002-4751-9577","","","","","8","1","1","0","4","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-1328-9","","","","2019","","","","","","","159","162","","","","","","4","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO0IT","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000491257000041","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This paper analyzes the demand for Bitcoin in order to determine whether it stems from Bitcoin's utility as a medium of exchange, a speculative asset, or as a safe-haven commodity. We examine Bitcoin from a monetary-theory perspective and build a demand model that explores both the long-term and short-term relationships among variables. Our findings show that Bitcoin behaves as a speculative asset in the short term. In the long term, however, speculation does not seem to influence demand for Bitcoin. Instead, demand might be driven by expectations regarding Bitcoin's future utility as a medium of exchange.","[de la Horra, Luis P.; de la Fuente, Gabriel] Univ Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain; [Perote, Javier] Univ Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain","Universidad de Valladolid; University of Salamanca","de la Horra, LP (corresponding author), Business & Econ Sch, Dept Financial Econ & Accounting, Ave Valle Esgueva 6, Valladolid 47011, Spain.","luispablo.horra@uva.es","de la Fuente, Gabriel/K-6361-2017; Perote, Javier/E-6235-2016","de la Fuente, Gabriel/0000-0002-6452-9232; de la Horra, Luis Pablo/0000-0002-0419-6499; Perote, Javier/0000-0002-9122-4370","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness [ECO2017-84864-P, ECO2016-75631-P]","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness","We gratefully acknowledge the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness for its funding, under research projects ECO2017-84864-P and ECO2016-75631-P.

The technology is discussed in the perspective of an information infrastructure to investigate its full potential. After a literature review of Bitcoin publications, with a special emphasis on eGovernment literature, the paper presents a relevant use case highlighting the innovation potential of the new technology. The literature review shows that Bitcoin is absent from the e-Government literature.

As a result, several schemes have been proposed over the last few years to speed up the block propagation, most notably the compact block protocol (BIP 152). Despite this, we show experimental evidence that (i) the vast majority (97%) of Bitcoin nodes exhibit intermittent network connectivity (churn), and (ii) this churn results in significant numbers of unsuccessful compact blocks, roughly twice the figure for continuously connected nodes. Specifically, we conduct experiments on the Bitcoin network that show that churn results in a 135% average increase in block propagation time (i.e., 336.57 ms vs 142.62 ms), and can lead to as high as an 800-fold increase in the worst case. To effect our analysis, we develop a statistical model for churn based on empirical network data, and use this model to actuate the live test nodes on the Bitcoin network. The performance of the system is measured by means of a novel framework that we develop for logging the internal behavior of a Bitcoin node and share for public use.","[Imtiaz, Muhammad Anas; Starobinski, David; Trachtenberg, Ari; Younis, Nabeel] Boston Univ, ECE Dept, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Boston University","Imtiaz, MA (corresponding author), Boston Univ, ECE Dept, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","maimtiaz@bu.edu; staro@bu.edu; trachen@bu.edu; nyounis@bu.edu","Imtiaz, Muhammad Anas/F-1092-2018","Imtiaz, Muhammad Anas/0000-0001-6836-6971","NSF [CCF-1563753]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was supported in part by NSF under grant CCF-1563753.","","24","24","24","0","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-1328-9","","","","2019","","","","","","","431","439","","","","","","9","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO0IT","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000491257000079","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We divided this period by the date of August 1, 2017, on which Bitcoin underwent its initial bifurcation. In general, our empirical results show that return and volatility spillovers run in one direction only, i.e., from Bitcoin to Litecoin, before the bifurcation, with the direction of shock transmission being reversed after the bifurcation. We conclude that bifurcation has markedly weakened the market position and pricing influence of Bitcoin within cryptocurrency markets. Since bifurcation is convenient for nearly any cryptocurrency, it will likely continue to pose a risk to the cryptocurrency market as a whole.","[Tu, Zhiyong; Xue, Changyong] Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, Econ, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Peking University","Tu, ZY (corresponding author), Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, Econ, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China.","zytu@phbs.pku.edu.cn; xuecy007@pku.edu.cn","","","","","","","20","18","18","2","3","ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE","SAN DIEGO","525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","1544-6123","1544-6131","","FINANC RES LETT","Financ.

In this article, we show that Bitcoin is a 'new object of concern' that also compels us to reimagine ethnography in a digital age. We present a method, which we term ethno-resonance, that is both a reaction to the conditions presented by the Bitcoin phenomenon and a way of maintaining critical distance from its cyberlibertarian politics. We explicate six aspects of the method, framed around answers to what, why, how, who, when and where questions. Applied to cryptocurrencies, the method leads us to depict Bitcoin as a game, and we analyse the game's dynamics through mapping the interplay between four foundational myths that animate, complicate and sustain the game. More broadly, this contributes to our understanding of the nature of money and alternative currencies.","[Kavanagh, Donncha] Univ Coll Dublin, Coll Business, Informat & Org, Dublin, Ireland; [Miscione, Gianluca] Univ Coll Dublin, Coll Business, Management Informat Syst Grp, Dublin, Ireland; [Ennis, P.

All of which present some limitation when applying them on blockchain-based networks. In this paper, we propose a topology discovery system, which performs a real-time data collection and analysis for Bitcoin P2P links with the use of a customized version of the Page-Rank algorithm that assembles incoming nodes information for deeper graph analysis processing.

This paper evaluates the volatility of Bitcoin returns using three GARCH models (sGARCH, iGARCH, and tGARCH). The new development allows for the modeling of volatility clustering effects, the leptokurtic and the skewed distribution in the return series of Bitcoin. Comparative to the Students' t-distribution and the Generalized error distribution, the Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) distribution captured adequately the leptokurtic and skewness in all the GARCH models. The tGARCH model was the best model as it described the asymmetric occurrence of shocks in the Bitcoin market. That is, the response of investors to the same amount of good and bad news are distinct. From the empirical results, it can be concluded that tGARCH-NIG was the best model to estimate the volatility in the return series of Bitcoin. Generally, it would be optimal to use the NIG distribution in GARCH type models since time series of most cryptocurrency are leptokurtic.","[Gyamerah, Samuel Asante] Pan African Univ, Inst Basic Sci Technol & Innovat, Dept Math, Juja, Kenya","","Gyamerah, SA (corresponding author), Pan African Univ, Inst Basic Sci Technol & Innovat, Dept Math, Juja, Kenya.","saasgyam@gmail.com","Gyamerah, Samuel Asante/E-6679-2018","Gyamerah, Samuel Asante/0000-0003-2164-2339","","","","","14","19","20","2","16","AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS","SPRINGFIELD","PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA","2573-0134","","","QUANT FINANC ECON","Quant.

Unlike the Granger causality test, we discover that transfer entropy clearly identifies causal interdependency between Bitcoin and other assets, including gold, stocks, and the U.S. dollar. However, for symbolic transfer entropy, the dynamic rise-fall pattern in return series shows an asymmetric information flow from other assets to Bitcoin.

We work under the hypothesis that price is affected by the web footprint of influential people, we refer to them as crypto-influencers. In this paper we provide neural models for predicting bitcoin price. We compare what happens when the model is fed only with recent price history versus what happens when fed, in addition, with a measure of the positivity or negativity of the sayings of these influencers, measured through a sentiment analysis of their twitter posts. We show preliminary evidence that twitter data should indeed help to predict the price of bitcoin, even though the measures we use in this paper have a lot of room for refinement. In particular, we also discuss the challenges of measuring the correct sensation of these posts, and discuss the work that should help improving our discoveries even further.","[Cheuque Cerda, German; Reutter de La Maza, Juan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile","Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile","Cerda, GC (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile.","gacheuque@uc.cl; jreutter@ing.puc.cl","","","","","","","24","7","7","3","12","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-6675-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","755","762","","10.1145/3308560.3316454","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3308560.3316454","","","8","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BN1GH","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000474353100119","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Combined with key-block selfish and stubborn mining, and an eclipse attack, this attack is able to bring extra reward to attackers in Bitcoin-NG than in Bit-coin through a colluded strategy or a destroyed if no stake strategy. Our evaluation calculates the reward proportion of an attacker by these attacks on both Bitcoin-NG and Bitcoin, which helps us figure out whether Bitcoin-NG sacrifices security for efficiency promotion. We also evaluate 18 strategy combinations by traversing different values of computation power and practical truncation rate.

Design/methodology/approach Original data were collected via a survey of 334 participants with experience in Bitcoin speculative investment. The partial least squares method was used to test the proposed model. Findings Speculative investment behavior in the Bitcoin context is driven by strong impulse and weak self-control, leading to negative consequences. The extent of the imbalance between the two cognitive systems is greater with the subjective norm than without it, thus facilitating speculative investment behavior. Noteworthy differences in the impulse and self-control effects on Bitcoin speculative investment are found with differences in Bitcoin objective and subjective knowledge.

For Bitcoin investors, the results imply the ability to use information about the state of global economic uncertainty to enhance the predictions of Bitcoin volatility. We further examine whether the correlation between Bitcoin and global equities, commodities, and bonds are affected by global economic policy uncertainty. Empirical results reveal that global economic policy uncertainty has a negative significant impact on the Bitcoin-bonds correlation and a positive impact on both Bitcoin-equities and Bitcoin-commodities correlations, suggesting the possibility of Bitcoin acting as a hedge under specific economic uncertainty conditions. Interestingly, the hedging effectiveness of Bitcoin for both global equities and global bonds enhances slightly after considering the level of global economic policy uncertainty. Such a weak effect of the state of global economic uncertainty on the hedging ability of Bitcoin implies that investors cannot substantially enhance the hedging performance of Bitcoin under different economic uncertainty conditions.","[Fang, Libing] Nanjing Univ, Sch Management & Engn, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Bouri, Elie] Holy Spirit Univ Kaslik, USEK Business Sch, Jounieh, Lebanon; [Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Roubaud, David] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France","Nanjing University; University of Pretoria; Montpellier Business School","Bouri, E (corresponding author), Holy Spirit Univ Kaslik, USEK Business Sch, Jounieh, Lebanon.","lbfang@nju.edu.cn; eliebouri@usek.edu.lb; rangan.gupta@up.ac.za; cl.roubaud@montpellier-bs.com","fang, libing/W-6528-2019; Bouri, Elie/N-1368-2015; ROUBAUD, DAVID/ABA-8123-2020; Bouri, Elie/ABC-4197-2020","Bouri, Elie/0000-0003-2628-5027; ROUBAUD, DAVID/0000-0003-3827-6187; Bouri, Elie/0000-0003-2628-5027","","","","","48","119","120","10","62","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1057-5219","1873-8079","","INT REV FINANC ANAL","Int.

Transactions without fees are given low priority and likely to wait for confirmation. Because the demand of micro payment in Bitcoin is expected to increase due to low remittance cost, it is important to quantitatively investigate how transactions with small fees of Bitcoin affect the transaction-confirmation time. In this paper, we analyze the transaction-confirmation time by queueing theory. We model the transaction-confirmation process of Bitcoin as a priority queueing system with batch service, deriving the mean transaction-confirmation time. Numerical examples show how the demand of transactions with low fees affects the transaction-confirmation time.

Utilizing the unprecedented data availability of Bitcoin statistics, we are able to construct a theoretical exchange rate base of the cryptocurrency with respect to the US dollar. Through the concept of statistical equilibrium verified by the cointegration relationship, we show several interesting points. First, the Bitcoin price dynamics is very well captured by the underlying transaction data which leads to a strong fundamental basis of the cryptocurrency. Second, several historical bubbles hit the confidence intervals around the fundamental price but then start their correction back to the equilibrium. Third, the fundamental price implied by the transaction data is not ever-increasing but reflects the ups and downs of Bitcoin utility in transactions. And fourth, our theory-implied fundamental price suggests that the current (December 2018) Bitcoin price is very close to its fundamental price estimated at around $3,500. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we explore the features of jumps, which are discontinuous movements, by examining Bitcoin pricing. First, we identify jumps in the Bitcoin price on a daily basis, applying a non-parametric methodology and then break down the Bitcoin total rate of return into a jump rate of return and a continuous rate of return. In our empirical analysis, price jumps turn out to be independent of volatility. Moreover, the jumps in the Bitcoin price do not appear at regular intervals; rather, they tend to be concentrated in clusters during special periods, implying that once an economic crisis occurs, the crisis will last for a long time due to contagion effects and the economy will take a considerable amount of time to recover fully. Further, the contribution of the jump rate of return to the total rate of return of the Bitcoin price is lower than the contribution of the continuous return, implying that the pursuit of sustainable returns rather than large but temporary returns will improve the total rate of return over the long term. Finally, more jumps are observed when trading volume is lower, implying that market illiquidity drives discontinuous movement in asset prices. Overall, the features of jump risk are like two sides of the same coin and jump risks are expected to have a significant effect on asset pricing, suggesting that consideration of jumps is essential for risk management as well as asset pricing.","[Kang, Naeyoung] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Business, 85 Hoegi Ro, Seoul 02455, South Korea; [Kim, Jungmu] Yeungnam Univ, Sch Business, Dept Business Adm, 280 Daehak Ro, Gyongsan 38541, Gyeongbuk, South Korea","Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Yeungnam University","Kim, J (corresponding author), Yeungnam Univ, Sch Business, Dept Business Adm, 280 Daehak Ro, Gyongsan 38541, Gyeongbuk, South Korea.","jksk2922@kaist.ac.kr; jungmu@yu.ac.kr","","Kim, Jungmu/0000-0001-7534-4359","Yeungnam University","Yeungnam University","This work was supported by the 2017 Yeungnam University Research Grant.","","33","3","3","0","5","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2071-1050","","SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL","Sustainability","APR 1","2019","11","7","","","","","","","2012","10.3390/su11072012","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11072012","","","11","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","HW2WV","","gold, Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000466551600189","View Full Record in Web of Science"

To diversify the sample, we include five very different countries in our study: Japan, Venezuela, China, Estonia, and Sweden. Using daily data over the period 2014-2017, we estimate the dynamic conditional correlation model between main stock indices and bitcoin price in local currencies (Bitflyer - in the case of the yen, Kraken - in the case of the euro, Huobi in the case of yuan and LocalBitcoins in all the remaining cases), as well as between main stock indices and the bitcoin price in the US dollar (Bitfinex exchange). We apply the Stochastic Volatility Model with the Dynamic Conditional Correlation. We add binary variables into the dynamic correlation equation, indicating the occurrence of extreme return on the stock-exchange index in the lower 1%, 5% and 10% quantile. The conclusions vary, depending whether we consider trade on the local bitcoin exchanges or in the global one. We conclude that bitcoin was treated as a safe haven asset only in the case of Venezuela and investments in bolivars. In the case of local investments in Japan and China bitcoin behaved as a diversifier. In the bitcoin-friendly economies of Sweden and Estonia it acted as a weak hedge. In the case of the USD trade, the results suggest that bitcoin is a weak hedge with respect to all of the analyzed markets. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, the blockchain which is the basic technology can be accessed by anyone, and the transaction stored in the block can be checked anytime. Recent research has reported that anonymity of such a bitcoin P2P network is low, regardless of whether peer uses the anonymizers like TOR to keep the anonymity. This fact shows the risk of the malicious users being able to use this public information without exception. However, when the malicious user is hiding behind the network and browsing public information, it is difficult to distinguish between a malicious user and a honest one, and it is a challenge to detect signs of hidden threats. In this research, we propose a data mining approach to analyze by combining two kinds of IP address distributions: Bitcoion peer and malicious node (not in the bitcoin network), in order to obtain characteristics of hidden users. As a result, we confirmed that the nodes, which matched the first 24 bits of the IP address in the bitcoin network peer, sent the packet to the darknet. The contribution of this paper is three-fold: (1) we employ a novel approach to analyze a bitcoin network using Darknet dataset, (2) we identify the malicious node in the same network as the honest peer, and (3) we clarify the network deployments of Bitcoin peers and malicious nodes.","[Imamura, Mitsuyoshi; Omote, Kazumasa] Univ Tsukuba, Tennodai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan; [Imamura, Mitsuyoshi] Nomura Asset Management Ltd, Chuo Ku, 1-11-1 Nihonbashi, Tokyo 1038260, Japan","University of Tsukuba","Imamura, M; Omote, K (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Tennodai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan.;Imamura, M (corresponding author), Nomura Asset Management Ltd, Chuo Ku, 1-11-1 Nihonbashi, Tokyo 1038260, Japan.","ic140tg528@gmail.com; omote@risk.tsukuba.ac.jp","","","","","","","24","0","0","0","1","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-17982-3; 978-3-030-17981-6","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2019","11402","","","","","","117","128","","10.1007/978-3-030-17982-3_10","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-17982-3_10","","","12","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Mathematics","BS7SQ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000766408800010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Cryptocurrency exchanges, which act as the gateway to this world, now play a dominant role in the circulation of Bitcoin. Thus, delving into the analysis of the transaction patterns of exchanges can shed light on the evolution and trends in the Bitcoin market, and participants can gain hints for identifying credible exchanges as well. Not only Bitcoin practitioners but also researchers in the financial domains are interested in the business intelligence behind the curtain. However, the task of multiple exchanges exploration and comparisons has been limited owing to the lack of efficient tools. Previous methods of visualizing Bitcoin data have mainly concentrated on tracking suspicious transaction logs, but it is cumbersome to analyze exchanges and their relationships with existing tools and methods. In this paper, we present BitExTract, an interactive visual analytics system, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to explore the evolutionary transaction patterns of Bitcoin exchanges from two perspectives, namely, exchange versus exchange and exchange versus client. In particular. BitExTract summarizes the evolution of the Bitcoin market by observing the transactions between exchanges over time via a massive sequence view. A node-link diagram with ego-centered views depicts the trading network of exchanges and their temporal transaction distribution. Moreover, BitExTract embeds multiple parallel bars on a timeline to examine and compare the evolution patterns of transactions between different exchanges. Three case studies with novel insights demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our system.","[Yue, Xuanwu; Shu, Xinhuan; Zhu, Xinyu; Du, Xinnan; Yu, Zheqing; Papadopoulos, Dimitrios] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Siyuan] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park","Yue, XW (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","xuanwu.yue@connect.ust.hk; xinhuan.shu@connect.ust.hk; xzhuah@connect.ust.hk; xduac@connect.ust.hk; zyuaf@connect.ust.hk; dipapado@cse.ust.hk; sxl68@psu.edu","","","RGC GRF [16208514]; NFSC [61572488, 61673241]","RGC GRF(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); NFSC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","We would like to thank all the reviewers and domain experts for their valuable comments.

The adversary thus impedes the victim from getting the latest blockchain state. It only takes as few as one Bitcoin full node and two light weight nodes to perform the attack. The light weight nodes perform a subset of the functions of a full Bitcoin node. The attack exploits a recent block propagation protocol introduced in April 2016. The protocol prescribes a Bitcoin node to select 3 neighbors that can send new blocks unsolicited. These neighbors are selected based on their recent performance in providing blocks quickly. The adversary induces the victim to select 3 attack nodes by having attack nodes send valid blocks to, the victim more quickly than other neighbors. For this purpose, the adversary deploys a handful of light weight nodes so that the adversary itself receives new blocks faster. The adversary then performs the attack to delay blocks propagated to the victim. We implement attack on top of current default Bitcoin protocol We deploy the attack nodes in multiple locations around the globe and randomly select victim nodes. Depending on the round-trip time between the adversary and the victim, 50%-85% of the blocks could be delayed to the victim. We further show that the adoption of light weight nodes greatly increases the attack probability by 15% in average. Finally, we propose several countermeasures to mitigate this eclipse attack.","[Walck, Matthew; Wang, Ke; Kim, Hyong S.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Carnegie Mellon University","Walck, M (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.","mwalck@andrew.cmu.edu; kewang1@andrew.cmu.edu; kim@ece.cmu.edu","","","","","","","16","11","11","0","1","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-4693-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","1","9","","10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00010","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00010","","","9","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO8PX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000528931600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Therefore from the security forensics aspect, it is demanded to establish an approach to identify newly emerged darknet markets' transactions and addresses. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze Bitcoin transactions and addresses related to darknet markets and propose a novel identification method of darknet markets' addresses. To improve the identification performance, we propose a voting based method which decides the labels of multiple addresses controlled by the same user based on the number of the majority label. Through the computer simulation with more than 200K Bitcoin addresses, it was shown that our voting based method outperforms the nonvoting based one in terms of precision, recal, and F1 score. We also found that DNM's addresses pay higher fees than others, which significantly improves the classification.","[Kanemura, Kota; Toyoda, Kentaroh; Ohtsuki, Tomoaki] Keio Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan","Keio University","Kanemura, K (corresponding author), Keio Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.","kanemura@ohtsuki.ics.keio.ac.jp; toyoda@ics.keio.ac.jp; ohtsuki@ics.keio.ac.jp","","Ohtsuki, Tomoaki/0000-0003-3961-1426","","","","","13","10","10","1","5","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-1328-9","","","","2019","","","","","","","154","158","","","","","","5","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO0IT","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000491257000040","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Bitcoin is one of the most famous cryptocurrency with an estimated market capitalisation of nearly $ 69 billion. The fact that Bitcoin prices have fallen about 70% from their peak value and most indices were down double-digit year to date (2018) with a high daily volatility create the appearance that there has to be a correlation. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the contagion effect between Bitcoin prices and the leading American, European and Asian equity markets using the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model proposed by Engle and Sheppard (2001). Contagion is defined in this context as the statistical break in the computed DCCs as measured by the shifts in their means and medians. Even it is astonishing that the contagion is lower during price bubbles, the main finding indicates the presence of contagion in the different indices among the three continents and proves the presence of structural changes during the Bitcoin bubble. Moreover, the analysis shows that specific market indices are more correlated with the Bitcoin price than others.","[Cekuls, Andrejs] Univ Latvia, Fac Business Management & Econ, Riga, Latvia; [Koehn, Maximilian-Benedikt] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia","University of Latvia; University of Latvia","Cekuls, A (corresponding author), Univ Latvia, Fac Business Management & Econ, Riga, Latvia.","","Cekuls, Andrejs/V-2423-2018","Cekuls, Andrejs/0000-0003-3696-818X","","","","","24","0","0","0","2","UNIV LATVIA","RIGA","19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA","","","978-9934-18-428-4","","","","2019","","","","","","","159","170","","","","","","12","Business; Economics","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics","BN9PJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000489530100015","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Being the most expensive and the most popular cryptocurrency, both the business world and the research community have started to question the energy intensity of Bitcoin mining. This paper only focuses on computational power demand during the proof-of-work process rather than estimating the whole energy intensity of mining. We make use of 160GB of Bitcoin blockchain data to estimate the energy consumption and power demand of Bitcoin mining. We considered the performance of 269 different hardware models (CPU, GPU, FPGA, and ASIC). For estimations, we defined two metrics, namely; minimum consumption and maximum consumption. The targeted time span for the analysis was from 3 January 2009 to 5 June 2018. We show that the historical peak of power consumption of Bitcoin mining took place during the bi-weekly period commencing on 18 December 2017 with a demand of between 1.3 and 14.8 GW. This maximum demand figure was between the installed capacities of Finland (similar to 16 GW) and Denmark (similar to 14 GW). We also show that, during June 2018, energy consumption of Bitcoin mining from difficulty recalculation was between 15.47 and 50.24 TWh per year.","[Kufeoglu, Sinan] Univ Cambridge, Energy Policy Res Grp, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Ozkuran, Mahmut] Istanbul Tech Univ, Sch Arts & Social Sci, TR-34467 Istanbul, Turkey","University of Cambridge; Istanbul Technical University","Kufeoglu, S (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Energy Policy Res Grp, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.","s.kufeoglu@jbs.cam.ac.uk","Küfeoğlu, Sinan/X-2510-2019","Küfeoğlu, Sinan/0000-0002-2269-5064","","","","","15","22","22","7","55","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","2214-6296","2214-6326","","ENERGY RES SOC SCI","Energy Res.

Whether constituted by paper or protocol, whether performing (or failing) as a store of wealth, a medium of exchange, or unit of account, bank notes and bitcoins enact interchangeable equivalence with themselves, every one-pound note or bitcoin the same as another, and their mode of passing hand-to-hand or peer-to-peer also conscripts their holders as readily interchangeable. This essay examines the different ways that these two types of currency engineered this standardization, and I show how the new blockchain technology of Bitcoin innovated upon the standardizing process that made bank notes interchangeable. As I recount in the essay's first half, standardizing physical bank notes involved re-imagining them detached from the temporality of any specific contractual transaction so as to be, like coin, grasped as immediately physically interchangeable, and the bank note used print and the act of reading to do so. In the essay's second half, I discuss how, by contrast, Bitcoin standardizes money not by operating on any physical object, not even a digital one, but by creating a sense of immediately fungible value through maintaining the unique historicity of every transaction in the system.","[Grossman, Jonathan H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept English, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA","University of California System; University of California Los Angeles","Grossman, JH (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept English, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.","jhg@ucla.edu","","","","","","","34","3","3","3","8","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1753-0350","1753-0369","","J CULT ECON-UK","J.

For completeness, the existing predictive models for stock returns that account for both country-specific and common factors are singly and jointly compared with BTC-based predictive model. The analyses are conducted for both in- and out-of-sample forecasts with multiple forecast horizons. The following results are evident in the paper. First, the paper fords evidence in favour of BTC in terms of individual in-sample forecast performance albeit the reverse for interest rate. However, the common factors appear to compete fairly with Bitcoin as the former consistently outperform the latter in three countries. Second, in terms of forecast combination, the stock returns of the G7 countries are better predicted by BTC-based model than their respective macroeconomic variables combined except for Japan. Third, while the out-of-sample forecast results for short forecast horizon reflect those obtained for the in-sample period; the performance however seems to diminish over longer forecast horizon. This is underscored by the fact that investors in the Bitcoin market often speculate over short periods due to the market tendency for higher volatility (risk). Fourth, we also test whether accounting for structural breaks matters in the BTC-based predictive model and the results largely suggest otherwise except for the out-of sample forecast of USA. Overall, the predictive power of Bitcoin can be exploited when modelling stock returns particularly over the period coinciding with high volumes of Bitcoin transactions.","[Salisu, Afees A.] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Dept Management Sci & Technol Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Salisu, Afees A.] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Business Adm, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Isah, Kazeem] Univ Ibadan, Ctr Econometr & Allied Res, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Akanni, Lateef O.] Univ Lagos, Dept Econ, Lagos, Nigeria","Ton Duc Thang University; Ton Duc Thang University; University of Ibadan; University of Lagos","Salisu, AA (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Dept Management Sci & Technol Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.","afees.adebare.salisu@tdt.edu.vn; kz.isah@cear.org.ng","Akanni, lateef/R-2686-2016; salisu, afees/N-1304-2018","Akanni, lateef/0000-0002-5495-1173; salisu, afees/0000-0003-0619-6545","","","","","47","28","28","1","14","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1062-9408","1879-0860","","N AM J ECON FINANC","N.

Despite Bitcoin being in the spotlight, a gap in the literature on its price-setting behaviors has been observed. This study aims to contribute to the literature by investigating the relationship between Bitcoin price and volume in the period between January 1, 2012 and April 7, 2018 through a symmetric and asymmetric causality test. Design/methodology/approach Daily price and volume data relevant to Bitcoin traded in the Bitstamp market were obtained from . Within the framework of data applicable for analysis, the data set for this study includes a total of 2,286 observations for the period between January 1, 2012 and April 7, 2018. Findings Based on the results of the standard causality test, a causality relationship was determined from price to volume. Based on the results of the asymmetric causality test between positive and negative shocks of variables, a unilateral causality relationship was determined from negative shocks in Bitcoin prices to negative shocks in trading volume as well as from positive shocks in trading volume to positive shocks in prices. Furthermore, it was found that the relationship between Bitcoin price and volume is cointegrated. Practical implications - The empirical results can be used by investors and portfolio managers to make trading decisions. Originality/value The contribution of this paper to the literature is that it is the first study on the symmetric and asymmetric causality relationship between Bitcoin price and volume. Moreover, this paper reveals short- and long-term behaviors of Bitcoin using the cointegration test used for determining the long-term relationship between Bitcoin price and volume.","[Gemici, Eray] Gaziantep Univ, Dept Business & Adm, Gaziantep, Turkey; [Polat, Muslum] Bingol Univ, Dept Business & Adm, Bingol, Turkey","Gaziantep University; Bingol University","Gemici, E (corresponding author), Gaziantep Univ, Dept Business & Adm, Gaziantep, Turkey.","gemici@gantep.edu.tr","","","","","","","22","2","2","1","7","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1526-5943","2331-2947","","J RISK FINANC","J.

However, it has been widely reported that it can be used for investment scams, which are referred to as high yield investment programs (HYIP). Although from the security forensic point of view it is very important to identify the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses, so far in the open technical literature no systematic method which reliably collects and identifies such Bitcoin addresses has been proposed. In this paper, a novel methodology is introduced, which efficiently collects a large number of the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses and identifies them based upon a novel analysis of their transactions history. In particular, a scraping-based method is first proposed which is able to collect more than 2,000 HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses from the Internet thus providing a large number of the HYIPs' samples. Second, a supervised machine learning technique, which classifies, whether or not, specific Bitcoin addresses belong to the HYIP operators, is introduced and its performance is evaluated. The proposed classification method is based upon two novel approaches, namely the rate conversion technique that mitigates the effect of Bitcoin price volatility and the sampling technique that reduces the computational amount without sacrificing the classification performance. By employing close to 30,000 real Bitcoin addresses, extensive performance evaluation results obtained by means of computer simulation experiments have shown that the proposed methodology achieves excellent performance, i.e., 95% of the HYIP addresses can be correctly classified, while maintaining a false positive rate less than 4.9%. In order to further validate the proposed classifier's ability to detect the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses, our designed classifier has been tested against a recently published list of the HYIP addresses maintaining its excellent detection accuracy by achieving a 93.75% success rate.","[Toyoda, Kentaroh] ASTAR, Singapore Inst Mfg Technol, Singapore 138634, Singapore; [Toyoda, Kentaroh] Keio Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan; [Ohtsuki, Tomoaki] Keio Univ, Dept Informat & Comp Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan; [Mathiopoulos, P.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency or virtual money derived from mathematical cryptography and is conceived as an alternative to government authorised currency. The founder anticipated, through bitcoin's construction and his digital mining processes, that bitcoin prices would be relatively stable. However, the recent bitcoin price decline proves that bitcoin is extraordinarily volatile and is not that stable as hoped. Although some scientists have already shown that the fundamental value of bitcoin is zero, the price of bitcoin has reached over 19.000$ in December 2018. Since then, bitcoin prices dropped nearly 70% from their peak value and showed in addition to that the typical trends of a speculative bubble. Hyman Minsky and Charles Kindleberger discussed three different patterns of speculative bubbles. One is when price rises in an accelerating way and then crashes very sharply after reaching its peak. Another is when the price rises and is followed by a more similar decline after reaching its peak. The third is when the price rises to a peak, which is then followed by a period of gradual decline known as the period of financial distress, to be followed by a much sharper crash at some later time. One of the key findings of this study is that all these three patterns occurred during 2017-18 for the bitcoin price. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to analyse the historical bitcoin prices in context with the typical five-step characteristics of a speculative bubble. Furthermore, each phase of a speculative bubble is explained by a behavioural finance approach and answer the price development of this cryptocurrency. The result is frightening, bitcoin can be seen as a perfect textbook example of a speculative bubble.","[Koehn, Maximilian-Benedikt; Cekuls, Andrejs] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia","University of Latvia","Koehn, MB (corresponding author), Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.","","Cekuls, Andrejs/V-2423-2018","Cekuls, Andrejs/0000-0003-3696-818X","","","","","38","0","0","0","1","UNIV LATVIA","RIGA","19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA","","","978-9934-18-428-4","","","","2019","","","","","","","410","420","","","","","","11","Business; Economics","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics","BN9PJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000489530100038","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin does not rely on a centralized authority to control the supply, distribution, and verification of the validity of transactions. Instead, Bitcoin relies on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of volunteers to distribute pending transactions and confirmed blocks, to verify transactions, and to collectively implement a replicated ledger that everyone agrees on. This P2P network is at the heart of Bitcoin and many other blockchain technologies. In this paper, we present a comparative measurement study of nodes in the Bitcoin network. We measure and analyze how many the so-called volunteers are in the Bitcoin P2P network by scanning the live Bitcoin network for 37 days in 2018 and compare them with the data reported by prior work in 2013 similar to 2016. This paper is motivated by the fact that Bitcoin has experienced explosive growth in terms of a number of users, transactions, value, and interest over a recent couple of years. Our investigation includes the IP addresses of Bitcoin nodes, size of the network, power law in the geographic distribution, protocol, and client versions, and network latencies and shows how today's network is different from early days. In addition, based on the observations made from the measurement study, we propose a simple distance-based peer selection rule for improved connectivity and faster data propagation. The evaluation results show that our proposed lightweight and backward-compatible peer selection rule has the potential to reduce data dissemination latency.","[Park, Sehyun; Im, Seongwon; Seol, Youhwan; Paek, Jeongyeup] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 06974, South Korea","Chung Ang University","Paek, J (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 06974, South Korea.","jpaek@cau.ac.kr","Paek, Jeongyeup/T-4780-2018","Paek, Jeongyeup/0000-0001-5177-4936","Chung-Ang University Research Grants; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2017R1D1A1B03031348]","Chung-Ang University Research Grants; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education","This work was supported in part by the Chung-Ang University Research Grants and in part by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education under Grant NRF-2017R1D1A1B03031348.","","32","31","30","3","13","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2019","7","","","","","","57009","57022","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2914098","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2914098","","","14","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","HY9RL","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000468478900001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Since Bitcoin trading exhibits excess volatility compared with other securities, it is important to model its risk and returns. We consider heavy-tailed GARCH models as well as GAS models based on the score function of the predictive conditional density of the bitcoin returns. We compare out-of-sample 1%-Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasts under 45 different specifications using three backtesting procedures. We find that GAS models with heavy-tailed distributions provide the best out-of-sample forecast and goodness-of-fit properties to bitcoin returns and risk modelling. Normally-distributed GARCH models are always outperformed by heavy-tailed GARCH or GAS models. Besides, heavy-tailed GAS models provide the best conditional and unconditional coverage for 1%-VaR forecasts, illustrating the importance of modelling excess kurtosis for bitcoin returns. Hence, our findings have important implications for risk managers and investors for using bitcoin in optimal hedging or investment strategies.","[Troster, Victor] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Appl Econ, Ctra Valldemossa Km 7-5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain; [Tiwari, Aviral Kumar; Shahbaz, Muhammad] Montpellier Business Sch, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34080 Montpellier, France; [Nicolas Macedo, Demian] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Business Econ, Ctra Valldemossa Km 7-5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain","Universitat de les Illes Balears; Montpellier Business School; Universitat de les Illes Balears","Troster, V (corresponding author), Univ Illes Balears, Dept Appl Econ, Ctra Valldemossa Km 7-5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain.","victor.troster@uib.es; a.tiwari@montpellier-bs.com; m.shahbaz@montpellier-bs.com; demian.macedo@uib.es","macedo, demian/ABH-1264-2020; TROSTER, VICTOR EMILIO/K-5928-2019; Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/C-5556-2011","macedo, demian/0000-0002-2719-3530; TROSTER, VICTOR EMILIO/0000-0002-8798-5601; Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/0000-0002-1822-9263","Spain's Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura y Deporte [ECO2017-83255-C3-2-1]","Spain's Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura y Deporte","The authors acknowledge helpful comments and suggestions received from the Editor, Narjess Boubakri, and three anonymous referees.

This paper relies on a Bayesian framework that combines market-neutral information with subjective beliefs to show an application of how Bitcoin can be exploited to build diversified investment strategies. By means of an intuitive procedure based on the Black and Litterman model, I propose to relate portfolio construction with the role of news in generating investors' subjective beliefs, which are computed according to market reactions occurred after similar announcement events in the recent past. To test this approach, the analysis refers to an extremely volatile market phase for Bitcoin such as the interval from mid-2017 to mid-2018. Results indicate that Bitcoin can contribute to improve the risk-adjusted performances of diversified portfolios and that investors' subjective beliefs can help to interpret the fundamental drivers of crypto-currencies' market behaviors. This approach may also stimulate the investigation of more sophisticated strategies built according to the relationships between news and investors' personal views on Bitcoin market dynamics.","[Flori, Andrea] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Milan, Italy","Polytechnic University of Milan","Flori, A (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Milan, Italy.","andrea.flori@polimi.it","","Flori, Andrea/0000-0002-9861-3598","","","","","170","8","8","3","33","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0275-5319","1878-3384","","RES INT BUS FINANC","Res.

Contrary to previous studies, we assess the relationship between Bitcoin and currencies at the hourly frequency since Bitcoin experiences quite large volatility throughout the day. We employ a ADCC model and find that Bitcoin can be an intraday hedge for the CHF, EUR and GBP, but acts as a diversifier for the AUD, CAD and JPY. We also implement the non-temporal Hansen (2000) test to examine the safe haven properties of Bitcoin and find that Bitcoin is a safe haven during periods of extreme market turmoil for the CAD, CHF and GBP. Therefore our results indicate that Bitcoin does act as an intraday hedge, diversifier and safe haven for certain currencies, which will be of great interest to currency, cryptocurrency and high frequency investors alike.","[Urquhart, Andrew] Univ Reading, ICMA Ctr, Henley Business Sch, Reading, Berks, England; [Zhang, Hanxiong] Univ Sheffield, Management Sch, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England","University of Reading; University of Sheffield","Urquhart, A (corresponding author), Univ Reading, ICMA Ctr, Henley Business Sch, Reading, Berks, England.","a.j.urquhart@icmacentre.ac.uk; hanxiong.zhang@sheffield.ac.uk","","URQUHART, ANDREW/0000-0001-8834-4243","","","","","43","164","167","11","73","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1057-5219","1873-8079","","INT REV FINANC ANAL","Int.

In this paper we address the question to what extent this novel cryptocurrency market can be viewed as a classic or semi-efficient market. Novel and robust tools for estimation of multi-fractal properties are used to show that the bitcoin price exhibits a very interesting multi-scale correlation structure. This structure can be described by a power-law behavior of the variances of the returns as functions of time increments and it can be characterized by two parameters, the volatility and the Hurst exponent. These power-law parameters, however, vary in time. A new notion of generalized Hurst exponent is introduced which allows us to check if the multi-fractal character of the underlying signal is well captured. It is moreover shown how the monitoring of the power-law parameters can be used to identify regime shifts for the bitcoin price. A novel technique for identifying the regimes switches based on a goodness of fit of the local power-law parameters is presented. It automatically detects dates that can be associated with some known events in the bitcoin market place. A very surprising result is moreover that, despite the wild ride of the bitcoin price in recent years and its multi-fractal and non-stationary character, this price has both local power-law behaviors and a very orderly correlation structure when it is observed on its entire period of existence.

With Google search volumes as a baseline, we find that Reddit submissions are both correlated with Google and have a comparable relationship with a variety of bitcoin metrics, using Spearman's rho. Reddit provides complete access to the text of submissions. Rather than associating sentiment with market activity, we describe the DDPWI method for finding specific 'price dynamic' words associated with changes in the bitcoin pricing pattern through 2017 and 2018. We assess the significance of these changes using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Tests with Bonferroni corrections. These price dynamic words are used to pull out associated words in the submissions thereby providing the context to their use. For example, the price dynamic word 'ban', which became significantly higher in frequency as prices fell, occurred in the context of both government regulation and internet companies banning cryptocurrency adverts. This approach could be used more generally to look at social media and discussion forums at a granular level identifying specific words that impact the metric under investigation rather than overall sentiment.","[Burnie, Andrew; Yilmaz, Emine] Alan Turing Inst, London, England; [Burnie, Andrew; Yilmaz, Emine] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London, England","University of London; University College London","Burnie, A (corresponding author), Alan Turing Inst, London, England.;Burnie, A (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London, England.","aburnie@turing.ac.uk","","Burnie, Andrew/0000-0002-8700-3786","Alan Turing Institute under the EPSRC [EP/N510129/1, TU/C/000028]","Alan Turing Institute under the EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This work was supported by The Alan Turing Institute under the EPSRC grant no.

First, we analyze the Blockchain statistics and social network trends of Bitcoin as inputs to our model, including the liveness of Blockchain wallet, the scale of active Blockchain nodes and the impact factor of Google, Reddit, Twitter to name a few. Next, we implement the LSTM-based prediction model and evaluate it in various historical window sizes and network parameters.

The transaction efficiency among nations and the privacy benefiting from address anonymity of the Bitcoin network have attracted many activities such as payments, investments, gambling, and even money laundering in the past decade. Unfortunately, some criminal behaviors which took advantage of this platform were not identified. This has discouraged many governments to support cryptocurrency. Thus, the capability to identify criminal addresses becomes an important issue in the cryptocurrency network. In this paper, we propose new features in addition to those commonly used in the literature to build a classification model for detecting abnormality of Bitcoin network addresses. These features include various high orders of moments of transaction time (represented by block height) which summarizes the transaction history in an efficient way. The extracted features are trained by supervised machine learning methods on a labeling category data set. The experimental evaluation shows that these features have improved the performance of Bitcoin address classification significantly. We evaluate the results under eight classifiers and achieve the highest Micro-F1 / Macro-F1 of 87% / 86% with LightGBM.","[Lin, Yu-Jing; Wu, Po-Wei; Hsu, Cheng-Han; Liao, Shih-wei] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Taipei, Taiwan; [Tu, I-Ping] Acad Sinica, Inst Stat Sci, Taipei, Taiwan","National Taiwan University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan","Lin, YJ (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.","r06922068@ntu.edu.tw","","Tu, I-Ping/0000-0001-8666-8391","","","","","32","16","16","3","14","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-1328-9","","","","2019","","","","","","","302","310","","","","","","9","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO0IT","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000491257000064","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Second, we estimate several unobservable economic concepts instead of utilizing proxy variables as is usually done. We find that the main factor driving the Bitcoin price is its popularity. Hence, our result not only confirms some previous findings but reinforces them by providing a better definition of popularity.

In the interactions with the full node, the lightweight client leaks considerable information about the Bitcoin transactions or addresses associated with this client. Therefore, the benefit of using lightweight client comes at costs of privacy. Existing solutions cannot support the lightweight client to retrieve the relevant transactions from the full node in an efficient and privacy-preserving way. In this paper, we propose a new approach to protect the privacy of lightweight clients in Bitcoin. Our main idea is to use private information retrieval (PIR) to guarantee that the lightweight clients can fetch the relevant transactions from untrusted full nodes without revealing to those nodes which particular transactions are being fetched. Directly using existing PIR scheme incurs high communication overhead for lightweight clients. Therefore, we propose an optimized protocol utilizing two-step PIR to efficiently retrieve the queried transactions without leaking sensitive query information. We developed a prototype implementation to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed scheme.","[Xie, Yankai; Zhang, Chi; Wei, Lingbo; Niu, Yukun; Wang, Faxing] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Hefei 230027, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Xie, Yankai; Wei, Lingbo] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Informat Secur, Inst Informat Engn, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Engineering, CAS","Xie, YK (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Hefei 230027, Anhui, Peoples R China.;Xie, YK (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Informat Secur, Inst Informat Engn, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.","ykxie@mail.ustc.edu.cn; chizhang@ustc.edu.cn; lingbowei@ustc.edu.cn; xiaoniu@mail.ustc.edu.cn; sa180330@mail.ustc.edu.cn","zhang, chi/GRX-3610-2022","","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0802202]; Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61702474]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under grant 2017YFB0802202, and by the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under grant 61702474.","","21","2","3","1","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-1328-9","","","","2019","","","","","","","440","446","","","","","","7","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO0IT","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000491257000080","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Given the potential of Bitcoin to be involved in a criminal investigation, the need to have an up-to-date and in-depth understanding on the forensic acquisition and analysis of Bitcoins is crucial. However, there has been limited forensic research of Bitcoin in the literature. The general focus of existing research is on postmortem analysis of specific locations (e.g. wallets on mobile devices), rather than a forensic approach that combines live data forensics and postmortem analysis to facilitate the identification, acquisition, and analysis of forensic traces relating to the use of Bitcoins on a system. Hence, the latter is the focus of this paper where we present an open source tool for live forensic and postmortem analysing automatically.

The usability attributes of both systems examined show that respondents perceive the usability of credit/debit cards to be higher than Bitcoin. This has a great negative influence on users' security perceptions of Bitcoin. We conclude that Bitcoin, as a crypto-currency, is still in its infancy and requires user education and a new way of thinking. The study recommends developing users' mental models to deepen developers' understanding of anonymous digital payment technology and improve user centred design. We also make recommendations with respect to e-government services that may be developed relying on crypto-currencies.","[Alshamsi, Abdulla; Andras, Peter] Keele Univ, Sch Comp & Math, Colin Reeves Bldg, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England","Keele University","Alshamsi, A (corresponding author), Keele Univ, Sch Comp & Math, Colin Reeves Bldg, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England.","a.j.a.alshamsi@keele.ac.uk","Andras, Peter/AAV-1194-2020","Andras, Peter/0000-0002-9321-3296","","","","","66","22","22","2","35","ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","LONDON","24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND","1071-5819","1095-9300","","INT J HUM-COMPUT ST","Int.

This paper employs the GARCH Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) model. The sample covers seven developed and six developing countries, five regional indices and 10 commodity series. The results show that Bitcoin acts as a hedge for investors in most of the developing countries such as Brazil, Russia, India and South Korea, but only as a diversifier for investors in developed countries and for commodities. Moreover, Bitcoin acts as a diversifier for all the 10 commodities studied here. During the US election in 2016, Brexit referendum in 2016, and the burst of Chinese market bubble in 2015, Bitcoin acted as a safe haven asset for both the US and non-US investors. Understanding the role of Bitcoin is important for financial market participants who seek protection against market turmoil and downward movements. Furthermore, our findings would be of interests to regulators and governments to engage in more discussion of the role of Bitcoin in financial markets. This paper contributes to the ongoing debate on the usefulness of Bitcoin for investments. Furthermore, it distinguishes the benefits of Bitcoin as a diversifier, hedge and safe haven to investors in the developed versus developing markets.","[Stensas, Anders; Nygaard, Magnus Frostholm; Kyaw, Khine] NTNU, Business Sch, Klaebuvein 72, N-7030 Trondheim, Norway; [Treepongkaruna, Sirimon] Univ Western Australia, UWA Business Sch, 35 Stirling Hwy, Perth, WA 6009, Australia","Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Western Australia","Kyaw, K (corresponding author), NTNU, Business Sch, Klaebuvein 72, N-7030 Trondheim, Norway.","anders_stensaas@hotmail.com; magnusfn@stud.ntnu.no; khine.kyaw@ntnu.no; sirimon.treepongkaruna@uwa.edu.au","Kyaw, Khine/Z-3175-2019","Treepongkaruna, Sirimon/0000-0002-3096-8499","","","","","43","35","36","0","5","TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS","OSLO","KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY","2332-2039","","","COGENT ECON FINANC","Cogent Econ.

The testbed is deployed in a single machine executing four different experiments, each one with different network configuration. We perform a cost analysis to investigate how the resources are related with network parameters and provide experimental data quantifying the amount of computational resources needed to run the different types of simulations.

While a few studies employ conventional statistical and econometric approaches to reveal the driving factors of Bitcoin's prices, research on the development of forecasting models to be used as decision support tools in investment strategies is scarce. This study proposes a computational intelligence technique that uses a hybrid Neuro-Fuzzy controller, namely PATSOS, to forecast the direction in the change of the daily price of Bitcoin. The proposed methodology outperforms two other computational intelligence models, the first being developed with a simpler neuro-fuzzy approach, and the second being developed with artificial neural networks. Furthermore, the investment returns achieved by a trading simulation, based on the signals of the proposed model, are 71.21% higher than the ones achieved through a naive buy-and-hold strategy. The performance of the PATSOS system is robust to the use of other cryptocurrencies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, most of the systems with anonymity and privacy are based on traditional cryptographic algorithms, which may become insecure in the next decades due to the attack of quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a lattice-based distributed e-cash scheme protecting payer's anonymity, which is built upon the framework of Zerocoin and lattice-based zero-knowledge argument. Firstly, payer who owes a transaction redeems it to a newly-minted coin. Secondly, to pay for the next transaction, he/she collects a set of such coins to hide his owns, which can further hide his/her identity. Thirdly, to prove that the payer has one of the coins and no attempts to double-spend have occurred, we adapt a zero-knowledge argument of membership based on a lattice-based accumulator and a commitment protocol.

We also reveal evidence of structural changes in the dynamics of Bitcoin. After accounting for the structural breaks in the level series, evidence of mean reversion is uncovered in some cases.

Our study covers the period 01.05.2014-31.07.2018, as in August 2018 Venezuela changed its currency to Bolivar Soberano. We estimate a threshold vector autoregression model for the returns of all the above- specified assets, where the threshold variable was the return of Venezuelan Stock Exchange General Index (IBC). We allow for three regimes: the extreme upward movements of the index (the hype), the moderate behavior, and the extreme downward changes (the crisis). We verify whether the relationships between the three pairs of assets (IBC and gold, IBC and oil, IBC and bitcoin) change depending on the regime. We also assume that the error term from the regression model follows a GARCH model. Our results suggest that both gold and oil could have been considered a safe-haven asset in a crisis-driven Venezuela, as the instruments changed in the opposite direction to the IBC when the extreme downward movements of the index have been observed. Additionally, their volatility was much smaller and uncorrelated with the volatility of the IBC. Eventually, our results suggest that investing in bitcoin has been considered by the investors as an alternative to investment not only in the moments of the extreme changes of the index, but also in its moderate regime.","[Kliber, Agata] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Fac Informat & Elect Econ, Dept Appl Math, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland; [Swierczynska, Katarzyna] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Journalism & Publ Relat, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland","Poznan University of Economics & Business; Poznan University of Economics & Business","Kliber, A (corresponding author), Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Fac Informat & Elect Econ, Dept Appl Math, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland.","agata.kliber@ue.poznan.pl; Katarzyna.swierczynska@ue.poznan.pl","","Kliber, Agata/0000-0003-1996-5550","Poznan University of Economics and Business","Poznan University of Economics and Business","The research is supported by the Poznan University of Economics and Business under the interdepartmental research grant The future of money: cryptocurrencies, local money and cashless society.","","29","4","4","0","3","MASARYKOVA UNIV","BRNO","ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC","","","978-80-210-9338-6","","","","2019","","","","","","","271","281","","","","","","11","Business; Economics","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics","BO1YK","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000503222600032","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Correspondingly, many researchers have investigated various factors that affect the Bitcoin price and the patterns behind its fluctuations, in particular, using various machine learning methods. In this paper, we study and compare various state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as a deep neural network (DNN), a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, a convolutional neural network, a deep residual network, and their combinations for Bitcoin price prediction. Experimental results showed that although LSTM-based prediction models slightly outperformed the other prediction models for Bitcoin price prediction (regression), DNN-based models performed the best for price ups and downs prediction (classification). In addition, a simple profitability analysis showed that classification models were more effective than regression models for algorithmic trading. Overall, the performances of the proposed deep learning-based prediction models were comparable.","[Ji, Suhwan; Kim, Jongmin; Im, Hyeonseung] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Chuncheon Si 24341, Gangwon Do, South Korea","Kangwon National University","Im, H (corresponding author), Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Chuncheon Si 24341, Gangwon Do, South Korea.","shji@kangwon.ac.kr; jongmin.kim@kangwon.ac.kr; hsim@kangwon.ac.kr","Ji, Suhwan/AAJ-2990-2020","Ji, Suhwan/0000-0001-8934-6099; Im, Hyeonseung/0000-0002-3901-0834","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [2019R1F1A1063272]; Kangwon National University","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Kangwon National University","This work was supported in part by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2019R1F1A1063272) and by a 2015 Research Grant from Kangwon National University.","","34","41","41","4","39","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-7390","","MATHEMATICS-BASEL","Mathematics","OCT","2019","7","10","","","","","","","898","10.3390/math7100898","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math7100898","","","20","Mathematics","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Mathematics","JP6WY","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000498404700027","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Fichte holds that currencies should fulfill an ethical purpose: providing access, in perpetuity, to the material welfare that underwrites citizens' basic rights. In his nineteenth-century context, Fichte argues that currencies fulfill this purpose better when nations control them (i.e., when they are national currencies) than when foreigners freely trade them (as world currencies). After exploring conditions in which national currencies fail to secure material stability over time, e.g., in corrupt regimes, I develop a Fichtean model for ethically evaluating currencies and evaluate the extent to which Bitcoin meets its standards for ethical currency. I argue that Bitcoin undermines the (monetary) power of nations and, as such, threatens their ability to provide access to necessary material goods. While offering citizens a means of defending themselves against corrupt regimes, Bitcoin forsakes the general welfare and is, as such, unethical by Fichtean lights.","[Scharding, Tobey] Rutgers Business Sch Newark & New Brunswick, Dept Management & Global Business, 100 Rockafeller Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Rutgers State University Newark; Rutgers State University New Brunswick","Scharding, T (corresponding author), Rutgers Business Sch Newark & New Brunswick, Dept Management & Global Business, 100 Rockafeller Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.","tscharding@business.rutgers.edu","","","","","","","33","5","5","0","7","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0045-3609","1467-8594","","BUS SOC REV","Bus.

The aim of this study is to identify the preferences of the people using bitcoin as the most famous and valuable cryptocurrency. This paper has particularly investigated the most important factors in choosing bitcoin. In addition to the survey, the least-squares criterion in the model of multiple linear regression was applied to determine the relationship between dependent variable and independent variable. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were also used. It starts with the basic hypothesis that surveyed respondents would show a positive perception for using bitcoin currency in order to get much better satisfaction than by using traditional payment methods, given the very high costs of banking services in the observed countries due to a greater degree of security and privacy of payment transactions. Also, an auxiliary hypothesis has been defined, which reads as follows: the establishment and faster expansion of bitcoin payments depend on the establishment of institutional infrastructure. The research conducted in the South-Eastern Europe countries showed a high correlation between defined dependent variable and independent variable, i.e. a high degree of perception of meeting the needs and expectations of future users by considered bitcoin currency payment technology.","[Nikic, Vinko] Adriatic Univ Bar, Fac Mediterranean Business Studies Tivat, Bar, Montenegro","","Nikic, V (corresponding author), Adriatic Univ Bar, Fac Mediterranean Business Studies Tivat, Bar, Montenegro.;Nikic, V (corresponding author), Luke Tomanovica Br 1, Tivat 85320, Montenegro.","nikicv@t-com.me","","","","","","","28","0","0","0","8","VILNIUS UNIV","VILNIUS","UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA","1648-4460","","","TRANSFORM BUS ECON","Transform.

The consensus is inherently dependent on the value of the asset due to the incentives. The value of these assets frequently fluctuates, which in turn influences the incentive component of the consensus mechanism. For a proof-of-work consensus to be secure, the participation reward must have a perceived real-world value. The future of this perception is not at all clear. The recent 70% drop in the value of Bitcoin versus the US Dollar may be precipitating a circle of declining security of the platform which we explore in depth in this paper. In this paper, we analyze the impact of fluctuations on the security of Bitcoin now, and in the future. We introduce a novel method to examine the rationale of a miner based on the price fluctuations. We integrate our method with an existing security evaluation framework and simulator. Using our approach, we determine and report on the impact of the value of the cryptographic asset on the security of the blockchain given the miner's rationale. Our method allows us to evaluate the impact of different methods of incentive manipulation such as reduced block-reward and transaction fees, by simulation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

There are multiple huge mining pools, and each of them may possess up to 30% of the total computation power of the Bitcoin network (the same applies to some other altcoins). Putting such enormous computation power in the hands of pool operators provides the necessary incentive for them to misuse their power over the network. One way to misuse this power is to launch a block withholding attack against other mining pools. Indeed, this ability starts a block withholding game among the pool operators. Some researchers have analyzed such a game. However, their analyses were limited because they considered simple scenarios, e.g., a single-shot game between only two mining pools. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the block withholding game is a stochastic game with finitely many states and actions. Then, we use a reinforcement learning method to analyze this game. Our simulation results show that in the recent four years, by launching a block withholding attack some pools had the potential to reach to the majority (51%) of the total computation power of the network with much lower initial computation power (even with less than 25% of the total computation power of the network).

In order to allow for an increase of this throughput without increasing orphan blocks, decreasing the block propagation time is important. One of the techniques to improve its block propagation time is to utilize relay networks. However, the effects of utilizing relay networks is not apparent. Existing studies and measurements on relay networks have not focused on the effect of relay networks on the individual miners. Moreover, the relation between the degree of the effect and relay network utilization rate is unknown. Herein, we performed simulations while finely changing the proportion of nodes utilizing a relay network. Moreover we quantitatively evaluated the effect of relay networks on the entire Bitcoin network and individual miners. Results show that the propagation time decrease to approximately 77% of the original value if the utilization rate is set to 3%. This rate is close to the actual utilization rate of relay network Falcon. We also found that the probability of blocks created by utilizing nodes to become orphan blocks is surprisingly smaller than that of the non-utilizing nodes. Even in the worst case, the value of utilizing nodes is 15% of the value of non-utilizing nodes.","[Otsuki, Kai; Aoki, Yusuke; Banno, Ryohei; Shudo, Kazuyuki] Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan","Tokyo Institute of Technology","Otsuki, K (corresponding author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan.","ootuki.k.aa@m.titech.ac.jp; banno@computer.org; shudo@is.titech.ac.jp","Shudo, Kazuyuki/AAQ-1431-2020; Banno, Ryohei/AAB-9445-2019","Banno, Ryohei/0000-0001-7268-4657","SECOM Science and Technology Foundation","SECOM Science and Technology Foundation","This work was supported by SECOM Science and Technology Foundation.","","6","12","13","3","5","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-6849-0","","","","2019","","","","","","","41","46","","10.1145/3340422.3343640","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3340422.3343640","","","6","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BO2BY","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000505073700006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Design/methodology/approach Daily data of bitcoin returns, returns volatility and trading volume (TV) are utilized for the period August 17, 2010-April 16, 2017. Linear and non-linear causality tests are employed to examine price-volume relationship in the bitcoin market. Findings The linear causality analysis indicates that the bitcoin TV cannot be used to predict return; however, the reverse causality is significant. In contrast, the non-linear causality analysis shows that there are non-linear feedbacks between the bitcoin TV and returns. The bitcoin TV, which represents new information, leads to price changes, and large positive price changes lead to increased trading activity. Similarly, in recent periods (post-break period), the results of the non-linear causality test show a unidirectional causality from TV to the volatility of returns. Originality/value The study examines bitcoin's near-stock properties in a price-volume relationship framework with the help of both linear and non-linear causality tests, which to the best of the authors' knowledge remains unexplored.","[Sahoo, Pradipta Kumar] Indian Inst Technol Hyderabad, Liberal Arts, Hyderabad, Telangana, India; [Sethi, Dinabandhu; Acharya, Debashis] Univ Hyderabad, Sch Econ, Hyderabad, Telangana, India","Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Hyderabad; University of Hyderabad","Sahoo, PK (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Hyderabad, Liberal Arts, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.","pradiptaiith@gmail.com","Sahoo, Pradipta Kumar/AAB-8330-2019; Acharya, Debashis/AAD-5781-2019","Sahoo, Pradipta Kumar/0000-0001-9670-2004; Acharya, Debashis/0000-0003-2378-2992; Sethi, Dinabandhu/0000-0002-4571-212X","","","","","44","7","7","0","3","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1743-9132","1758-6569","","INT J MANAG FINANC","Int.

The application of a number of both linear and non-linear GARCH models indicates that the role of extreme price movements is particularly pronounced. GARCH models with student-t innovations as well as combined jump-GARCH models are among the models with the best fit. The role of large movements is found to be stronger in the Bitcoin market than in the markets for crude oil and gold. As Bitcoin shares with these exhaustible resource commodities characteristics such as the fixed supply, the analysis of Bitcoin prices can generally learn from the analysis of exhaustible resource commodities. However, whereas the short-run supply of gold and oil are uncertain, there are no uncertainties on the Bitcoin supply-side. Thus, the observed movements of Bitcoin prices can be interpreted as results of Bitcoin demand shocks. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, lightweight clients use Bloom filters to significantly reduce the amount of bandwidth required to validate a particular transaction. This is despite the fact that research has shown that Bloom filters are insufficient at preserving the privacy of clients' queries. In this paper we describe our design of an SPV protocol that leverages Private Information Retrieval (PIR) to create fully private and performant queries. We show that our protocol has a low bandwidth and latency cost; properties that make our protocol a viable alternative for lightweight Bitcoin clients and other cryptocurrencies with a similar SPV model. In contract to Bloom filters, our PIR-based approach offers deterministic privacy to the user. Among our results, we show that in the worst case, clients who would like to verify 100 transactions occurring in the past week incurs a bandwidth cost of 33.54 MB with an associated latency of approximately 4.8 minutes, when using our protocol. The same query executed using the Bloom-filter-based SPV protocol incurs a bandwidth cost of 12.85 MB; this is a modest overhead considering the privacy guarantees it provides.","[Qin, Kaihua; Hadass, Henryk; Gervais, Arthur] Imperial Coll London, Dept Comp, London, England; [Reardon, Joel] Univ Calgary, Dept Comp Sci, Calgary, AB, Canada","Imperial College London; University of Calgary","Reardon, J (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Comp Sci, Calgary, AB, Canada.","joel.reardon@ucalgary.ca","","","","","","","21","6","6","1","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-3669-1","","","","2019","","","","","","","60","72","","10.1109/CVCBT.2019.00006","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CVCBT.2019.00006","","","13","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO1JH","","Bronze","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000500473100008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Palladium is the largest net contributor of spillovers while Bitcoin is a net recipient. Finally, evidence of asymmetry in semi-volatility transmission shows that Bitcoin heavily transmits netpositive spillovers to other assets.

The Bitcoin network stores personal data by automated means. Furthermore, full nodes qualify as establishments and the network offers a service to citizens in the EU. The data processing within the Bitcoin network therefore falls into the material and territorial scope of the GDPR. To protect data subjects, the GDPR allocates responsibility to the controller, who determines the 'how' and the 'why' of the data processing. However, the distributed structure of the Bitcoin network blurs the lines between actors who are responsible and actors who are worth protecting. Neither the Bitcoin users running lightweight nodes or full nodes nor the miners determine the 'how' and the 'why' of the data processing. They carry out their network activities according to the Bitcoin protocol, which can only be adopted and enforced by a collective of full nodes and miners. Members of this collective are joint controllers under Article 26 GDPR, which obliges them to clearly and transparently determine their respective responsibilities for compliance with the GDPR. However, this mechanism fails because of the very structure it aims to eliminate. Therefore, a solution to allocating responsibility for data protection in distributed networks lies outside the GDPR.

To represent this complicated behavior, recent studies have emphasized the use of autoregressive models frequently concluding that generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models are the most adequate to overcome the limitations of conventional standard deviation estimates. Some studies have expanded this approach including jumps into the modeling. Following this line of research, and extending previous research, our study analyzes the volatility of Bitcoin employing and comparing some symmetric and asymmetric GARCH model extensions (threshold ARCH (TARCH), exponential GARCH (EGARCH), asymmetric power ARCH (APARCH), component GARCH (CGARCH), and asymmetric component GARCH (ACGARCH)), under two distributions (normal and generalized error). Additionally, because linear GARCH models can produce biased results if the series exhibit structural changes, once the conditional volatility has been modeled, we identify the best fitting GARCH model applying a Markov switching model to test whether Bitcoin volatility evolves according to two different regimes: high volatility and low volatility. The period of study includes daily series from July 16, 2010 (the earliest date available) to January 24, 2019. Findings reveal that EGARCH model under generalized error distribution provides the best fit to model Bitcoin conditional volatility. According to the Markov switching autoregressive (MS-AR) Bitcoin's conditional volatility displays two regimes: high volatility and low volatility.","[Sosa, Miriam] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Azcapotzalco, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Ortiz, Edgar; Cabello, Alejandra] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico","Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico","Sosa, M (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Azcapotzalco, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.","","Sosa, Miriam/GXZ-6750-2022","Sosa, Miriam/0000-0002-6597-5293","","","","","53","2","2","1","5","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND","1569-3767","","978-1-78973-381-5; 978-1-78973-382-2","INT FINANC REV","","","2019","20","","","","","","201","219","","10.1108/S1569-376720190000020020","http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/S1569-376720190000020020","","","19","Business; Business, Finance","Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH)","Business & Economics","BP0WS","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000537615900013","View Full Record in Web of Science"

By contrast, scant attention has been given to the intersection between the uses of Bitcoin and commercial law even as its popularity has grown as both an asset class and as a means of payment for goods and services. In determining the commercial law consequences of transactions involving Bitcoin, the likely cross-border nature of Bitcoin-related transactions will give rise to choice of law issues which may have a determinative effect on a given dispute. Commercial disputes involving virtual currencies have already made their way into common law courts. This paper examines one of the most significant choice of law problems that arises - the law applicable to determine disputes concerning property in Bitcoins (and determining the situs of Bitcoins) through the lens of English conflict of laws.","[Ng, Michael] Singapore Univ Social Sci, Sch Law, Singapore 599494, Singapore; [Ng, Michael] Astute Legal LLC, Singapore 409051, Singapore","Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS)","Ng, M (corresponding author), Singapore Univ Social Sci, Sch Law, Singapore 599494, Singapore.;Ng, M (corresponding author), Astute Legal LLC, Singapore 409051, Singapore.","michaelngmh@suss.edu.sg","","","","","","","34","6","6","0","6","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1744-1048","1757-8418","","J PRIV INT LAW","J.

In this paper, we investigate the cause and length of forks for the Bitcoin network. We develop theoretical formulas which model the Bitcoin consensus and network protocols, based on an Erdiis-Renyi random graph construction of the overlay network of peers. Our theoretical model addresses the effect of key parameters on the fork occurrence probability, such as block propagation delay, network bandwidth, and block size. We also leverage this model to estimate the weight of fork branches. Our model is implemented using the network simulator OMNET++, and validated by historical Bitcoin data. We show that under current conditions, Bitcoin will not benefit from increasing the number of connections per node.","[Shahsavari, Yahya; Zhang, Kaiwen; Talhi, Chamseddine] Univ Quebec, Dept Software & IT Engn, ETS, Montreal, PQ, Canada","University of Quebec; Ecole de Technologie Superieure - Canada; University of Quebec Montreal","Shahsavari, Y (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Dept Software & IT Engn, ETS, Montreal, PQ, Canada.","yahya.shahsavari.1@ens.etsmtl.ca; kaiwen.zhang@etsmtl.ca; chamseddine.talhi@etsmtl.ca","","","","","","","24","19","20","2","4","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-4693-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","237","244","","10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00038","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00038","","","8","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO8PX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000528931600029","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Regarding this deficiency, the purpose of this paper is to examine the dynamic connectedness between Bitcoin and equity market information. Design/methodology/approach Daily data from January 1, 2012 to May 31, 2018 are used. The paper applies a novel time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) model extended by Antonakakis and Gabauer (2017). This model addresses the biases in coefficient estimates, considering innovations from sources of time variation. Findings The findings reveal that the volatility transmission of Bitcoin return is not an important source of shocks of market returns in Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS), suggesting that Bitcoin return contributes less volatility to equity market information. The results further show that Bitcoin is the main receiver of volatility while market price risk is the dominant transmission catalysts for innovations in the rest of the stock market returns. Originality/value By acknowledging the wide range of econometric models, the paper uses TVP-VAR model because this methodology is a useful and relevant tool in modeling the volatility connectedness of financial variables, thus providing meaningful information to policy makers and international investors.","[Dahir, Ahmed Mohamed; Mahat, Fauziah] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Serdang, Malaysia; [Noordin, Bany-Ariffin Amin] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Accounting & Finance, Serdang, Malaysia; [Ab Razak, Nazrul Hisyam] Univ Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia","Universiti Putra Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia","Dahir, AM (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Serdang, Malaysia.","ahmedtall20@gmail.com","A.N., Bany-Ariffin/AAO-1400-2020","","","","","","41","14","14","2","7","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1743-9132","1758-6569","","INT J MANAG FINANC","Int.

THE CLASSIFICATION OF VIRTUAL CURRENCIES FOR TAX LAW","REVISTA DIREITO GV","","","Portuguese","Article","","","","","","Bitcoin; tax law; virtual coins; tax incidence","","The article analyzes the legal classification of virtual currencies, in order to define how taxation should be carried out over transactions with these currencies. To do so, the study begins looking at the concept of currency for the Brazilian legal system, in order to determine if it is feasible to classify virtual currencies as currency. To assist in this classification, a brief analysis of the treatment given by Comparative Law, in particular the European Union regulations, is carried out. The study of the European experience is especially interesting since the European Court of Justice has already had the opportunity to decide, in Case C-264/14 - Hedqvist, on the legal classification of bitcoin, determining whether it should be charged a value added tax (VAT) on bitcoin purchases and sales. Based on the European experience and on the Brazilian legal concept of currency, one concludes that it is possible to consider, for purposes of tax incidence, that financial transactions with virtual currencies are similar to operations with foreign currency. The present study focuses on the classification of bitcoin and congeners for tax law, not aiming to study the regulatory impacts that may arise from this classification.","[Castello, Melissa Guimaraes] Escola Super Propaganda Mkt Campus ESPM Sul, Curso Relacoes Int, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Castello, Melissa Guimaraes] Procuradoria Geral Estado Rio Grande Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil","","Castello, MG (corresponding author), Escola Super Propaganda Mkt Campus ESPM Sul, Curso Relacoes Int, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.;Castello, MG (corresponding author), Procuradoria Geral Estado Rio Grande Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.","melicastello@hotmail.com","","Castello, Melissa/0000-0002-0183-8564","","","","","26","0","0","2","13","FUNDACAO GETULIO VARGAS, ESCOLA DIREITO","SAO PAULO SP","RUA ROCHA, 23 11 ANDAR, SAO PAULO SP, 01330-0000, BRAZIL","1808-2432","2317-6172","","REV DIREITO GV","Rev.

This present study aimed at finding theoretical models at the macro- and microlevels that are able to explain the penetration and acceptance. Study 1 examined hypotheses on the predictive relationship between national cultural orientation and Bitcoin penetration involving 60 countries. Study 2, using a construal level perspective, tested the predictive strength of psychological distances against Bitcoin acceptance, involving 565 Indonesians (M-age = 28.88 years, SDage = 12.482 years). The results showed that national culture of individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation are able to predict the penetration. Spatial/physical distance, social distance, and hypothetical distance are able to predict the acceptance.

Both measures coincide in suggesting that the Bitcoin futures market dominates the price discovery process. We also find that both prices are driven by a common factor that is given by a weighted combination of the futures and spot market. Finally, we observe that deviations from the equilibrium condition equating the futures and spot log-price have predictive ability for the return on the Bitcoin spot price but not on the futures price.

This work updates and builds on a seminal paper, The Miner's Dilemma, which studied a simplified scenario and showed that a BWH attack can be rational behavior that is profitable for the attacker. The new research presented here provides an in-depth profit analysis of a more complex and realistic BWH attack scenario, which includes mutual attacks between multiple, non-uniform Bitcoin mining pools. As a result of mathematical analysis and MATLAB modeling, this paper illustrates the Nash equilibrium conditions of a system of independent mining pools with varied mining rates and computes the equilibrium rates of mutual BWH attack. The analysis method quantifies the additional profit the largest pools extract from the system at the expense of the smaller pools. The results indicate that while the presence of BWH is a net negative for smaller pools, they must participate in BWH to maximize their remaining profits, and the results quantify the attack rates the smaller pools must maintain. Also, the smallest pools maximize profit by not attacking at all that is, retaliation is not a rational move for them.","[Elliott, Sean] Southern Methodist Univ, Dallas, TX 75205 USA","Southern Methodist University","Elliott, S (corresponding author), Southern Methodist Univ, Dallas, TX 75205 USA.","sjelliott@smu.edu","","","","","","","29","4","4","1","4","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-2080-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","144","151","","10.1109/ICDIS.2019.00029","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDIS.2019.00029","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BQ4OP","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000591669600022","View Full Record in Web of Science"

At the moment of writing, the block reward is several orders of magnitude greater than the sum of transaction fees. Usually, miners try to collect the largest reward by including transactions associated with high fees. The main purpose of transaction fees is to prevent network spamming. However, they are also used to prioritize transactions. In order to use the minimum amount of fees, users usually have to find a compromise between fees and urgency of a transaction. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic logic model to experimentally analyze how fees affect confirmation time and miner's revenue and to predict if an increase of average fees will generate a situation when the miner gets more reward by not following the protocol.","[Azzolini, Damiano; Lamma, Evelina] Univ Ferrara, Dipartimento Ingn, Via Saragat 1, I-44122 Ferrara, Italy; [Riguzzi, Fabrizio] Univ Ferrara, Dipartimento Matemat & Informat, Via Saragat 1, I-44122 Ferrara, Italy","University of Ferrara; University of Ferrara","Azzolini, D (corresponding author), Univ Ferrara, Dipartimento Ingn, Via Saragat 1, I-44122 Ferrara, Italy.","damiano.azzolini@unife.it; fabrizio.riguzzi@unife.it; evelina.lamma@unife.it","Fabrizio, Riguzzi/C-7679-2012; Azzolini, Damiano/AAJ-8908-2020","Fabrizio, Riguzzi/0000-0003-1654-9703; Lamma, Evelina/0000-0003-2747-4292; Azzolini, Damiano/0000-0002-7133-2673","","","","","44","7","7","2","5","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2078-2489","","INFORMATION","Information","NOV","2019","10","11","","","","","","","335","10.3390/info10110335","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info10110335","","","18","Computer Science, Information Systems","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Computer Science","JU4CP","","gold, Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000501625300017","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Results from both conventional regression and vector autoregression (VAR) models show that the marginal cost of production plays an important role in explaining Bitcoin prices, challenging recent allegations that Bitcoins are essentially worthless. Even with markets pricing Bitcoin in the thousands of dollars each, the valuation model seems robust. The data show that a price bubble that began in the Fall of 2017 resolved itself in early 2018, converging with the marginal cost model. This suggests that while bubbles may appear in the Bitcoin market, prices will tend to this bound and not collapse to zero.","[Hayes, Adam S.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Sociol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hayes, Adam S.] Univ Nicosia, Msc Program Digital Currencies, Nicosia, Cyprus","University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Nicosia","Hayes, AS (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Sociol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.","ahayes8@wisc.edu","Hayes, Adam/GVS-6281-2022","Hayes, Adam/0000-0001-5481-8906","","","","","22","47","47","1","72","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1350-4851","1466-4291","","APPL ECON LETT","Appl.

The main aim of this paper is to examine interdependencies between log-returns of cryptocurrencies, with the special focus on Bitcoin. Based on implications from the literature, we use methods dedicated for studying the stock market and apply the two-step analysis, comparing results between two subsequent periods. Results obtained using Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) method show that cryptocurrencies form hierarchical clusters, consistently over two separate periods, indicating potential topological properties of the cryptocurrency market.

In Aug. 2017, Bitcoin was split into the original Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Since then, miners have had a choice between BTC and BCH mining because they have compatible proof-of-work algorithms. Therefore, they can freely choose which coin to mine for higher profit, where the profitability depends on both the coin price and mining difficulty. Some miners can immediately switch the coin to mine only when mining difficulty changes because the difficulty- changes are more predictable than that for the coin price, and we call this behavior fickle mining. In this paper, we study the effects of fickle mining by modeling a game between two coins. To do this, we consider both fickle miners and some factions (e.g., BITMAIN for BCH mining) that stick to mining one coin to maintain that chain. In this model, we show that fickle mining leads to a Nash equilibrium in which only a faction sticking to its coin mining remains as a loyal miner to the less valued coin (e.g., BCH), where loyal miners refer to those who conduct mining even after coin mining difficulty increases. This situation would cause severe centralization, weakening the security of the coin system. To determine which equilibrium the competing coin systems (e.g., BTC vs. BCH) are moving toward, we traced the historical changes of mining power for BTC and BCH and found that BCH often lacked loyal miners until Nov. 13, 2017, when the difficulty adjustment algorithm of BCH mining was changed. However, the change in difficulty adjustment algorithm of BCH mining led to a state close to the stable coexistence of BTC and BCH. We also demonstrate that the lack of BCH loyal miners may still be reached when a fraction of miners automatically and repeatedly switches to the most profitable coin to mine (i.e., automatic milling). According to our analysis, as of Dec. 2018, loyal miners to BCH would leave if more than about 5% of the total mining capacity for BTC and BCH has engaged in the automatic mining In addition, we analyze the recent hash war between Bitcoin ABC and SV, which confirms our theoretical analysis. Finally, we note that our results can be applied to any competing cryptocurrency systems in which the same hardware (e.g., ASICs or Gills) can be used for mining. Therefore, our study brings new and important angles in competitive coin markets: a coin can intentionally weaken the security and decentralization level of the other rival coin when mining hardware is shared between them, allowing for automatic mining.","[Kwon, Yujin; Shin, Jinwoo; Kim, Yongdae] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Daejeon, South Korea; [Kim, Hyoungshick] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, South Korea","Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)","Kwon, Y (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Daejeon, South Korea.","dbwls8724@kaist.ac.kr; hyoung@skku.edu; jinwoos@kaist.ac.kr; yongdaek@kaist.ac.kr","Patel, Ferhan/AAS-5533-2021","","","","","","52","16","16","1","5","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","1081-6011","","978-1-5386-6660-9","P IEEE S SECUR PRIV","","","2019","","","","","","","935","951","","10.1109/SP.2019.00075","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SP.2019.00075","","","17","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BO3ED","","Green Submitted, Bronze","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000510006100056","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Findings It is shown by the empirical results that different patterns of the day-of-the-week effects are observed on Bitcoin denominated in various fiat currencies by referring to the price data collected from exchanges. Furthermore, the patterns of the day-of-the-week effects are also available after adjusting Bitcoin prices denominated in domestic currencies into USD. Research limitations/implications - Because of the discontinuity of data for some daily return series, estimation with dynamic variance is not applicable. It is assumed that the error item follows normal distribution with constant variance. Originality/value The day-of-the-week effects are wide-spread in Bitcoin markets, and they are not mainly caused by movements of foreign exchange rates.

The discussion comprises its use as a speculative or safe haven asset, while other authors argue that the augmented attractiveness could end up accomplishing money's properties that economic theory demands. This paper explores the association between Bitcoin's market price and a set of internal and external factors by employing the Bayesian structural time series approach (BSTS). The idea behind BSTS is to create a superposition of layers such as cycles, trend, and explanatory variables that are allowed to vary stochastically over time, additionally, it is possible to perform a variable selection through the application of the Spike and Slab method. This study aims to contribute to the discussion of Bitcoin price determinants by differentiating among several attractiveness sources and employing a method that provides a more flexible analytic framework that decomposes each of the components of the time series, applies variable selection, includes information on previous studies, and dynamically examines the behavior of the explanatory variables, all in a transparent and tractable setting. The results show that the Bitcoin's price is negatively associated with the price of gold as well as the exchange rate between Yuan and US Dollar, while positively correlated to stock market index, USD to Euro exchange rate and diverse signs among the different countries' search trends.","[Poyser, Obryan] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain","Autonomous University of Barcelona","Poyser, O (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.","obryan.poyser@uab.cat","","Poyser, Obryan/0000-0003-3109-7119","","","","","56","38","38","0","13","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","1309-422X","2147-429X","","EURASIAN ECON REV","Eurasian Econ.

On the Bitcoin Blockchain, an owning entity's real-world identity is hidden behind a pseudonym, a so-called address. Therefore, Bitcoin is widely assumed to provide a high degree of anonymity, which is a driver for its frequent use for illicit activities. This paper presents a novel approach for de-anonymizing the Bitcoin Blockchain by using Supervised Machine Learning to predict the type of yet-unidentified entities. We utilized a sample of 957 entities (with approximate to 385 million transactions), whose identity and type had been revealed, as training set data and built classifiers differentiating among 12 categories. Our main finding is that we can indeed predict the type of a yet-unidentified entity. Using the Gradient Boosting algorithm with default parameters, we achieve a mean cross-validation accuracy of 80.42% and F1-score of approximate to 79.64%.

To accomplish these goals, a complex method consisting of single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) is used.

We identify several human actors, such as miners, developers, merchants, and investors, as well as non-human actors, including blockchain, exchanges, hardware manufacturers, and wallets, involved in Bitcoin splits. Our results show that the consolidation of actors in homogeneous groups plays a key role in blockchain splits. We further describe how the human and non-human actors' fluid moves into micro and macro actor positions in the network affect the development of the split.

In this paper, we employ a battery of statistical tests-VECM, Granger Causality, ARMA, ARDL and Wavelet Coherence-to identify price leadership between the two crypto heavyweights Bitcoin and Ethereum. Based on one year hourly and daily data from August 2017 through to September 2018, our tests yield varied results but largely suggest bi-directional causality between the two assets.

Based on the 5-minute return of Bitcoin, the proxy of its true volatility is computed as the sum of the squared intraday returns. To evaluate the performance of volatility modeling, this paper relies on MSE and QLIKE, which are the measures for making the forecast accuracy robust to noise in the imperfect volatility proxy, while different measures are also used for the robustness check. The empirically findings summarized as (1) the asymmetric volatility models such as EGARCH and APARCH have a higher predictability, and (2) the volatility model with normal distribution performs better than the fat-tailed distribution such as skewed t distribution.","[Hattori, Takahiro] Minist Finance, Policy Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan","","Hattori, T (corresponding author), Minist Finance, Policy Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan.","hattori0819@gmail.com","","","","","","","16","4","4","0","7","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1350-4851","1466-4291","","APPL ECON LETT","Appl.

In three cases, which occurred between 2013 and 2015, we examine this system at moments of breakdown. In contrast to the discourse, we find that power is concentrated to critical sites and individuals who manage the system through ad hoc negotiations, and who users must therefore implicitly trust-a contrast we call Bitcoin's promissory gap. But even in the face of such contradictions between premise and reality, the discourse is maintained. We identify four authorizing strategies used in this work: conflating people with devices, assuming actors conform to notions of economic rationality, appealing to technical expertise, and explaining contradictions as temporary bugs. We contend that these strategies are mobilized widely to legitimize a variety of applications of algorithmic regulation and peer production projects.","[Vidan, Gili] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lehdonvirta, Vili] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford, England","Harvard University; University of Oxford","Vidan, G (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Ctr Sci, 1 Oxford St,Room 371, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.","gvidan@g.harvard.edu","","Vidan, Gili/0000-0002-1855-4779","","","","","49","22","22","1","31","SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD","LONDON","1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","1461-4448","1461-7315","","NEW MEDIA SOC","New Media Soc.","JAN","2019","21","1","","","","","42","59","","10.1177/1461444818786220","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1461444818786220","","","18","Communication","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Communication","HG1MR","","Green Submitted, Bronze","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000454721400003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach This paper explores the return and volatility transmission between the Bitcoin, as the largest cryptocurrency, and other traditional asset classes, namely stock, bond and currencies from the standpoint of Turkey over the period July, 2010-June, 2018 using the newly developed multivariate econometric technique, VAR-GARCH, in mean framework with the BEKK representation. Findings The empirical results reveal the existence of the positive unilateral return spillovers from the bond market to Bitcoin market. Regarding the results of shock and volatility spillovers, there exists strong evidence of bidirectional cross-market shock and volatility spillover effects between Bitcoin and all other financial asset classes, except US Dollar exchange rate. Originality/value The important extention is the adoption of a newly developed multivariate econometric technique, VAR-GARCH, in mean framework with the BEKK representation, proposed by Engle and Kroner (1995), which is employed for the first time specifically to examine the extent of integration in terms of volatility and return between Bitcoin and key asset classes. Second, Bitcoin has experienced a rapid growth since around a decade and a number of investors are showing interest in its potential as an integrative part of portfolio diversification. The information provided by empirical results gives empirical bases from which to address topics concerning hedging purposes and optimal portfolio allocation. It is also increasingly important to analyze the current behavior of Bitcoin in relation to other assets to provide policy makers and regulatory bodies with guidance on the role of the Bitcoin as an investment asset in Turkey. Thus, this is the first serious attempt at exploring the potential for Bitcoin to offer diversification opportunities in the context of Turkey.","[Vardar, Gulin; Aydogan, Berna] Izmir Univ Econ, Balcova, Turkey","Izmir Ekonomi Universitesi","Aydogan, B (corresponding author), Izmir Univ Econ, Balcova, Turkey.","berna.okan@ieu.edu.tr","","","","","","","56","7","7","2","27","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1450-2194","1758-888X","","EUROMED J BUS","EuroMed J.

We consider multi-input multi-output transactions with at least two inputs and three outputs as proxy, to analyze four characteristic periods of similar to 50 days each, representing periods before the introduction of mixing, in its early days, during its growth, and after the volume of such multi-input multi-output transactions became more or less stabile. Structural properties and characteristics of the transaction and wallet address networks are computed and compared, through standard tools, but also via the introduction of two novel techniques that provide indicators of mixing-like behaviors: (1) an entropy characterization to detect abnormally uniform inputs and/or outputs and (2) a connected component analysis of subgraphs formed by only multi-input multi-output transactions (showing cascades of such transactions). The contributions of this exploratory Bitcoin network analysis paper can thus be seen as two-fold.

Until reaching consensus, PoW-valid blocks (including validated transactions and proper PoW solutions) can be viewed as being successfully mined and are rewarded. There are two types of rewards for miners: fixed block subsidies and time-varying transaction fees. Block subsidies, predetermined by design, are the current major revenue source. Transaction fees, offered by Bitcoin transaction senders to accelerate their transactions, heavily depend on the corresponding transaction size. Thus, a larger-size block tends to contain higher transaction fees and hence more rewards. However, the probability of a miner to successfully mine a block diminishes as the block size increases, since a larger-size block takes a longer time to reach consensus. Thus, the reward included in the block is vitally affected by its size, which is independently decided by a miner. In this paper, we use a game-theoretic approach to study how a miner's payoff, i.e., expected profits, is determined by his block size. More specifically, we derive an expression to characterize the relation between the miner's payoff and block sizes. Besides, we use game theory to analyze how profit-driven miners will manipulate their block sizes to optimize payoff instead of adopting the default block size. We conduct numerical experiments on real-world data collected from Bitcoin to find peaceful equilibrium where miners have no incentive to misbehave. The achieved block sizes thereby give guidelines on the default block size, in order to deter miners from misbehaving. Our analysis suggests a block size of 4 MB.","[Jiang, Suhan; Wu, Jie] Temple Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University","Jiang, S (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.","Suhan.Jiang@temple.edu; jiewu@temple.edu","","","NSF [CNS 1824440, CNS 1828363, CNS 1757533, CNS 1629746, CNS-1651947, CNS 1564128]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was supported in part by NSF grants CNS 1824440, CNS 1828363, CNS 1757533, CNS 1629746, CNS-1651947, and CNS 1564128.","","23","7","7","2","4","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-4693-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","107","115","","10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00023","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00023","","","9","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO8PX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000528931600014","View Full Record in Web of Science"

To make risk management strategies, emphasis on cryptocurrency price predicting is truly needy. However, studies about cryptocurrency prediction are lacking. In this paper, a novel hybrid model combining long short-term memory (LSTM), a state-of-the-art sequence learning method, with singular spectrum analysis (SSA) was proposed to predict Bitcoin price. SSA was employed to decompose the original time series into independent signals in term of trend, market fluctuation and noise. A smoothed series with valid information was reconstructed with reduction of noise. By introducing the smoothed series sequence into LSTM, prediction value is obtained. Empirical analysis shows that the proposed hybrid SSA-LSTM model outperforms baseline single LSTM model, according to root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The result suggests that the proposed hybrid model has satisfactory ability to grasp pattern of Bitcoin price series since SSA can extract valid information from the original series and avoid overfitting.","[Qiao, Zhaoying; Dai, Shuning] Nanjing Univ Chinese Med, Coll Hlth Econ & Management, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Chai, Tianrui] Beihang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gu, Jialu] Univ New South Wales, Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Zhou, Xinyi] Nanjing Univ Post & Telecommun, Coll Commun & Informat Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xuanming] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine; Beihang University; University of New South Wales Sydney; Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Australian National University","Qiao, ZY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Chinese Med, Coll Hlth Econ & Management, Nanjing, Peoples R China.","zhaoyingqiao1996@yahoo.com; trchai@buaa.edu.cn; z5232132@ad.unsw.edu.au; B15010405@njupt.edu.cn; d19971014@126.com; u5873310@anu.edu.au","","","","","","","15","0","0","2","5","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-3299-0","","","","2019","","","","","","","53","57","","","","","","5","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS0HG","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000682781500013","View Full Record in Web of Science"

While Bitcoin has inherent security mechanism to prevent double-spending attacks, it requires a certain amount of time to detect the double-spending attacks after the transaction has been initiated. Therefore, it is impractical to protect the payees from suffering in double-spending attacks in fast payment scenarios where the time between the exchange of currency and goods or services is shorten to few seconds. Although we cannot prevent double-spending attacks immediately for fast payments, decentralized non-equivocation contracts have been proposed to penalize the malicious payer after the attacks have been detected. The basic idea of these contracts is that the payer locks some coins in a deposit when he initiates a transaction with the payee. If the payer double-spends, a cryptographic primitive called accountable assertions can be used to reveal his Bitcoin credentials for the deposit. Thus, the malicious payer could be penalized by the loss of deposit coins. However, such decentralized non-equivocation contracts are subjected to collusion attacks where the payer colludes with the beneficiary of the depoist and transfers the Bitcoin deposit back to himself when he double-spends, resulting in no penalties. On the other hand, even if the beneficiary behaves honestly, the victim payee cannot get any compensation directly from the deposit in the original design. To prevent such collusion attacks, we design fair time-locked deposits for Bitcoin transactions to defend against double-spending. The fair deposits ensure that the payer will be penalized by the loss of his deposit coins if he double-spends and the victim payee's loss will be compensated within a locked time period. We start with the protocols of making a deposit for one transaction. In particular, for the transaction with single input and output and the transaction with multiple inputs and outputs, we provide different designs of the deposits. We analyze the performance of deposits made for one transaction and show how the fair deposits work efficiently in Bitcoin. We also provide protocols of making a deposit for multiple transactions, which can reduce the burdens of a honest payer. In the end, we extend the fair deposits to non-equivocation contracts for other distributed systems.","[Yu, Xingjie; Thang, Michael Shiwen; Li, Yingjiu; Deng, Robert Huijie] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Informat Syst, Singapore, Singapore","Singapore Management University","Yu, XJ (corresponding author), Singapore Management Univ, Sch Informat Syst, Singapore, Singapore.","stefanie_yxj@hotmail.com; swthang.2015@mais.smu.edu.sg; yjli@smu.edu.sg; robertdeng@smu.edu.sg","","Deng, Robert/0000-0003-3491-8146","Singapore National Research Foundation under NCR [NRF2015NCR-NCR003-002]","Singapore National Research Foundation under NCR(National Research Foundation, Singapore)","This work was supported by the Singapore National Research Foundation under NCR Award Number NRF2015NCR-NCR003-002.

Using both time and frequency domain mechanisms, we provide estimates of outward and inward spillover effects. These have implications for (weak-form) cross-market inefficiency. In our setting, we treat high-degree of spillover as an indicator of weak-form inefficiency because investors can utilise information on the dynamic spillover effects to produce a best long-run prediction of the market. Our results show that Bitcoin prices depict strong (dynamic) spillover in volatility, especially during episodes of high uncertainty. The Bitcoin-USD exchange rate possesses net predictive power, mirrored by the tendency of the Bitcoin-EURO market as a net receiver relative to other markets. Robustness exercise generally supports our claim.

Over the last decade, more than 1,000 different cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin were developed and Bitcoin's currency had almost reached an equivalent value of 20,000 $/BTC. After recognizing the disrupting momentum that the blockchain technology generated, scientists started to develop blockchain use cases for the energy sector. However, the scientific literature so far offers only rough and incomplete estimations when questions about the current and future energy consumption of the Bitcoin network are raised. This paper introduces a new scenario model to estimate the mining power demand of the Bitcoin and Ethereum network. Six scenarios are developed on the basis of mining hardware efficiency and network parameter data. The results show that an increase of the mining hardware efficiency will only have a limited impact on the overall power demand of blockchain networks. Furthermore, the current power demand of the Ethereum network is in the range from 0.6 to 3 GW and therefore, is similar to the one of Bitcoin. In case of linear growth of the block difficulty and sigmoidal increase of the hardware efficiency until the year of 2025, the mining power demand for the Bitcoin blockchain will be approximately 8 GW. Furthermore, the model and the scenarios are adaptable to other cryptocurrencies that use the proof-of-work consensus algorithm to create scenarios for their future power demand.","[Zade, Michel; Myklebost, Jonas; Tzscheutschler, Peter; Wagner, Ulrich] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Chair Energy Econ & Applicat Technol, Munich, Germany","Technical University of Munich","Zade, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Chair Energy Econ & Applicat Technol, Munich, Germany.","michel.zade@tum.de","","Zade, Michel/0000-0002-4949-9960","","","","","34","10","10","2","20","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","2296-598X","","","FRONT ENERGY RES","Front.

In this paper, we focus on identifying user activities on smartphone-based Bitcoin wallet apps that are commonly used for sending, receiving, and trading Bitcoin. To accomplish our goal, we performed network traffic analysis using machine learning techniques. Since we focus on apps of the same type/functionality, it makes our classification problem even more difficult compared to classifying apps tailored for discrete purposes. Moreover, our goal is to identify user activities even in the presence of encryption. In our experiments, we considered the worldwide most downloaded Bitcoin wallet apps on both Google Play Store and Apple's App Store. For collecting network traffic traces, we used only physical hardware and omitted any emulator to build our experiment scenario as close to the real environment as possible. We process the traffic traces in several phases before extracting the features that are utilized to train our supervised learning algorithms. We deal with the classification problem in multiple stages in a hierarchical fashion. We ran a thorough set of experiments to assess the performance of our system and attained nearly 95% accuracy in user activity identification.","[Aiolli, Fabio; Conti, Mauro; Gangwal, Ankit; Polato, Mirko] Univ Padua, Dept Math, I-35121 Padua, Italy","University of Padua","Gangwal, A (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Math, I-35121 Padua, Italy.","aiolli@math.unipd.it; conti@math.unipd.it; ankit.gangwal@phd.unipd.it; mpolato@math.unipd.it","Conti, Mauro/F-9145-2012; Gangwal, Ankit/M-3965-2017; Polato, Mirko/GSO-3343-2022","Conti, Mauro/0000-0002-3612-1934; Gangwal, Ankit/0000-0002-8065-3700; Polato, Mirko/0000-0003-4890-5020","Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Padova e Rovigo (CARIPARO); EU TagItSmart!

At present, there is already much work around the stock price prediction using news articles, but there are few papers on the cryptocurrency market. In this paper, we aim to research the effects of news articles on bitcoin prices. We extract features from news articles with both commonly used text feature extraction algorithms (e.g., N-Gram and TF-IDF) and SentiGraph, which is a novel text representation method we propose. SentiGraph takes advantages of sentiment analysis and transforms a news article into a graph. Compared with previous feature extraction methods, our experiment results show that this new approach is superior on the prediction accuracy, which also demonstrates the impacts of news articles on the bitcoin price.","[Yao, Wenbing] Tsinghua Univ, Grad Sch Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Xu, Ke] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Ke] Beijing Natl Res Ctr Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Qi] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Network Sci & Cyberspace, Beijing, Peoples R China","Tsinghua University; University Town of Shenzhen; Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School; Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University","Li, Q (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Inst Network Sci & Cyberspace, Beijing, Peoples R China.","ywb16@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; xuke@tsinghua.edu.cn; qi.li@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn","","","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFB0803405]; National Natural Foundation of China [61825204, 61572278, U1736209]; Beijing Outstanding Young Scientist Project","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Outstanding Young Scientist Project","This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2018YFB0803405, the National Natural Foundation of China under Grants 61825204, 61572278, and U1736209, and Beijing Outstanding Young Scientist Project.","","21","0","0","0","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1530-1346","","978-1-7281-2999-0","IEEE SYMP COMP COMMU","","","2019","","","","","","","118","123","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BP9AI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000568621700026","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It is of great importance for investors and regulators to recognize whether there are market manipulation and its manipulation patterns. This paper proposes an approach to mine the transaction networks of exchanges for answering this question. By taking the leaked transaction history of Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange as a sample, we first divide the accounts into three categories according to its characteristic and then construct the transaction history into three graphs. Many observations and findings are obtained via analyzing the constructed graphs. To evaluate the influence of the accounts' transaction behavior on the Bitcoin exchange price, the graphs are reconstructed into series and reshaped as matrices. By using singular value decomposition (SVD) on the matrices, we identify many base networks which have a great correlation with the price fluctuation. When further analyzing the most important accounts in the base networks, plenty of market manipulation patterns are found. According to these findings, we conclude that there was serious market manipulation in Mt. Gox exchange and the cryptocurrency market must strengthen the supervision.","[Zheng, Zibin; Chen, Chuan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; Sun Yat Sen Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Digital Life, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University","Zheng, ZB; Chen, C (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.","chenwli9@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; wujun53@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; zhzibin@mail.sysu.edu.cn; chenchuan@mail.sysu.edu.cn; zhouyuren@mail.sysu.edu.cn","Zheng, Zibin/E-3024-2014; Zheng, Zibin/HCH-2408-2022","Zheng, Zibin/0000-0002-7878-4330; Zheng, Zibin/0000-0002-7878-4330","National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFB1000101]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61722214,11801595]; Pearl River S&T Nova Program of Guangzhou [201710010046]; Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams [2016ZT06D211]","National Key Research and Development Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Pearl River S&T Nova Program of Guangzhou; Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams","The work described in this paper was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program (2016YFB1000101),the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61722214,11801595), the Pearl River S&T Nova Program of Guangzhou (201710010046) and the Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams (2016ZT06D211).","","25","45","47","1","15","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","0743-166X","","978-1-7281-0515-4","IEEE INFOCOM SER","","","2019","","","","","","","964","972","","","","","","9","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BN3NZ","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000480426400108","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Outcomes confirm that market attention has an impact on Bitcoin returns and volatility, when measured by applying several transformations on time series for the trading volume or the SVI Google searches index. Specifically, best candidate models are selected via the so-called Box-Jenkins methodology and by maximizing out-of-sample forecasting performance. Overall, we can conclude that trading volume-related measures affect both the mean and the volatility of the cryptocurrency returns, while Internet searches volume mainly affects the volatility. An interesting side finding is that the inclusion of attention measures in model specification makes forecast estimates more accurate.","[Figa-Talamanca, Gianna; Patacca, Marco] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via A Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy; [Patacca, Marco] Leonard de Vinci Pole Univ, Res Ctr, F-92916 Paris, France","University of Perugia","Figa-Talamanca, G (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via A Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.","gianna.figatalamanca@unipg.it; marco.patacca@devinci.fr","Patacca, Marco/AAF-2059-2019; Figa-Talamanca, Gianna/AAH-8196-2021","Patacca, Marco/0000-0003-3242-429X; ","Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio Perugia [2015.0459.013]","Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio Perugia(Fondazione Cassa Risparmio Perugia)","This research was funded by Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio Perugia, grant n. 2015.0459.013 and partially carried out during the stay of the authors at the Department of Finance and Risk Engineering, Tandon School of Engineering, New York University.

Focusing on Bitcoin, we argue that an effective anti-state market device needs to be durably 'counterearmarked', to use Viviana Zelizer's term, with radical meaning. This durability, however, requires that the movement build alliances with holders of political and economic power who also embrace the device's radical meaning, lest those actors reformat the device to suit their purposes. To make this case, we locate Bitcoin's radical origins in a performative project built on elements of Austrian monetary theory. We then track Bitcoin's dual transformation between 2009 and 2014: the anti-state movement gave way to a market featuring big financial players, and the Internal Revenue Service officially redefined the bitcoin currency as property. Understanding this dual transformation requires joining Zelizerian conceptions of money with theories of markets-and-movements on the one hand, and symbolic-cultural conceptions of the classificatory state on the other.","[Lawrence, Christopher J.; Mudge, Stephanie Lee] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Sociol, 1283 Social Sci & Humanities, Davis, CA 95616 USA","University of California System; University of California Davis","Lawrence, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Sociol, 1283 Social Sci & Humanities, Davis, CA 95616 USA.","cjlaw@ucdavis.edu","","","","","","","64","4","5","2","12","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1475-1461","1475-147X","","SOCIO-ECON REV","Socio-Econ.

Our findings have revealed objective prerequisites for creating cryptocurrency as an innovative means of information-based payment. Cryptocurrency poses a challenge to the financial system of Ukraine since both the central bank and other state regulators can not control its emission and circulation. They show the growth dynamics in cryptocurrency market capitalization where Bitcoin predominates. Although cryptocurrency is not included in the National Register of payment systems and it is officially prohibited for circulation in Ukraine, our country ranks among the world's top five countries by number of users of different bitcoin-wallets. We have examined the strengths of Bitcoin that have made this cryptocurrency a convenient means of international payment with a high investment potential. The results show disadvantages to using cryptocurrency for both the whole country in general and ordinary consumers in particular. We have defined main threats that national governments can face in case of an unregulated spread of cryptocurrency. Also this study, based on the works of leading foreign scientists and financial market experts, systematizes factors that influence the price of Bitcoin. It substantiates opportunities and prospects for the cryptocurrency market development in Ukraine. The study has shown that cryptocurrencies have their own niche in payment systems; they are quite competitive and reliable financial instruments. The growth dynamics of cryptocurrency market capitalization in the world makes Bitcoin the most successful example of the use of virtual currency in the information economy.

Instead of generating randomly pairs of keys, which may need higher space complexity for key management, hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets derive all the keys from a single seed, which is sufficient to recover all the keys, to reduce the complexity of key management. In an HD wallet, it allows users to generate child public keys from the parent public keys without knowing any of the corresponding private keys. This feature allows a permitted auditor to derive all the public keys for auditing. However, this feature makes HD wallets suffered from so-called privilege escalation attacks, where the leakage of any child private key along with its parent public key will expose the other child private keys. To confront with this security flaw, we propose a novel HD wallet scheme that gives out a signature with trapdoor hash functions instead of directly giving private keys for signing. Since it conceals private keys from any child nodes, it can prevent from privilege escalation attacks. Nevertheless, the proposed scheme also provides unlinkability between two public keys to achieve anonymity of user identities and high scalability to the derivations of huge amount of keys. Thus, the proposed scheme achieves user anonymity, public key derivation, and high scalability.","[Fan, Chun-I; Su, Hui-Po; Hsu, Ruei-Hau] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Tseng, Yi-Fan] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Taipei 11605, Taiwan; [Kikuchi, Hiroaki] Meiji Univ, Dept Frontier Media Sci, Tokyo 1648525, Japan","National Sun Yat Sen University; National Chengchi University; Meiji University","Fan, CI (corresponding author), Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.","cifan@mail.cse.nsysu.edu.tw; yftseng1989@gmail.com; rhhsu@mail.cse.nsysu.edu.tw; kikn@meiji.ac.jp","","Fan, Chun-I/0000-0002-7512-1291","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST 105-2923-E-110-001-MY3, MOST 107-2218-E-110-014]","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This study was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST 105-2923-E-110-001-MY3, MOST 107-2218-E-110-014).","","22","4","5","0","7","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1615-5262","1615-5270","","INT J INF SECUR","Int.

Data mining keeps a record of the various payments made and the services used in an organized form. Since mining is the bedrock of bitcoin framework, it is very important to make sure that the mined data is unalterable and complete by repeatedly verifying and adding new transactions. For this purpose, we use various algorithms and protocols, along with satisfying proof-of-stake and proof-of-work.

However, the previous articles mainly focused on the security of single offline transaction. In multiple offline bitcoin transactions, users deposit a small amount of bitcoins in advance into the wallet several times. For each deposit, the offline wallet has to generate a new pair of public and private keys and store it, which impose a heavy storage burden on the offline wallets and lower the efficiency of the transaction. Besides, a malicious attacker is able to embed a Secretly Embedded Trapdoor with Universal Protection (SETUP) into the offline wallet by infecting the user's storage device, hence he can launch the kleptographic attack to get user's private keys. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient Bitcoin payments in multiple offline transactions. Our scheme relies on the master public key property of the hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet to generate the key pairs of our offline wallet (MOBT). At the same time, an interactive signature protocol is used to protect MOBT from the kleptographic attack during the offline payments. We demonstrate the security of MOBT wallet and analyze the wallet's capability to resist the kleptographic attack. The results show that the MOBT wallet is secure even if m - 1 child private keys are leaked out. Furthermore, users can store their bitcoins in the wallet once. It only requires a half of the original storage volume under multiple offline bitcoin transaction. Finally, we compare the current mainstream wallets features on the market. We also discuss a novel approach for double-spending attack under offline probability payments. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Increasing volume of Bitcoin transactions makes it impractical for each user to store a full copy of whole ledger, especially for a normal user who makes few transactions and owns constrained storage space. There are already some works conducted to reduce the storage overhead by redesigning the system protocol, based on different trust assumptions. An example is running light nodes, which trust the full nodes to store its relevant data and reply to its data request timely. However, it introduces the risks of permanent data loss, as the data relevant to a light node may be tailored by all the full nodes later. Another attempt is conducted by organizing the nodes into several cooperative units based on a trust assumption, which is hard to satisfy in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel Jigsaw-like Data Reduction (Jidar) approach. Each node in Jidar only stores transactions of interest and relevant Merkle branches from the complete blocks, just like selecting several pieces from the jigsaw puzzles. A node can maintain and verify all its relevant data locally and safely without any trust assumptions. To verify the validity of a newly proposed transaction, Merkle branches relevant to the inputs are provided along with the transaction by the proposer. In view of the requirement that a user wants to cohere all the fragments stored in different nodes into a complete block, just like stitching all the pieces into a complete jigsaw-puzzle picture, a mechanism to query full data is added to Jidar. Experimental results demonstrate that Jidar can reduce a normal node's storage cost to about 1.03% of the original Bitcoin system at a low communication cost.","[Dai, Xiaohai; Xiao, Jiang; Yang, Wenhui; Wang, Chaofan; Jin, Hai] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Natl Engn Res Ctr Big Data Technol & Syst, Serv Comp Technol & Syst Lab,Cluster & Grid Comp, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China","Huazhong University of Science & Technology","Xiao, J (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Natl Engn Res Ctr Big Data Technol & Syst, Serv Comp Technol & Syst Lab,Cluster & Grid Comp, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.","jiangxiao@hust.edu.cn","","","National Science Foundation of China [61702203]; Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation [2018CFB133]","National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation","This work is supported by National Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61702203, Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation No. 2018CFB133.

Multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-DCCA), multivariate GARCH (MVGARCH) and information share (IS) analysis are utilized to achieve this purpose. The empirical results show that, firstly the MF-DCCA suggests that obvious multifractality exists in the cross-correlations among the three hedging assets and Bitcoin is more susceptible to price fluctuations from gold and crude oil markets. Secondly the results from DCC-MVGARCH model indicate that, although significant volatility spillovers are detected among the three assets, the spillover effects from gold and crude oil markets to Bitcoin market are much stronger than other spillovers. Additionally, the dynamic correlations between gold and crude oil markets are almost positive, while those between Bitcoin and gold, and those between Bitcoin and oil markets are nearly negative during the whole sample periods.

Design/methodology/approach The paper used a risk analysis named as VaR. The analysis has various computations that Historical Simulation and Monte Carlo Simulation methods were used for this paper. Findings Findings of the analysis are assessed in two different aspects of singular currency risk and portfolios built. First, BTC is found to be significantly risky with respect to the major currencies; and it is six times riskier than the singular most risky currency. Second, in terms of inclusion of BTC into a portfolio, which equally weights all currencies, it elevates overall portfolio risk by 98 per cent. Practical implications - In spite of the remarkable risk level, it could be considered that investors are desirous of making an investment on BTC could mitigate their overall exposed risk relatively by building a portfolio. Originality/value The paper questions the risk level of Bitcoin, which is a digital currency. BTC, a matter of debate in the contemporary period, is seen as a digital currency free from control or supervision of a regulatory board. With the comparison of major currencies and BTC shows that how could be risky of a financial instrument without regulations.

To obtain a quantitative estimate of the malicious activity that Bitcoin is associated with, we collected over 2.3 million candidate Bitcoin addresses, harvested from the dark web between June 2016 and December 2017. The Bitcoin addresses found on the dark web were labeled with tags that classified the activities associated with the onions that these addresses were collected from. The tags covered a wide range of activities, from suspicious to outright malicious or illegal. Of these addresses, only 47,697 have tags we consider indicative of suspicious or malicious activities. We saw a clear decline in the monthly number of Bitcoin addresses seen on the dark web in the periods coinciding with takedowns of known dark web markets. We also found interesting behavior that distinguishes the Bitcoin addresses collected from the dark web when compared to activity of a random address on the Bitcoin blockchain. For example, we found that Bitcoin addresses used on the dark web are more likely to be involved in mixing transactions. To identify mixing transactions, we developed a new heuristic that extends previously known ones.

Here, we demonstrate a methodology for estimating the power consumption associated with Bitcoin's blockchain based on IPO filings of major hardware manufacturers, insights on mining facility operations, and mining pool compositions. We then translate our power consumption estimate into carbon emissions, using the localization of IP addresses. We determine the annual electricity consumption of Bitcoin, as of November 2018, to be 45.8 TWh and estimate that annual carbon emissions range from 22.0 to 22.9 MtCO(2). This means that the emissions produced by Bitcoin sit between the levels produced by the nations of Jordan and Sri Lanka, which is comparable to the level of Kansas City. With this article, we aim to gauge the external costs of Bitcoin and inform the broader debate on the costs and benefits of cryptocurrencies.","[Stoll, Christian] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Energy Markets, TUM Sch Management, Munich, Germany; [Stoll, Christian] MIT, MIT Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Klaassen, Lena] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, Munich, Germany; [Gallersdoerfer, Ulrich] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Informat, Software Engn Business Informat Syst, Munich, Germany","Technical University of Munich; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich","Stoll, C (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Energy Markets, TUM Sch Management, Munich, Germany.;Stoll, C (corresponding author), MIT, MIT Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.","cstoll@mit.edu","Stoll, Christian/AAX-8868-2021","Stoll, Christian/0000-0001-5169-029X; Klaassen, Lena/0000-0003-0360-4603","","","","","32","112","112","19","69","CELL PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA","2542-4351","","","JOULE","Joule","JUL 17","2019","3","7","","","","","1647","1661","","10.1016/j.joule.2019.05.012","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2019.05.012","","","15","Chemistry, Physical; Energy & Fuels; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Chemistry; Energy & Fuels; Materials Science","IK3CI","","Bronze","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000476463300009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The market microstructure for bitcoins is highly developed in terms of information generation and transfer. Therefore, returns volatility is highly likely to be affected by market information availability. We analyze the relationship between returns volatility and two independent variables, user opinion difference and user interest. This study adopted the GJR-GARCH model, appropriate for volatility studies. First, we find that, for volatility asymmetry, the Bitcoin market exhibits greater market efficiency than the general financial market. Also, the persistence of volatility is greater. The Bitcoin market is still relatively unregulated; hence, studying the relationship between information asymmetry and regulation in the market is salient. Moreover, we can infer that the ratio of reasonable users is high in the Bitcoin market. Second, the Bitcoin market supports the sequential information arrival hypothesis in that day trading volume, which is a proxy for user differences of opinion, has a statistically significant effect on returns volatility. Third, for the proxies of user interest, namely, the growth rate of page views on Google Trends and Wikipedia, only the growth rate of Google Trends shows statistically significant effects on Bitcoin returns volatility. This study can provide useful information to the financial market and policy makers on the behavior of the Bitcoin market, which may help to lower future entry barriers and opportunity costs of the Bitcoin market.","[Yu, Ju Hyun; Kang, Juyoung; Park, Sangun] Ajou Univ, Suwon 16499, South Korea","Ajou University","Kang, J (corresponding author), Ajou Univ, Suwon 16499, South Korea.","jykang@ajou.ac.kr","","","MSIT(Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC(Information Technology Research Center) support program [2018-0-01424]","MSIT(Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC(Information Technology Research Center) support program","This research was supported by the MSIT(Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC(Information Technology Research Center) support program(2018-0-01424) supervised by the IITP(Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion).","","64","26","26","2","39","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0306-4573","1873-5371","","INFORM PROCESS MANAG","Inf.

In the DLCC blockchain, specifically, in the Smart Contract, the terms of contract are kept, concerning the bursaries, terms agreed by both parties (students and universities alike). A great advantage of the DLCC system is that it is able to extract the required grades from the electronic grade book, thus supervising the students' progress throughout the semesters.

The dilemma it poses to the legal systems is that it is hardly possible to regulate a distributed network in a centralized fashion, as decentralized cryptocurrencies are antithetical to the existing centralized structure of monetary and financial regulation. This article proposes a more nuanced policy recommendation for regulatory intervention in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, which relies on a decentralized regulatory architecture built upon the existing regulatory infrastructure and makes use of the existing and emerging middlemen. It argues that instead of regulating the technology or the cryptocurrencies at the code or protocol layer, the regulation should target their use-cases. Such a regulatory strategy can be implemented through directing the edicts of regulation towards the middlemen and can be enforced by the existing financial market participants and traditional gatekeepers such as banks, payment service providers and exchanges, as well as large and centralized node operators and miners.","[Nabilou, Hossein] Univ Luxembourg, Fac Law Econ & Finance, Banking & Financial Law, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Nabilou, Hossein] Amsterdam Ctr Law & Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Nabilou, Hossein] UCL CBT, London, England","University of Luxembourg","Nabilou, H (corresponding author), Univ Luxembourg, Fac Law Econ & Finance, Banking & Financial Law, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.;Nabilou, H (corresponding author), Amsterdam Ctr Law & Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Nabilou, H (corresponding author), UCL CBT, London, England.","hossein.nabilou@uni.lu","","Nabilou, Hossein/0000-0001-8020-473X","","","","","119","8","8","4","26","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0967-0769","1464-3693","","INT J LAW INFORM TEC","Int.

Our results reveal a positive and strong correlation between gold and Bitcoin returns coinciding with specific economic and political events. Gold and Bitcoin benefit from the same economic conditions. This suggests that gold and Bitcoin are likely to be complementary, rather than in competition with each other.

In the interaction with the full node, the lightweight client leaks considerable information about which address or transaction is relevant to it. The existing schemes to solve this problem do not support efficient yet privacy-preserving transaction search due to the fact that the blockchain is inherently inefficient for transaction query and proposed schemes perform transaction search in a block-by-block manner. Therefore, we propose an efficient transaction query scheme for the privacy-preserving lightweight client with the Intel SGX enclave running on the full node. Our main idea is to leverage the secure enclave to serve transaction-query requests from lightweight clients. However, the usage of secure enclave alone does not achieve our goals. Our scheme reorganizes the blockchain and leverages prefix tree to increase transaction-search efficiency. Due to limited capacity, the secure enclave stores reorganized blockchain data in the untrusted full node. Thus, our scheme integrates prefix tree and oblivious searching technologies to simultaneously support efficient transaction search and protect access pattern of externally stored blockchain data for the secure enclave. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that our scheme provides efficient transaction search and verification functionalities for lightweight Bitcoin clients in a privacy-preserving way.","[Niu, Yukun; Zhang, Chi; Wei, Lingbo; Xie, Yankai] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Hefei 230027, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xia; Fang, Yuguang] Univ Florida, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Niu, YK (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Hefei 230027, Anhui, Peoples R China.","","zhang, chi/GRX-3610-2022","","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0802202]; Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61702474, 61871362]; US National Science Foundation [IIS-1722791]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFB0802202, and by the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grants 61702474 and 61871362.

Within a short span of 10 years, it is commendable that it has grown massively and has been easily accepted worldwide. Though the first application of this technology is cryptocurrency, blockchain technology has transcended to support more applications as well. Developers have been smart enough to study the underlying protocol and customize it according to their own requirements. Today, blockchain offers multiple functionalities like decentralization, security, transparency and democracy. Two such giants which are most popular in the blockchain world are - Bitcoin and Ethereum. The elemental difference between these two platforms of the blockchain technology is the purpose for which they have been created. In this paper, the underlying differences between these two blockchain platforms will be overviewed. Both these applications are cryptocurrencies, but the focus in this paper would be on the comparison of the the underlying concepts and their protocols. The objective of both platforms, the differences in their architectures and the consensus or agreement mechanism used between the participants would be summarized along with the scalability factors and limitations.

"J","Dimitri, N","","","","Dimitri, Nicola","","","Transaction Fees, Block Size Limit, and Auctions in Bitcoin","LEDGER","","","English","Article","","","","","","","","Confirmation of Bitcoin transactions is executed in blocks, which are then stored in the Blockchain. As compared to the number of transactions in the mempool, the set of transactions which are verified but not yet confirmed, available space for inclusion in a block is typically limited. For this reason, successful miners can only process a subset of such transactions, and users compete with each other to enter the next block by offering confirmation fees. Assuming that successful miners pursue revenue maximization, they will include in the block those mempool transactions that maximize earnings from related fees. In the paper we model transaction fees as a Nash Equilibrium outcome of an auction game with complete information. In the game the successful miner acts as an auctioneer selling block space, and users bid for shares of such space to confirm their transactions. Moreover, based on expected fees we also discuss what the optimal, revenue maximizing, block size limit should be for the successful miner. Consistently with the intuition, the optimal block size limit resolves the trade-off between including additional transactions (which possibly lower the unit fees collected) and keeping the block capacity limited (with, however, higher unit fees).","[Dimitri, Nicola] Univ Siena, Econ, Siena, Italy; [Dimitri, Nicola] UCL, Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England","University of Siena; University of London; University College London","Dimitri, N (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Econ, Siena, Italy.;Dimitri, N (corresponding author), UCL, Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England.","dimitri@unisi.it","","","Bitcoin Unlimited","Bitcoin Unlimited","The author thanks Bitcoin Unlimited for financial support and Peter Rizun for constructive comments on a previous version of the paper.

The South African Revenue Service has released a media statement regarding the normal tax treatment of cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), but policy regarding the value-added tax (VAT) treatment of cryptocurrencies is still pending. Aim: The objective of the study is to determine the output tax consequences for a South African VAT vendor who receives bitcoins in exchange for the supply of goods or services that are subject to VAT, and when the same South African VAT vendor exchanges the bitcoins for South African rand at a local exchange platform. Setting: This article examines existing literature in a South African VAT environment. Method: A non-empirical study based on existing literature is performed. Results: It is found that when interpreting the (current) VAT Act No. 89 of 1991, the receiving of bitcoin in exchange for the supply of goods or services, as well as the exchange of bitcoin for South African rand, is subject to output tax at the standard rate of 14%, which will lead to 'double taxation'. Conclusion: It was shown through this study that the proposed treatment as explained in the previous section would impose 'double taxation'.","[Greeff, Cecileen] Stellenbosch Univ, Sch Accountancy, Dept Econ & Management Sci, Stellenbosch, South Africa","Stellenbosch University","Greeff, C (corresponding author), Stellenbosch Univ, Sch Accountancy, Dept Econ & Management Sci, Stellenbosch, South Africa.","cgreeff@sun.ac.za","","Greeff, Cecileen/0000-0002-4591-3124","","","","","32","0","0","2","9","UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS","PRETORIA","TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA","2222-3436","","","S AFR J ECON MANAG S","S.

We introduce a robust automatic peak detection method that classifies price time series into periods of uninterrupted market growth (drawups) and regimes of uninterrupted market decrease (drawdowns). In combination with the Lagrange Regularization Method for detecting the beginning of a new market regime, we identify three major peaks and 10 additional smaller peaks, that have punctuated the dynamics of Bitcoin price during the analysed time period. We explain this classification of long and short bubbles by a number of quantitative metrics and graphs to understand the main socio-economic drivers behind the ascent of Bitcoin over this period. Then, a detailed analysis of the growing risks associated with the three long bubbles using the Log-Periodic Power-Law Singularity (LPPLS) model is based on the LPPLS Confidence Indicators, defined as the fraction of qualified fits of the LPPLS model over multiple time windows. Furthermore, for various fictitious 'present' times t(2) before the crashes, we employ a clustering method to group the predicted critical times tc of the LPPLS fits over different time scales, where tc is the most probable time for the ending of the bubble. Each cluster is proposed as a plausible scenario for the subsequent Bitcoin price evolution. We present these predictions for the three long bubbles and the four short bubbles that our time scale of analysis was able to resolve. Overall, our predictive scheme provides useful information to warn of an imminent crash risk.","[Gerlach, J.

It displays a graph with the predicted values. The most popular technology is the kind of technological solution that could help mankind predict future events. With vast amount of data being generated and recorded on a daily basis, we have finally come close to an era where predictions can be accurate and be generated based on concrete factual data.

The protocols making up Bitcoin must therefore accommodate the growth of the network and ensure security. Security of the Bitcoin network depends on connectivity between the nodes. Higher connectivity yields better security. In this paper we make two observations: (1) current connectivity in the Bitcoin network is too low for optimal security; (2) at the same time, increasing connectivity will substantially increase the bandwidth used by the transaction dissemination protocol, making it prohibitively expensive to operate a Bitcoin node. Half of the total bandwidth needed to operate a Bitcoin node is currently used to just announce transactions. Unlike block relay, transaction dissemination has received little attention in prior work. We propose a new transaction dissemination protocol, Erlay, that not only reduces the bandwidth consumption by 40% assuming current connectivity, but also keeps the bandwidth use almost constant as the connectivity increases. In contrast, the existing protocol increases the bandwidth consumption linearly with the number of connections. By allowing more connections at a small cost, Erlay improves the security of the Bitcoin network. And, as we demonstrate, Erlay also hardens the network against attacks that attempt to learn the origin node of a transaction. Erlay is currently being investigated by the Bitcoin community for future use with the Bitcoin protocol.","[Naumenko, Gleb; Fedorova, Alexandra; Beschastnikh, Ivan] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Wuille, Pieter] Blockstream, Victoria, BC, Canada","University of British Columbia","Naumenko, G (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.","naumenko.gs@gmail.com; greg@xiph.org; pwuille@blockstream.com; sasha@ece.ubc.ca; bestchai@cs.ubc.ca","","Wuille, Pieter/0000-0002-5530-4541","Blockstream; NSERC","Blockstream; NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","Gleb Naumenko was partially supported by Blockstream.

This was corrected by Meni Rosenfeld, who, under more realistic assumptions, gave the exact probability (missing a foundational proof); and another formula (along with foundational proof), in terms of the Incomplete Beta function, was given later by Cyril Grunspan and Ricardo Perez-Marco, that enabled them to derive an asymptotic formula for that quantity. Using Wilf-Zeilberger algorithmic proof theory, we continue in this vein and present a recurrence equation for the above-mentioned probability of success, that enables a very fast compilation of these probabilities. We next use this recurrence to derive (in algorithmic fashion) higher-order asymptotic formulas, extending the formula of Grunspan and Perez-Marco who did the leading term. We then study the statistical properties (expectation, variance, etc.) of the duration of a successful attack.","[Georgiadis, Evangelos] MathCognify Technol Ltd, Cent, Cheung Kong Ctr 19-F,2 Queens Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zeilberger, Doron] Rutgers Univ New Brunswick, Dept Math, Piscataway, NJ USA","Rutgers State University New Brunswick","Georgiadis, E (corresponding author), MathCognify Technol Ltd, Cent, Cheung Kong Ctr 19-F,2 Queens Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","egeorg@mathcognify.com","","","","","","","13","2","3","0","4","TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1023-6198","1563-5120","","J DIFFER EQU APPL","J.

Using a generalized Metcalfe's Law based on network properties, a fundamental value is quantified and shown to be heavily exceeded, on at least four occasions, by bubbles that grow and burst. In these bubbles, we detect a universal super-exponential unsustainable growth. We model this universal pattern with the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model, which parsimoniously captures diverse positive feedback phenomena, such as herding and imitation. The LPPLS model is shown to provide an ex ante warning of market instabilities, quantifying a high crash hazard and probabilistic bracket of the crash time consistent with the actual corrections; although, as always, the precise time and trigger (which straw breaks the camel's back) is exogenous and unpredictable. Looking forward, our analysis identifies a substantial but not unprecedented overvaluation in the price of Bitcoin, suggesting many months of volatile sideways Bitcoin prices ahead (from the time of writing, March 2018).","[Wheatley, Spencer; Sornette, Didier; Huber, Tobias] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Reppen, Max] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Math, Zurich, Switzerland; [Sornette, Didier] Univ Geneva, Swiss Finance Inst, Geneva, Switzerland; [Gantner, Robert N.] D ONE Solut AG, Zurich, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Geneva","Wheatley, S; Sornette, D (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland.;Sornette, D (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Swiss Finance Inst, Geneva, Switzerland.","swheatley@ethz.ch; dsornette@ethz.ch","","","","","","","49","19","20","4","9","ROYAL SOC","LONDON","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","2054-5703","","","ROY SOC OPEN SCI","R.

MuSig improves over the state-of-art scheme of Bellare and Neven (ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security-CCS 2006) and its variants by Bagherzandi et al. (ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security-CCS 2008) and Ma et al.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-signature scheme provably secure under the Discrete Logarithm assumption in the plain public-key model which allows key aggregation.

Typically, Bitcoin activity is monitored by decreasing anonymity of its entities using machine learning-based techniques, which consider the whole blockchain. This entails two issues: first, it increases the complexity of the analysis requiring higher efforts and, second, it may hide network micro-dynamics important for detecting short-term changes in entity behavioral patterns. The aim of this paper is to address both issues by performing a temporal dissection of the Bitcoin blockchain, i.e., dividing it into smaller temporal batches to achieve entity classification. The idea is that a machine learning model trained on a certain time-interval (batch) should achieve good classification performance when tested on another batch if entity behavioral patterns are similar. We apply cascading machine learning principles a type of ensemble learning applying stacking techniques introducing a k-fold cross-testing concept across batches of varying size. Results show that blockchain batch size used for entity classification could be reduced for certain classes (Exchange, Gambling, and eWallet) as classification rates did not vary significantly with batch size; suggesting that behavioral patterns did not change significantly over time. Mixer and Market class detection, however, can be negatively affected. A deeper analysis of Mining Pool behavior showed that models trained on recent data perform better than models trained on older data, suggesting that typical Mining Pool behavior may be represented better by recent data. This work provides a first step towards uncovering entity behavioral changes via temporal dissection of blockchain data.","[Zola, Francesco; Bruse, Jan Lukas; Eguimendia, Maria; Urrutia, Raul Orduna] Vicomtech, Donostia San Sebastian 20009, Spain; [Galar, Mikel] Univ Publ Navarra, Inst Smart Cities, Pamplona 31006, Spain","Universidad Publica de Navarra","Zola, F (corresponding author), Vicomtech, Donostia San Sebastian 20009, Spain.","fzola@vicomtech.org; jbruse@vicomtech.org; meguimendia@vicomtech.org; mikel.galar@unavarra.es; rorduna@vicomtech.org","Galar, Mikel/H-4846-2011; Zola, Francesco/AAU-5052-2020; Bruse, Jan Lukas/AAU-3824-2020","Galar, Mikel/0000-0003-2865-6549; Zola, Francesco/0000-0002-1733-5515; Bruse, Jan Lukas/0000-0002-5774-1593; Orduna-Urrutia, Raul/0000-0002-5932-0987","European Commission through the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, TITANIUM project [740558]","European Commission through the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, TITANIUM project","This work was partially funded by the European Commission through the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, as part of the TITANIUM project (Grant Agreement No. 740558).","","39","10","11","2","9","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2076-3417","","APPL SCI-BASEL","Appl.

However, the challenge in predicting the Bitcoin exchange rate is its high volatility. Therefore, the prediction of its behavior is of great importance for financial markets. In this way, recent studies have been carried out on what internal and/or external Bitcoin information is relevant to its prediction. The increased use of machine learning techniques to predict time series and the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as financial instruments motivated the present study to seek more accurate predictions for the Bitcoin exchange rate. In this way, in a first stage of the proposed methodology, different feature selection techniques were evaluated in order to obtain the most relevant attributes for the predictions. In the sequence, it was analyzed the behavior of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Ensemble algorithms (based on Recurrent Neural Networks and the k-Means clustering method) for price direction predictions. Likewise, the ANN and SVM were employed for regression of the maximum, minimum and closing prices of the Bitcoin. Moreover, the regression results were also used as inputs to try to improve the price direction predictions. The results showed that the selected attributes and the best machine learning model achieved an improvement of more than 10%, in accuracy, for the price direction predictions, with respect to the state-of-the-art papers, using the same period of information. In relation to the maximum, minimum and closing Bitcoin prices regressions, it was possible to obtain Mean Absolute Percentage Errors between 1% and 2%.

A CASE STUDY OF BITCOIN CURRENCY","AL-SHAJARAH","","","English","Article","","","","","","Crypto-currencies; Bitcoin; High Quality Liquid Assets; Traditional Asset Classes","TIME-SERIES; RETURNS","As crypto-currencies hold dual nature of a medium of exchange (currency) and an investment asset, some questions may arise about the potentiality of including crypto-currencies as liquid investment asset in financial institutions particularly in the banking sector to enhance their liquidity risk management and improve their portfolio diversification investment strategy. The objective of this study therefore is to examine the characteristics of Bitcoin currency based on the requirements of High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) standards of Basel III and compare its volatility structure with other traditional asset classes that are already recommended by Basle III as HQLA. The study utilizes both descriptive and quantitative analysis using the GARCH family models to examine the volatility structures of these assets. The findings show that Bitcoin currency holds the same characteristics of HQLA, however; the risk of legality and recognition is still under consideration by legal authorities around the world and this risk will be eradicated in the future as crypto-currencies derive their legality from their real intrinsic value, multi-economic usefulness and not by law as in the case of fiat money currency. Furthermore, the symmetric volatility structure analysis shows the continuing persistence of volatility and predictability behavior in return series of Bitcoin currency and other- traditional asset classes in the U.S. market. However, Bitcoin's stability has gradually improved over time. With regard to the asymmetric informative response, Bitcoin returns respond more to negative shock but it has no statistical significance, thus suggesting the lack of leveraging effect in Bitcoin market but this effect was found to be statistically persistent in other traditional asset class markets. In addition, Bitcoin returns show very low correlation with other traditional asset classes. All these imply that Bitcoin is a potential candidate as a hedge and asset diversifier, which is recommended to be included in the HQLA. This study provides some support to recent theoretical work on crypto asset return behaviour and liquidity risk management. The findings provide appropriate information about Bitcoin asset behaviour compared to other traditional asset classes which will enable them to make the right investment decision with regard to hedging, diversification and liquidity risk management. The findings of this study may assist in evaluating the suitability of including crypto assets into HQLA to improve the liquidity requirement standards and ensure that banks have an adequate amount of HQLA specifically during times of financial turmoil.","[Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah] Inst Islamic Banking & Finance IIiBF, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah; Abdullah, Adam; Haron, Razali] IIUM, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah] UKM, Bangi, Malaysia; [Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah] Geomatika Univ Coll, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah] British Acad Ctr Training & Dev, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah] ICA, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah] Lincoln Univ Collage Malaysia, Kota Baharu, Kelantan, Malaysia; [Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah] UAE Embassy, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah] Al Rwaishan Investment & Dev Co Ltd, Sanaa, Yemen","International Islamic University Malaysia","Othman, AHA (corresponding author), Inst Islamic Banking & Finance IIiBF, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.;Othman, AHA (corresponding author), UKM, Bangi, Malaysia.;Othman, AHA (corresponding author), Geomatika Univ Coll, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.;Othman, AHA (corresponding author), British Acad Ctr Training & Dev, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.;Othman, AHA (corresponding author), ICA, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.","","Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah/U-3214-2019; Abdullah, Adam/R-6267-2019","Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah/0000-0001-5759-8216; Abdullah, Adam/0000-0001-6733-5647; Haron, Razali/0000-0003-0415-4093","","","","","38","0","0","1","7","INT ISLAMIC UNIV MALAYSIA","KUALA LUMPUR","NO 24 PERSIARAN DUTA, TAMAN DUTA, KUALA LUMPUR, 50480, MALAYSIA","1394-6870","","","AL-SHAJARAH","Al-Shajarah","","2019","","","","","2","","107","145","","","","","","39","Religion","Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI)","Religion","KA5QA","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000505851900006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This attack makes the mining pool lose all bitcoin rewards contained within the block. In this paper, we construct a generalized model where two participants can choose to either cooperate with each other or employ a block withholding attack in the mining pool. To make the model more realistic, we consider both the cost of partial proof of work and the cost of cooperation. We also calculate the reward-per-time instead of profit-per-time to better measure the payoffs of each party. Further, we discuss the case where the payoff function and cost function are directly related to the computational power. The pure strategy and mixed strategy are analyzed respectively and the segmentations of the equilibrium are shown. We demonstrate that increasing the information asymmetry by utilizing information conceal mechanisms could lower the occurrence of the BWH attack.","[Di, Wu; Gang, Li] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Minist Educ Proc Control & Efficiency Engn, State Key Lab Mfg Syst Engn, Sch Management,Key Lab, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Liu Xiang-dong; Yan Xiang-bin; Rui, Peng] Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Donlinks Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Rui, Peng] Beijing Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China","Xi'an Jiaotong University; University of Science & Technology Beijing; Beijing University of Technology","Rui, P (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.","pengrui1988@bjut.edu.cn","Yan, xiangbin/AAF-8402-2019; Liu, Xiang-dong/AAU-3481-2020; Wu, Di/AAE-3581-2020","Liu, Xiang-dong/0000-0002-4270-647X; Wu, Di/0000-0002-4996-587X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71531013, 71671016, 71771024, 71832011, 71571140]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15ZDB150, 18YJC790106, 18YJCZH134]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [FRF-BR-17-008A]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","The research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71531013, 71671016, 71771024, 71832011, 71571140), the National Social Science Foundation of China (15ZDB150, 18YJC790106, 18YJCZH134), and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (FRF-BR-17-008A).","","28","14","16","1","76","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0951-8320","1879-0836","","RELIAB ENG SYST SAFE","Reliab.

We statistically test which words change in frequency between the different stages and compare four word2vec models to assess their consistency in relating connected words in weighted, undirected graphs.

While some nations are more capable than others at instilling public trust in the stability of their monetary institutions, it is nonetheless impossible for any legal system to make the precommitments necessary to completely isolate the governance of its money supply from political pressure. This proposition is true not only today, where nearly all government institutions manage their money supply in the form of central banking, but also true of past private banking regimes circulating their notes under the shadow of public law. However, bitcoin represents a potential third currency regime far more resistant to state control because it mints currency units that exist in no physical place, places a numerical ceiling on the number of units that can be created, and relies on scientific principles from cryptography to guarantee that ceiling and verify any person-to-person transfer. The trust required is not in any government but in the decentralized order of those who verify bitcoin transactions and those who create the software these verifiers choose to run on their connected computers. This Article explores the fundamental structure of bitcoin, first by demystifying it as a technology, and second by showing how its decentralized order contrasts with other currency regimes. Unlike governments that use the power of law to compel action, bitcoin relies on a system of built-in incentives to encourage behavior that benefits not only those seeking to use bitcoin, but also bitcoin miners-those who voluntarily undertake the task of maintaining the payment network. While currently bitcoin is too volatile to compete with all but the worst government-issued currencies, the qualities of this system may give bitcoin a long-term advantage over many currencies. As the bitcoin ecosystem continues to grow, its nonlegal order can help it climb the rungs of stability created by distrust in government. The technology underpinning bitcoin is the next point of innovation in the digital age-the same era that has already seen software create institutional disruption from Amazon, Facebook, and Uber, among many others. As bitcoin gains in popularity, it offers a platform for other kinds of technological alternatives to traditional legal regimes, like smart contracts. Bitcoin's order without currency law will facilitate other forms of order with less law. This is a propitious time for fundamental examination of bitcoin. Despite experiencing significant speculation and volatility throughout late 2017 and early 2018, its ten-year history demonstrates a downward trend in volatility and an upward trend in market capitalization.","[McGinnis, John O.] Northwestern Pritzker Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Roche, Kyle] Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, New York, NY USA","Northwestern University","McGinnis, JO (corresponding author), Northwestern Pritzker Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.","j-mcginnis@law.northwestern.edu; kyle@rochefreedman.com","","","","","","","173","2","2","1","14","INDIANA LAW JOURNAL","BLOOMINGTON","INDIANA UNIV SCHOOL LAW, BLOOMINGTON, IN 47405 USA","0019-6665","2169-3218","","INDIANA LAW J","Indiana Law J.","FAL","2019","94","4","","","","","1497","1554","","","","","","58","Law","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Government & Law","KC7TA","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000507374400006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The lack of a robust methodological framework and of accurate data on key factors determining Bitcoin's impact have so far been the main obstacles in such an assessment. This study applied the well-established Life Cycle Assessment methodology to an in-depth analysis of drivers of past and future environmental impacts of the Bitcoin mining network. It was found that, in 2018, the Bitcoin network consumed 31.29 TWh with a carbon footprint of 17.29 MtCO(2)-eq, an estimate that is in the lower end of the range of results from previous studies. The main drivers of such impact were found to be the geographical distribution of miners and the efficiency of the mining equipment.

Towards that, we revisit the prior work, dedicated to the study of centralization of Bitcoin nodes over the Internet, through a fine-grained analysis of network distribution, and highlight the increasing centralization of the Bitcoin network over time. As a result, we show that Bitcoin is vulnerable to spatial, temporal, spatio-temporal, and logical partitioning attacks with an increased attack feasibility due to the network dynamics. We verify our observations by simulating attack scenarios and the implications of each attack on the Bitcoin network.

From the viewpoint of network measurement, we would like to observe this topology so we can characterize its performance, fairness and robustness. However, this is difficult because Bitcoin is deliberately designed to hide its topology from onlookers. Knowledge of the topology is not in itself a vulnerability, although it could conceivably help an attacker performing targeted eclipse attacks or to deanonymize transaction senders. In this paper we present TxProbe, a novel technique for reconstructing the Bitcoin network topology. TxProbe makes use of peculiarities in how Bitcoin processes out of order, or orphaned transactions. We conducted experiments on Bitcoin testnet that suggest our technique reconstructs topology with precision and recall surpassing 90%. We also used TxProbe to take a snapshot of the Bitcoin testnet in just a few hours. TxProbe may be useful for future measurement campaigns of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency networks.","[Delgado-Segura, Sergi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain; [Bakshi, Surya; Miller, Andrew] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Perez-Sola, Cristina] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Tarragona, Spain; [Litton, James; Pachulski, Andrew; Bhattacharjee, Bobby] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park","Delgado-Segura, S (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain.;Miller, A (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.","s.delgado@ucl.ac.uk; soc1024@illinois.edu","","Perez-Sola, Cristina/0000-0001-7534-1326","","","","","17","21","19","1","3","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-32101-7; 978-3-030-32100-0","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2019","11598","","","","","","550","566","","10.1007/978-3-030-32101-7_32","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-32101-7_32","","","17","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP1SH","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000540724500032","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Among the most well-known are block withholding (BWH), fork after withholding (FAW), and selfish mining. In this paper, we propose two new strategies: power adjusting and bribery racing, and introduce two novel mining attacks, Power Adjusting Withholding (PAW) and Bribery Selfish Mining (BSM) adopting the new strategies. Both attacks can increase the reward of attackers. Furthermore, we show PAW can avoid the miner's dilemma in BWH attacks. BSM introduces a new venal miner's dilemma, which results in all targets (bribes) willing to help the attacker but getting less reward finally. Quantitative analyses and simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our attacks. We propose some countermeasures to mitigate the new attacks, but a practical and efficient solution remains to be an open problem.","[Gao, Shang; Li, Zecheng; Peng, Zhe; Xiao, Bin] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Hong Kong Polytechnic University","Gao, S (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","cssgao@comp.polyu.edu.hk; cszcli@comp.polyu.edu.hk; cszpeng@comp.polyu.edu.hk; csbxiao@comp.polyu.edu.hk","Xiao, Bin/AAZ-4848-2020","Xiao, Bin/0000-0003-4223-8220; Gao, Shang/0000-0003-2692-057X; PENG, Zhe/0000-0002-6674-1640","HK RGC GRF PolyU [152124/19E, HK ITF ITS/081/18]","HK RGC GRF PolyU","We gratefully acknowledge Tao Lu from Erasmus University for helpful technical discussions about conditional expectation.

This is achieved by accounting for the impacts of the three major global factors, namely the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPU), the Crude Oil Volatility Index (OVX), and the Geopolitical Risk Index (GPR). To do this, we use Wavelet Coherence (WC), Cross Wavelet Transform (CWT), Power Wavelet Coherence (PWC), and Multiple Wavelet Coherence (MWC) approaches. The results show that the BTC-VIX relationship varies across time and at high and low frequencies. Moreover, we find positive (or in-phase) co-movements between both variables while a negative co-movement (out-of-phase) is observed at both high and low frequencies. VIX news has a prediction power on BTC price returns over different frequencies. The results of PWC and MWC show that OVX, EPU, and GPR factors affect the BTC-VIX nexus under different frequencies. Finally, correlations between BTC-uncertainty indices are dependent upon investment horizons. The results of our research are of interest and importance to investors, portfolio managers, and policy-makers, as the results have practical applications to inform their decision-making.","[Al-Yahyaee, Khamis Hamed; Mensi, Walid] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ & Finance, Muscat, Oman; [Rehman, Mobeen Ur] South Ural State Univ, 76 Lenin Prospekt, Chelyabinsk, Russia; [Rehman, Mobeen Ur] Univ Econ, Dept Res Adm & Int Relat, 59C Nguyen Dinh Chieu,Ward 6,Dist 3, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Al-Jarran, Idries Mohammad Wanas] Qatar Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Doha, Qatar","Sultan Qaboos University; South Ural State University; Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; Qatar University","Mensi, W (corresponding author), Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ & Finance, Muscat, Oman.","yahyai@squ.edu.om; Mobeenrehman@live.com; walid.mensi@fsegt.rnu.tn; idries@qu.edu.qa","Al-Jarrah, Idries/GRJ-0970-2022; mensi, walid/R-6139-2016; Rehman, Mobeen Ur/B-4368-2017","Rehman, Mobeen Ur/0000-0002-8889-9051; Al-Jarrah, Idries/0000-0002-5486-7107; Al-Yahyaee, Khamis/0000-0003-2669-0663","","","","","30","50","52","1","33","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1062-9408","1879-0860","","N AM J ECON FINANC","N.

They enable self-enforcing payments between users depending on complex program logic. Unfortunately, Bitcoin - the largest and by far most widely used cryptocurrency - does not offer support for complex smart contracts. Moreover, simple contracts that can be executed on Bitcoin are often cumbersome to design and very costly to execute. In this work we present FASTKITTEN, a practical framework for executing arbitrarily complex smart contracts at low costs over decentralized cryptocurrencies which are designed to only support simple transactions. To this end, FASTKITTEN leverages the power of trusted computing environments (TEEs), in which contracts are run off-chain to enable efficient contract execution at low cost. We formally prove that FASTKITTEN satisfies strong security properties when all but one party are malicious. Finally, we report on a prototype implementation which supports arbitrary contracts through a scripting engine, and evaluate performance through benchmarking a provably fair online poker game. Our implementation illustrates that FASTKITTEN is practical for complex multi-round applications with a very small latency. Combining these features, FASTKITTEN is the first truly practical framework for complex smart contract execution over Bitcoin.","[Das, Poulami; Eckey, Lisa; Frassetto, Tommaso; Gens, David; Hostakova, Kristina; Jauernig, Patrick; Faust, Sebastian; Sadeghi, Ahmad-Reza] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany","Technical University of Darmstadt","Das, P (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany.","poulami.das@cs.tu-darmstadt.de; lisa.eckey@cs.tu-darmstadt.de; tommaso.frassetto@trust.tu-darmstadt.de; david.gens@trust.tu-darmstadt.de; kristina.hostakova@cs.tu-darmstadt.de; patrick.jauernig@trust.tu-darmstadt.de; sebastian.faust@cs.tu-darmstadt.de; ahmad-reza.sadeghi@trust.tu-darmstadt.de","","","German Research Foundation (DFG) [CRC 1119, FA 1320/1-1]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within CRISP; Hessen State Ministry for Higher Education, Research and the Arts (HMWK) within CRISP; BMBF within the iBlockchain project; Intel Collaborative Research Institute for Collaborative Autonomous & Resilient Systems (ICRI-CARS)","German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within CRISP(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Hessen State Ministry for Higher Education, Research and the Arts (HMWK) within CRISP; BMBF within the iBlockchain project(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Intel Collaborative Research Institute for Collaborative Autonomous & Resilient Systems (ICRI-CARS)","This work has been supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of projects HWSec, P3 and S7 within the CRC 1119 CROSSING and the Emmy Noether Program FA 1320/1-1, by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Hessen State Ministry for Higher Education, Research and the Arts (HMWK) within CRISP, by BMBF within the iBlockchain project, by the Intel Collaborative Research Institute for Collaborative Autonomous & Resilient Systems (ICRI-CARS).","","60","22","24","0","3","USENIX ASSOC","BERKELEY","SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA","","","978-1-939133-06-9","","","","2019","","","","","","","801","818","","","","","","18","Computer Science, Information Systems","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO3AB","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000509775000046","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Thus, it raises an interesting question: Is there abnormity or illegal behavior in Bitcoin platforms? To answer this question, we investigate the abnormity in five leading Bitcoin platforms. By analyzing the financial index, i.e. the normalized logarithmic price return, we find that the properties of price return in bitFlyer are completely different from others. To find the possible reasons, we find that the abnormal ask price and bid price appear simultaneously in bitFlyer, which may be potentially linked to either price manipulation or money laundering. It verifies our conjecture that there may be abnormity or price manipulation in Bitcoin platforms.

Blockchain systems are particularly vulnerable to such attacks as they rely on Internet-wide communications to reach consensus. In particular, Bitcoin-the most widely-used cryptocurrency-can be split in half by any AS-level adversary using BGP hijacking. In this paper, we present SABRE, a secure and scalable Bitcoin relay network which relays blocks worldwide through a set of connections that are resilient to routing attacks. SABRE runs alongside the existing peer-to-peer network and is easily deployable. As a critical system, SABRE design is highly resilient and can efficiently handle high bandwidth loads, including Denial of Service attacks. We built SABRE around two key technical insights. First, we leverage fundamental properties of inter-domain routing (BGP) policies to host relay nodes: (i) in networks that are inherently protected against routing attacks; and (ii) on paths that are economically-preferred by the majority of Bitcoin clients. These properties are generic and can be used to protect other Blockchain-based systems. Second, we leverage the fact that relaying blocks is communication-heavy, not computation-heavy. This enables us to offload most of the relay operations to programmable network hardware (using the P4 programming language). Thanks to this hardware/software co-design, SABRE nodes operate seamlessly under high load while mitigating the effects of malicious clients. We present a complete implementation of SABRE together with an extensive evaluation. Our results demonstrate that SABRE is effective at securing Bitcoin against routing attacks, even with deployments of as few as 6 nodes.","[Apostolaki, Maria; Marti, Gian; Mueller, Jan; Vanbever, Laurent] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich","Apostolaki, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.","apmaria@ethz.ch; gimarti@student.ethz.ch; jan.m.muller@me.com; lvanbever@ethz.ch","Marti, Gian/ABI-1471-2020","Marti, Gian/0000-0001-6848-0213","Swiss National Science Foundation Grant (Data-Driven Internet Routing) [200021-175525]","Swiss National Science Foundation Grant (Data-Driven Internet Routing)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))","We thank the members of the Networked Systems Group at ETH Zurich for their valuable feedback.

We also include procedures that take into account the presence of outliers and estimate the volatility and Value-at-Risk in a robust fashion. Our results show that robust procedures outperform non-robust ones when forecasting the volatility and estimating the Value at-Risk.

With Bitcoin, the first blockchain-based cryptocurrency, monetary policy is enacted via software built through an open source consensus model. This promotes a techno-decentralist ideology that promises to democratize societies by eradicating centralized points of control in economic systems. Contrastingly, this paper demonstrates how Bitcoin's production process operates through strict authoritative channels. The overall political framework for altering the Bitcoin code is described as senatorial governance: a (de)centralized model of bureaucratic parties who compete to change the monetary policy (codified rules) of the protocol. This model shows how Bitcoin is not an autonomous system but is assembled and maintained via human discretion.","[Parkin, Jack] Western Sydney Univ, Inst Culture & Soc, Parramatta Campus,Locked Bag 1797, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Western Sydney University","Parkin, J (corresponding author), Western Sydney Univ, Inst Culture & Soc, Parramatta Campus,Locked Bag 1797, Sydney, NSW, Australia.","j.parkin@westernsydney.edu.au","","","","","","","65","15","15","1","12","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0308-5147","1469-5766","","ECON SOC","Econ.

To deal with, we dynamically analyse the evolution of the self-similarity exponent of Bitcoin-USD daily returns via accurate FD4 approach by a 512 day sliding window with overlapping data. Further, we define the memory indicator by the difference between the self-similarity exponent of Bitcoin-USD series and the self similarity index of its shuffled series. We also carry out additional analyses via FD4 approach by sliding windows of sizes equal to 64, 128, 256, and 1024 days, and also via FD algorithm for values of q equal to 1 and 2 (and sliding windows equal to 512 days). Moreover, we explored the evolution of the self-similarity exponent of actual S&P500 series via FD4 algorithm by sliding windows of sizes equal to 256 and 512 days. In all the cases, the obtained results were found to be similar to our first analysis. We conclude that the self-similarity exponent of the BTC-USD (resp., S&P500) series stands above 0.5. However, this is not due to the presence of significant memory in the series but to its underlying distribution. In fact, it holds that the self-similarity exponent of BTC-USD (resp., S&P500) series is similar or lower than the self-similarity index of a random series with the same distribution. As such, several periods with significant antipersistent memory in BTC-USD (resp., S&P500) series are distinguished.","[Dimitrova, V.; Trinidad Segovia, J.

In this mechanism, the process of generating a new block in the blockchain is referred to as mining. Such process is intentionally designed to be resource-intensive and time consuming so that the rate of block generation remains steady. A single participant, called a miner usually has limited computation power to produce PoWs. This leads miners to form a mining pool, where miners aggregate their computing power and share the rewards. However, a phenomenon raises in such a mining pool activity, where miners attack each other. Consequently, this results in a decrease in total rewards received from the mining pool. To address the abovementioned problem, we build a multi-miner model for forming a mining pool. We further propose a method to improve the cooperation-probability of miners in the pool by introducing a Zero-Determinant strategy and a Temporal Difference learning method (TD(lambda)). Experimental simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively promote the cooperation among miners, therefore, increase the rewards received from the formed mining pool.","[Ou, Wei; Deng, Mingwei; Luo, Entao] Hunan Univ Sci & Engn, Dept Elect & Informat Engn, Yongzhou, Peoples R China; [Shi, Wei] Carleton Univ, Sch Informat Technol, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Tan, Zhiyuan] Napier Univ Edinburgh, Sch Comp Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Bhuiyan, Md Zakirul Alam] Fordham Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, New York, NY 10023 USA","Carleton University; Edinburgh Napier University; Fordham University","Ou, W (corresponding author), Hunan Univ Sci & Engn, Dept Elect & Informat Engn, Yongzhou, Peoples R China.","ouwei1978430@163.com; sherdan@126.com; cs_entaoluo@csu.edu.cn; wei.shi@carleton.ca; z.tan@napier.ac.uk","Tan, Zhiyuan/K-3120-2019","Tan, Zhiyuan/0000-0001-5420-2554","construct program of applied characteristic discipline in Hunan University of Science and Engineering","construct program of applied characteristic discipline in Hunan University of Science and Engineering","Supported by the construct program of applied characteristic discipline in Hunan University of Science and Engineering","","11","0","0","1","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-2980-8","","","","2019","","","","","","","687","693","","10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00131","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00131","","","7","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Telecommunications","BQ2KL","","Green Accepted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000579857700108","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, power dissipation is an important issue considering it causes increased mining cost and creates excessive heat. This paper presents three optimization techniques in the micro-architecture level for Bitcoin mining: deep pipelining, speculative computation, and approximate addition. The computations for Bitcoin milling are dominated by SHA-256, which can be realized by two-way 32-stage pipelines. Deep pipelining reduces the critical-path delay, resulting in less power due to architecture transformation and transistor sizing. The iterations of SHA-256 can be early terminated by leveraging speculative computation to prevent unnecessary switches. Approximate addition is adopted to reduce the critical-path delay of the compressor and expander at the cost of negligible precision loss. From the synthesis estimates at a 40-nm technology node, an overall 59.3% power reduction is achieved by applying these three techniques.","[Wang, Yu-Zhe; Yang, Chia-Hsiang] Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Elect Engn, Taipei, Taiwan; [Wu, Jingjie] Canaan Inc, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shi-Hao] Digwise Technol Ltd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chao, Mango Chia-Tso] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Hsinchu, Taiwan","National Taiwan University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University","Wang, YZ (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Elect Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.","","","","","","","","12","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2474-2724","","978-1-7281-0655-7","INT SYMPOS VLSI DES","","","2019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering","BN3NJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000480385400028","View Full Record in Web of Science"

With many new protocols proposed to improve the performance of LN, little is known about the current state of the network such as its topology, channel characteristics and application performance. In this paper, we conduct a systematic measurement on LN based on the data collected over a period of fifteen months. This measurement allows us to draw a network graph to study the payment routing success rate and the level of decentralization. We also analyze payment channels regarding their functions.

Despite the particular interest of the public, the theoretical understanding of the value of this crypto currency is limited. This is why current research is trying to find better leads to evaluate a complex phenomenon: the BTC price. The volatility of its price presents a certain specificity compared to the traditional currencies. In order to understand the reasons for this volatility, we try to identify and to analyze the main determinants of the BTC price and to estimate their influence. We apply time series to daily data for the period from 19/12/2011 to 06/02/2018. We used several approaches, including the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag ARDL model, the cointegration test at Pesaran et al. (2001) and the Granger causality test in the sense of Toda and Yamamoto (1995). Our estimated results suggest that the number of addresses, the attractiveness indicator and the mining difficulty have a significant impact on the BTC price with variations over time. On the other hand, the transaction volume, the stock, the EUR/USD exchange rate and the macroeconomic and financial development do not determine the price of the BTC in the short term as well as in the long term.

This scheme represents a first integration of the use of cryptocurrencies by members of the spamming industry. Using a dataset of 4,340,736 sextortion spams, this research aims at understanding such new amalgamation by uncovering spammers' operations. To do so, a simple, yet effective method for projecting Bitcoin addresses mentioned in sextortion spams onto transaction graph abstractions is computed over the entire Bitcoin blockchain. This allows us to track and investigate monetary flows between involved actors and gain insights into the financial structure of sextortion campaigns. We find that sextortion spammers are somewhat sophisticated, following pricing strategies and benefiting from cost reductions as their operations cut the upper-tail of the spamming supply chain. We discover that one single entity is likely controlling the financial backbone of the majority of the sextortion campaigns and that the 11-month operation studied yielded a lower-bound revenue between $1,300,620 and $1,352,266. We conclude that sextortion spamming is a lucrative business and spammers will likely continue to send bulk emails that try to extort money through cryptocurrencies.","[Paquet-Clouston, Masarah] GoSecure, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Romiti, Matteo; Haslhofer, Bernhard] Austrian Inst Technol, Seibersdorf, Austria; [Charvat, Thomas] Excello, Prague, Czech Republic","Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT)","Paquet-Clouston, M (corresponding author), GoSecure, Montreal, PQ, Canada.","mcpc@gosecure.net; Matteo.Romiti@ait.ac.at; Bernhard.Haslhofer@ait.ac.at; tc@excello.cz","","","European Union [740558]; Austrian FFG's KIRAS programme under project VIRTCRIME [860672]","European Union(European Commission); Austrian FFG's KIRAS programme under project VIRTCRIME","Work on this topic is supported inter alia by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 740558 (TITANIUM) and the Austrian FFG's KIRAS programme under project VIRTCRIME (No. 860672).","","37","12","12","1","4","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-6732-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","76","88","","10.1145/3318041.3355466","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3318041.3355466","","","13","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO5QB","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000518634900006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Evidence from Greece","ECONOMICS BULLETIN","","","English","Article","","","","","","","","The worldwide heightened economic uncertainty in countries like Venezuela, India, Britain, and Italy has strengthened more demand for Bitcoin. The deadlock between Greece and creditors doesn't seem to be going away and Greeks are very tired of the most punishing austerity measures connected to repayments of the loans. Greek people, who become increasingly mistrustful of their government, found solace in the Bitcoin as a refuge asset. The novelty of this paper lies in its methodological approach, which can pinpoint the dynamic effects of uncertainty surrounding the debt crisis on the interest in Bitcoin as an alternative to conventional and state-sanctioned banking system. Our findings confirm the great resilience of Bitcoin during periods of turmoil, highlighting its potential safe haven ability against uncertainty.","[Bouoiyour, Jamal; Selmi, Refk] CATT Univ Pau, IRMAPE ESC Pau Business Sch, Pau, France","Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour","Bouoiyour, J (corresponding author), CATT Univ Pau, IRMAPE ESC Pau Business Sch, Pau, France.","jamal.bouoiyour@univ-pau.fr; s.refk@yahoo.fr","","","","","","","14","5","5","0","1","ECONOMICS BULLETIN","NASHVILLE","C/O JOHN CONLEY, DEPT ECONOMICS, 414 CALHOUN HALL, NASHVILLE, TN 37235 USA","1545-2921","","","ECON BULL","Econ.

Recently, its dynamical evolution has attracted the attention of the research community due to its completeness and richness in historical records. In this paper, we focus on the detailed evolution of bitcoin trading with the aim of elucidating the mechanism that drives the formation of the bitcoin transaction network. Our empirical investigation reveals that although the temporal properties of the transaction network possesses scale-free degree distribution like many other networks, its formation mechanism is different from the commonly assumed models of degree preferential attachment or wealth preferential attachment. By defining the fitness value of each node as the ability of the node to attract new connections, we have instead uncovered that the observed scale-free degree distribution results from the intrinsic fitness of each node following a power-law distribution. Our finding thus suggests that the good-get-richer rather than the rich-get-richer paradigm operates within the bitcoin ecosystem. Based on these findings, we propose a model that captures the temporal generative process by means of a fitness preferential attachment and data-driven birth/death mechanism. Our proposed model is able to produce structural properties in good agreement with those obtained from the empirical bitcoin network.","[Aspembitova, Ayana; Chew, Lock Yue] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Phys & Appl Phys, 21 Nanyang Link, Singapore, Singapore; [Aspembitova, Ayana; Feng, Ling] Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Inst High Performance Comp, 1 Fusionopolis Way, Singapore, Singapore; [Feng, Ling] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Phys, 2 Sci Dr 3, Singapore, Singapore; [Melnikov, Valentin; Chew, Lock Yue] Nanyang Technol Univ, Complex Inst, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore, Singapore; [Chew, Lock Yue] Nanyang Technol Univ, Data Sci & Artificial Intelligence Res Ctr, Block N4 02a-32,Nanyang Ave, Singapore, Singapore","Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC); National University of Singapore; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University","Chew, LY (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Phys & Appl Phys, 21 Nanyang Link, Singapore, Singapore.;Feng, L (corresponding author), Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Inst High Performance Comp, 1 Fusionopolis Way, Singapore, Singapore.;Feng, L (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Phys, 2 Sci Dr 3, Singapore, Singapore.;Chew, LY (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Complex Inst, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore, Singapore.;Chew, LY (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Data Sci & Artificial Intelligence Res Ctr, Block N4 02a-32,Nanyang Ave, Singapore, Singapore.","felney@gmail.com; lockyue@ntu.edu.sg","Feng, Ling/ABD-1751-2020","Feng, Ling/0000-0001-6578-2558; Aspembitova, Ayana/0000-0002-5418-1914; Melnikov, Valentin/0000-0002-9236-6717; Chew, Lock Yue/0000-0003-1366-8205","","","","","45","9","9","1","5","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","AUG 23","2019","14","8","","","","","","","e0219346","10.1371/journal.pone.0219346","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219346","","","20","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","IW5TR","31442228","Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000485041400005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Bitcoin is a crypto-currency engendered by new computation technology which relies on a distributed network of peer-to-peer computing agents referred to as 'miners'. These agents earn bitcoins by successfully settling and securing economic transactions in electronic ledgers called blocks. Successive blocks are stringed together to form blockchains. This radically different world of alternative currencies heralds a change that leaves Leviathans nonplussed for four reasons. First, bitcoin miners, who function as neo-Spinozian multitudes, squarely challenge the prerogative of the State to issue fiat money. Second, these distributed communities usher in a new philosophy of time in order to measure their mining efforts objectively. Third, these communities change the existing state of affairs by linking bitcoin earnings to 'proof of work'. The fourth contribution of this unique community lies in the ideas of consensus they embrace. However, in recent times, crypto currency miners, who are forced to ramp up their mining operations, are constrained to depend on the world of fiat money in order to mobilize resources. What was primarily designed as a digital means of payment has turned into a speculative asset undermining its ability to replace fiat money. This paper argues that the future of distributed networks will depend on whether they can obviate their pernicious dependence on the Leviathan by adopting rigorous codes of conduct for conducting their operations both autonomously and more sustainably.","[Appukuttan Nair, Damodaran] Indian Inst Management Bangalore, Bangalore, Karnataka, India","Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Bangalore","Nair, DA (corresponding author), Indian Inst Management Bangalore, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.","damodaran@iimb.ac.in","","","","","","","49","4","4","2","7","TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","2157-930X","2157-9318","","INNOV DEV","Innov.

Given the wide applicability of micropayment, it is crucial for all cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin to provide effective support therein. In light of this, a number of low-cost micropayment schemes for Bitcoin have been proposed recently to reduce micropayment costs. Existing schemes, however, suffer from drawbacks such as high computation cost, inflexible payment value, and possibly unfair exchanges. The paper proposes two new micropayment schemes, namely the basic MicroBTC and the advanced MicroBTC, for Bitcoin by integrating the hash chain technique into cryptocurrency transactions. The basic MicroBTC realizes micropayment by exposing hash pre-images on the hash chain one by one, and it can also make arbitrary micropayments by exposing multiple hash pre-images. We further design the advanced MicroBTC to achieve non-interactive refund and efficient hash chain verification. We analyze the complexity and security of the both MicroBTC schemes and implement them using the Bitcoin source code. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate their performance, and the result showed that a micropayment session can be processed within about 18ms for the basic MicroBTC and 9ms for the advanced MicroBTC on a laptop. Both schemes enjoy great efficiency in computation and flexibility in micropayments, and they also achieve fairness for both the payer and the payee.","[Wan, Zhi-Guo] Shandong Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266237, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Deng, Robert H.] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Informat Syst, Singapore 188065, Singapore; [Lee, David] Singapore Univ Social Sci, Sch Business, Singapore 599494, Singapore; [Li, Ying] Beijing Inst Tracking & Telecommun Technol, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China","Shandong University; Singapore Management University; Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS)","Wan, ZG (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266237, Shandong, Peoples R China.","wanzhiguo@sdu.edu.cn; robertdeng@smu.edu.sg; davidleekc@suss.edu.sg; liying@bittt.cn","","Deng, Robert/0000-0003-3491-8146","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61370027, 61832012]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 61370027 and 61832012.","","16","4","4","4","20","SCIENCE PRESS","BEIJING","16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA","1000-9000","1860-4749","","J COMPUT SCI TECH-CH","J.

However, many applications need much faster transaction confirmation than that of the current Bitcoin blockchain. In this paper, we present a high-throughput, low-latency, deterministic confirmation mechanism called ACCEL for accelerating Bitcoin's block confirmation mechanism. Our key idea for achieving faster confirmation is the quick identification of singular blocks that provably belong to the blockchain. While it is impossible to determine with certainty if a block belongs to a blockchain when network delays are unbounded, singular block detection exploits the fact that the end-to-end latency between Bitcoin miners is substantially lower than the inter-block spacing and can be assumed to be upper bounded. ACCEL is especially suitable for low-latency, permissioned blockchains, where the block spacing can he optimized to the blockchain's small latencies to greatly improve throughput. We evaluate ACCEL's performance with extensive simulations and with a real implementation built with minimal changes to and fully compatible with the Bitcoin blockchain. We show that with appropriate bounds on the end-to-end latency, it is possible to reduce transaction confirmation latencies to milliseconds with ACCEL, and so meet the performance needs of a wide range of applications.","[Hari, Adiseshu; Kodialam, Murali; Lakshman, T.

However, the verification of Bitcoin transactions requires nodes to download the whole blockchain, which is infeasible for resource-constraint devices. Traditional schemes tried to transfer most of the storage and computation tasks from a lightweight client to a full node. Nevertheless, these schemes would severely violate users' privacy since they would leak transaction ID and public-key address when a lightweight client queries the full node. To address this, we propose a privacy-preserving approach to secure queries of simplified payment verification (SPV) clients. Specifically, we design a d-differentially private mechanism based on trusted hardware such that semi-honest adversaries cannot acquire the real access pattern during shards retrieval phase. Data-oblivious primitives are adopted to prevent the internal search pattern leakage owing to side-channel attacks. Our scheme is more secure than traditional SPV schemes, and it is proved to satisfy d-differential privacy definition. Our prototype implementation with the Bitcoin blockchain dataset shows its practicality.","[Li, Xudong; Yang, Zhe; Wei, Lingbo; Zhang, Chi] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Hefei 230027, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Li, XD (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Hefei 230027, Peoples R China.","xudongli@mail.ustc.edu.cn; yzpag@mail.ustc.edu.cn; lingbowei@ustc.edu.cn; chizhang@ustc.edu.cn","zhang, chi/GRX-3610-2022","","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0802202]; Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61702474, 61871362]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFB0802202, and by the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grants 61702474 and 61871362","","16","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2377-8644","","978-1-7281-0732-5","IEEE INT CONF COMMUN","","","2019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BR7RK","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000669646800126","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Two-party or multi-party payment channel using multi-signature address formed a connected payment network to solve the issue of scaling that fascinated bitcoin community. The micropayment channel solution implicitly assumes that parties will continue to interact for long intervals. This assumes a long-lived relation between buyer and seller. Another major disadvantage of forcing participants to lock funds for long intervals. The micropayment channel must know about the parties beforehand. We address this issue and present a protocol that offers freedom to do micropayment transaction with anyone as per the need without any prior knowledge about the parties. The protocol gives an alternate secured path for zero-confirmation transactions. From the test cases, we have shown that buyer will get quick services from sellers and honest sellers will not lose their funds share.","[Arote, Prerna; Kuri, Joy] Indian Inst Sci, Dept Elect Syst Engn, Bangalore, Karnataka, India","Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore","Arote, P (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Dept Elect Syst Engn, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.","prernaarote@iisc.ac.in; kuri@iisc.ac.in","","","","","","","13","1","1","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2155-2487","","978-1-5386-7902-9","INT CONF COMMUN SYST","","","2019","","","","","","","31","35","","","","","","5","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BM8UI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000470001000006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In the Bitcoin blockchain, efficient block propagation approach can reduce the computing power and the risk of forks. Meanwhile, larger blocks help to improve the throughput of transactions. Thus, the block propagation is a major issue of the scalability of the Bitcoin network. This paper introduces a method to reduce the required bandwidth of block propagation with erasure coding. To begin with, the network nodes are classified into several clusters. When a node wants to propagate a block, the node does not need to propagate the whole information of the block. Instead, the node can only transmit the transaction IDs and the coded information to each cluster. The simulation shows that the proposed method can significantly ease the network traffic among these clusters.","[Jin, Ming; Chen, Xiaojiao; Lin, Sian-Jheng] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, CAS Key Lab Electromagnet Space Informat, Hefei 230027, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Lin, SAH (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, CAS Key Lab Electromagnet Space Informat, Hefei 230027, Peoples R China.","sjlin@ustc.edu.cn","","Lin, Sian Jheng/0000-0002-6309-2876","Hundred Talents Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province [BJ2100330001]","Hundred Talents Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province)","This work was supported in part by the Hundred Talents Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province under Grant BJ2100330001.","","28","7","8","1","4","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2019","7","","","","","","175606","175613","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2957496","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2957496","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","KF7DI","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000509399500037","View Full Record in Web of Science"

During the last quarters the network size contains about 6 million users (nodes) with about 150 million transactions. From PageRank and CheiRank probabilities, analogous to trade import and export, we determine the dimensionless trade balance of each user and model the contagion propagation on the network assuming that a user goes bankrupt if its balance exceeds a certain dimensionless threshold.. We find that the phase transition takes place for kappa < kappa(c) approximate to 0.1 with almost all users going bankrupt. For kappa > 0.55 almost all users remain safe. We find that even on a distance from the critical threshold.c the top PageRank and CheiRank users, as a house of cards, rapidly drop to the bankruptcy. We attribute this effect to strong interconnections between these top users which we determine with the reduced Google matrix algorithm. This algorithm allows to establish efficiently the direct and indirect interactions between top PageRank users.

As Machine-to-Machine (M2M) payments are fundamental in the IoT economy, the development of Blockchain-based payment platforms, using cryptocurrency, is continuously increasing as it enables a pure M2M, secure and private financial transactions. Unlike traditional assets, cryptocurrencies have a higher index of volatility, which makes it essential to understand the movement of their prices, as a first step to optimize Blockchain-based M2M payment transactions. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model that deals with this challenge from a descriptive, as well as predictive points of view. We use Hidden Markov Models to describe cryptocurrencies historical movements to predict future movements with Long Short Term Memory networks. To evaluate the proposed hybrid model, we have chosen 2-minute frequency Bitcoin data from Coinbase exchange market. Our proposed model proved its effectiveness compared to traditional time-series forecasting models, ARIMA, as well as a conventional LSTM.","[Abu Hashish, Iman; Forni, Fabio; Andreotti, Gianluca; Facchinetti, Tullio] Univ Pavia, Dept Elect Comp & Biomed Engn, Pavia, Italy; [Darjani, Shiva] Univ Zanjan, Dept Elect Engn, Zanjan, Iran","University of Pavia; University Zanjan","Abu Hashish, I (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dept Elect Comp & Biomed Engn, Pavia, Italy.","","","Abu Hashish, Iman/0000-0002-2345-8140","","","","","31","11","11","1","7","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1946-0740","","978-1-7281-0303-7","IEEE INT C EMERG","","","2019","","","","","","","721","728","","","","","","8","Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Manufacturing; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Automation & Control Systems; Engineering; Telecommunications","BP5MR","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000556596600092","View Full Record in Web of Science"

As forks can be caused by numerous factors such as latency and miner behavior, their analysis provides insights into these factors, which are otherwise unknown. In this paper we provide an empirical analysis of the announcement and propagation of blocks that led to forks of the Bitcoin blockchain. By analyzing the time differences in the publication of competing blocks, we show that the block propagation delay between miners can be of similar order as the block propagation delay of the average Bitcoin peer. Furthermore, we show that the probability of a block to become part of the main chain increases roughly linearly in the time the block has been published before the competing block. Additionally, we show that the observed frequency of short block intervals between two consecutive blocks mined by the same miner after a fork is conspicuously large. While selfish mining can be a cause for this observation, other causes are also possible. Finally, we show that not only the time difference of the publication of competing blocks but also their propagation speeds vary greatly.","[Neudecker, Till; Hartenstein, Hannes] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Telemat, Karlsruhe, Germany","Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology","Neudecker, T (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Telemat, Karlsruhe, Germany.","till.neudecker@kit.edu; hannes.hartenstein@kit.edu","","","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the project KASTEL IoE in the Competence Center for Applied Security Technology (KASTEL); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the project KASTEL ISE in the Competence Center for Applied Security Technology (KASTEL); state of Baden-Wurttemberg through bwHPC; state of Baden-Wurttemberg through bwFileStorage; state of Baden-Wurttemberg through LSDF","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the project KASTEL IoE in the Competence Center for Applied Security Technology (KASTEL); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the project KASTEL ISE in the Competence Center for Applied Security Technology (KASTEL); state of Baden-Wurttemberg through bwHPC; state of Baden-Wurttemberg through bwFileStorage; state of Baden-Wurttemberg through LSDF","This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the projects KASTEL IoE and KASTEL ISE in the Competence Center for Applied Security Technology (KASTEL) and by the state of Baden-Wurttemberg through bwHPC, bwFileStorage, and LSDF.

Eyal and Sirer showed, however, that a selfish miner is incentivized to deviate from the protocol and withhold its blocks under certain conditions. The analysis by Eyal and Sirer, as well as in followup work, considers a single selfish miner (who may control a large fraction of the hashing power in the network) interacting with a remaining pool of honest miners. Here, we extend this analysis to the case where there are multiple (non-colluding) selfish miners. We find that in this setting there are cases in which it may be profitable for those miners to deviate even when they would not be incentivized to deviate individually.","[Marmolejo-Cossio, Francisco J.] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Brigham, Eric] New Coll Florida, Sarasota, FL USA; [Sela, Benjamin; Katz, Jonathan] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","University of Oxford; State University System of Florida; New College Florida; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park","Marmolejo-Cossio, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.","francisco.marmolejo@cs.ox.ac.uk; eric.brigham15@ncf.edu; benj.sela@gmail.com; jkatz@cs.umd.edu","","Marmolejo-Cossio, Francisco/0000-0003-3219-7963","NSF [CNS-1560193]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","Work of Eric Brigham was done at the University of Maryland as part of the NSF REU-CAAR program, and was supported by NSF award CNS-1560193.","","13","6","7","0","3","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-6732-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","89","109","","10.1145/3318041.3355471","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3318041.3355471","","","21","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO5QB","","Green Submitted, Bronze","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000518634900007","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We model and forecast the volatility performance of the pairs BTC-oil, gold-oil, BTC-S&P GSCI, and gold-GSCI using five bivariate DCC-GARCH family models, two popular forecasting measures (MSE and MAE), the Diebold and Mariano (1995) test, and different risk measures (value-at-risk, expected shortfall, semivariance, and regret) for different portfolios. We find that BTC and gold provide diversification benefits for oil and S&P GSCI. Moreover, by comparing the fitting and forecast performances of the five GARCH models, we find that the standard GARCH model is the best for the gold-oil and BTC-S&P GSCI pairs, while the HYGARCH model is the best for the BTC-oil and gold-S&P GSCI pairs regardless of the time horizon. Finally, we find strong evidence of hedging effectiveness and downside risk reductions, confirming the importance of BTC and gold in oil and S&P GSCI portfolio management.","[Al-Yahyaee, Khamis Hamed; Mensi, Walid] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Coll Econ & Polit Sci, Muscat, Oman; [Al-Jarrah, Idries Mohammad Wanas] Qatar Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Doha, Qatar; [Hamdi, Atef] Al Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ IMSIU, Coll Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Finance & Investment, POB 5701, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Kang, Sang Hoon] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Business Adm, Busan 609735, South Korea; [Kang, Sang Hoon] Univ South Australia, Sch Commerce, Adelaide, SA, Australia","Sultan Qaboos University; Qatar University; Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU); Pusan National University; University of South Australia","Kang, SH (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Business Adm, Busan 609735, South Korea.","yahyai@squ.edu.om; walid.mensi@fsegt.rnu.tn; idries@qu.edu.qa; sanghoonkang@pusan.ac.kr","mensi, walid/R-6139-2016; Al-Jarrah, Idries/GRJ-0970-2022","Al-Jarrah, Idries/0000-0002-5486-7107; Al-Yahyaee, Khamis/0000-0003-2669-0663; Kang, Sanghoon/0000-0002-1236-136X","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017S1A5A8019204]","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","The last author acknowledges financial support from the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2017S1A5A8019204).","","50","26","26","1","27","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1062-9408","1879-0860","","N AM J ECON FINANC","N.

The prevalence of these devices leads to an emerging IoT business model called Device-as-a-service, which enables sensor devices to collect data disseminated to all interested devices. The devices sharing data with other devices could receive some financial reward, such as Bitcoin. However, side-channel attacks, which aim to exploit some information leaked from the IoT devices during data trade execution, are possible since most of the IoT devices are vulnerable to be hacked or compromised. Thus, it is challenging to securely realize data trading in IoT environment due to the information leakage, such as leaking the private key for signing a Bitcoin transaction in Bitcoin system. In this paper, we propose LRCoin, a kind of leakage-resilient cryptocurrency based on bitcoin in which the signature algorithm used for authenticating bitcoin transactions is leakage-resilient. LRCoin is suitable for the scenarios where information leakage is inevitable, such as loT applications. Our core contribution is proposing an efficient bilinear-based continual-leakage-resilient ECDSA signature. We prove the proposed signature algorithm is unforgeable against adaptively chosen messages attack in the generic bilinear group model under the continual leakage setting. Both the theoretical analysis and the implementation demonstrate the practicability of the proposed scheme.","[Yu, Yong; Ding, Yujie; Zhao, Yanqi; Li, Yannan; Zhao, Yi] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Xian 710062, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Du, Xiaojiang] Temple Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Guizani, Mohsen] Univ Idaho, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Shaanxi Normal University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Idaho; University of Idaho","Yu, Y; Li, YN (corresponding author), Shaanxi Normal Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Xian 710062, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.","yuyong@snnu.edu.cn; liyannan2016@163.com","Guizani, Mohsen/AAX-4534-2021; Ding, yu/GWV-1732-2022","Guizani, Mohsen/0000-0002-8972-8094; Li, Yannan/0000-0002-4407-9027","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0802000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61872229]; NSFC Research Fund for International Young Scientists [61750110528]; National Cryptography Development Fund during the 13th Five-year Plan Period [MMJJ20170216]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [GK201702004, 2018CBLY006]","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NSFC Research Fund for International Young Scientists; National Cryptography Development Fund during the 13th Five-year Plan Period; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFB0802000), National Natural Science Foundation of China (61872229), NSFC Research Fund for International Young Scientists (61750110528), National Cryptography Development Fund during the 13th Five-year Plan Period (MMJJ20170216) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (GK201702004, 2018CBLY006).","","30","17","20","2","23","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2327-4662","","","IEEE INTERNET THINGS","IEEE Internet Things J.","JUN","2019","6","3","","","","","4702","4710","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2878406","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2878406","","","9","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","IE8AL","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000472596200060","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Its distributed nature allows currency transactions without a central authority by using cryptographic methods and a data structure called the blockchain. Imagine that you could run the Bitcoin protocol on a quantum computer. What advantages can be had over classical Bitcoin? This is the question we answer here by introducing Quantum Bitcoin which, among other features, has immediate local verification of transactions. This is a major improvement over classical Bitcoin since we no longer need the computationally-intensive and time-consuming method of recording all transactions in the blockchain. Quantum Bitcoin is the first distributed quantum currency, and this paper introduces the necessary tools including a novel two-stage quantum mining process. In addition, we have counterfeiting resistance, fully anonymous and free transactions, and a smaller footprint than classical Bitcoin. In this paper we construct Quantum Bitcoin, a novel currency that draws its inspiration from both Bitcoin and quantum mechanics. As we later show, our new currency has several interesting advantages over existing payment systems, although the drawback is that it requires a quantum computer to function.","[Jogenfors, Jonathan] Linkopings Univ, Inst Syst Tekn, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden","Linkoping University","Jogenfors, J (corresponding author), Linkopings Univ, Inst Syst Tekn, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.","jonathan.jogenfors@liu.se","","","","","","","23","5","6","1","4","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-1328-9","","","","2019","","","","","","","245","252","","","","","","8","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO0IT","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000491257000057","View Full Record in Web of Science"

They offer data consistency, immutability, and auditability, based on the assumption that each participating node locally verifies their entire content. Although their content, currently extending up to a few hundred gigabytes, can be accommodated by dedicated commodity hard disks, downloading it, processing it, and storing it in general-purpose desktop and laptop computers can prove largely impractical. Even worse, this becomes a prohibitive restriction for smartphones, mobile devices, and resource-constrained IoT devices. In this demo, we present an implementation of Dietcoin, a Bitcoin protocol extension that allows nodes to perform secure local verification of Bitcoin transactions with small bandwidth and storage requirements. This demo presents and benchmarks the main features of Dietcoin that are important for today's cryptocurrencies and smart contract systems, but are missing in the current state-of-the-art: (i) allowing resource-constrained devices to verify the correctness of selected blocks locally without having to download the complete ledger; (ii) enabling devices to join a blockchain quickly yet securely, dropping bootstrap time from days down to a matter of seconds; (iii) providing a generic solution that can be applied to other distributed ledgers secured with Proof-of-Work.","[Frey, Davide; Roman, Pierre-Louis; Taiani, Francois] Univ Rennes, INRIA, CNRS, IRISA, Rennes, France; [Makkes, Marc X.] Vrije Univ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Voulgaris, Spyros] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Inria; Universite de Rennes 1; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Athens University of Economics & Business","Frey, D (corresponding author), Univ Rennes, INRIA, CNRS, IRISA, Rennes, France.","davide.frey@inria.fr; m.x.makkes@vu.nl; pierre-louis.roman@irisa.fr; francois.taiani@irisa.fr; voulgaris@aueb.gr","Taïani, François/AAQ-7684-2021","Taïani, François/0000-0002-9692-5678; Roman, Pierre-Louis/0000-0001-5741-1490; Makkes, Marc X./0000-0003-4222-4152; Frey, Davide/0000-0002-6730-5744","Region of Brittany, France; Doctoral school of the University of Brittany Loire (UBL); French National Research Agency (ANR) project SocioPlug [ANR-13-INFR-0003]; Dutch SIDN Fonds [172027]; Dutch Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [629.009.014]; French National Research Agency (ANR) project OBrowser [ANR-16-CE25-0005]","Region of Brittany, France(Region Bretagne); Doctoral school of the University of Brittany Loire (UBL); French National Research Agency (ANR) project SocioPlug(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Dutch SIDN Fonds; Dutch Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); French National Research Agency (ANR) project OBrowser(French National Research Agency (ANR))","This work has been partially funded by the Region of Brittany, France, by the Doctoral school of the University of Brittany Loire (UBL), by the French National Research Agency (ANR) projects SocioPlug under contract ANR-13-INFR-0003 and OBrowser under contract ANR-16-CE25-0005, by the Dutch SIDN Fonds contract 172027 and by the Dutch Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) under contract 629.009.014.","","8","2","2","1","2","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA","2150-8097","","","PROC VLDB ENDOW","Proc.

Current researches on botnet command and control mechanism based on blockchain network suffer from high economic cost, single point of failure, and limited scal-ability. In this paper, we present DUSTBot, a novel P2P botnet model based on Bitcoin transactions to prepare for new cyber threats. Specifically, a covert, duplex, and low-cost command and control (C&C) channel in the Bitcoin network is presented in our work. DUSTBot uses the Bitcoin main network as the downstream channel while using the Bitcoin test-net as the upstream channel. Furthermore, the peer list exchange algorithm based on the Ethereum block hash proposed in this paper is effective against routing table poisoning attack and P2P botnet crawling. The robustness of DUSTBot against node removal is studied through constructing the botnet with a P2P simulator. We deploy the implementation of DUSTBot on cloud platforms to test its feasibility and performance. Moreover, the stealthiness of DUSTBot and the effectiveness of the proposed peer list exchange algorithm are evaluated. The results demonstrate the feasibility, performance, stealthiness, and robustness of DUSTBot. In the end, possible countermeasures are discussed to mitigate similar threats in the future.","[Zhong, Yi; Zhou, Anmin; Zhang, Lei; Jing, Fan] Sichuan Univ, Coll Cybersecur, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Zheng] Sichuan Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Sichuan University; Sichuan University","Zuo, Z (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.","leftzheng@gmail.com","","","National Key Technology R&D Program of China [2017YFB0802900]","National Key Technology R&D Program of China(National Key Technology R&D Program)","This work was supported by the National Key Technology R&D Program of China under Grant 2017YFB0802900.","","61","2","2","0","8","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","DEC 20","2019","14","12","","","","","","","e0226594","10.1371/journal.pone.0226594","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0226594","","","27","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","LP3ZM","31860660","gold, Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000534257500022","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The bitcoin backbone protocol has been analyzed in some depth: the blockchain growth property quantifies the number of blocks added to the blockchain during any time intervals; the blockchain quality property ensures the honest miners always contribute at least a certain fraction of the blockchain; the common prefix property ensures if a block is deep enough, it must be adopted by all honest miners with high probability. The Prism protocol was recently proposed to dramatically improve the blockchain throughput while maintaining the same level of security. Prior analyses of the bitcoin and Prism backbone protocols assume the lifespan of blockchain is finite. This paper presents a streamlined and strengthened analysis in synchronous networks without the finite lifespan assumption. Specifically, the results include a blockchain growth property, a blockchain quality property, and a common prefix property of the bitcoin backbone protocol, as well as the liveness and persistence of the Prism backbone protocol regardless of whether the blockchains have finite lifespan. The properties take the form of explicit expressions in lieu of order optimal results.","[Li, Jing; Guo, Dongning] Northwestern Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Northwestern University","Guo, DN (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.","jingli2015@u.northwestern.edu; dGuo@northwestern.edu","Guo, Dongning/B-7160-2009","","","","","","23","2","2","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2474-0195","","978-1-7281-3151-1","ANN ALLERTON CONF","","","2019","","","","","","","17","24","","","","","","8","Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Telecommunications","BP0MA","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000535355700005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Nodes need to exchange information to maintain the status of the chain but this process consumes significant network resources. Unfortunately, naively reducing the number of messages exchanged can have a negative impact in performance and correctness, as some transactions might not be included in the chain. In this paper, we study the mechanisms of information dissemination used in Bitcoin and propose a set of adaptive mechanisms that lower network resource usage.

In the Bitcoin system, miners provide computing power to confirm transactions and mine blocks in pursuit of transaction fees, while users compete by bidding transaction fees for faster confirmation. This process is in essence analogous to online ad auctions, where advertisers bid for more prominent ad slots. Therefore, inspired by the Generalized Second Price (GSP) mechanism dominantly used in online ad auctions, we propose to adopt the GSP auction model in the Bitcoin transaction confirmation game. Also, we use weighted fees as the new ranking basis, which can be calculated by user-submitted fees, transaction size, quality scores and virtual fees accumulated from the waiting time. We show that the formulated static GSP transaction fee auction with complete information has a unique Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium. Then, we discuss the impacts of quality scores and virtual fees on users' equilibrium fee decisions and payoffs. Finally, computational experiments are designed to validate our theoretical models and analysis. Our research findings indicate that this novel GSP mechanism is superior to the currently adopted GFP mechanism, and can help users save fees. Besides, quality scores and virtual fees are also proven to be effective on reducing users' paid fees. Moreover, the design of virtual fees allows all transactions to be processed more efficiently in a uniform pipeline, and the interests of transactions with and without associated fees are taken into consideration.","[Li, Juanjuan] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Automat, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Li, Juanjuan; Yuan, Yong; Wang, Fei-Yue] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, State Key Lab Management & Control Complex Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Li, Juanjuan; Yuan, Yong; Wang, Fei-Yue] Qingdao Acad Intelligent Ind, Qingdao 266109, Shandong, Peoples R China","Beijing Institute of Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Automation, CAS","Yuan, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, State Key Lab Management & Control Complex Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.","juanjuan.li@ia.ac.cn; yong.yuan@ia.ac.cn; feiyue.wang@ia.ac.cn","Yuan, Yuan/GVS-5120-2022","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61533019, 71702182]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","We gratefully acknowledge the funding supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (#61533019, #71702182).","","30","16","18","7","41","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0167-9236","1873-5797","","DECIS SUPPORT SYST","Decis.

In this paper, we investigate the performance of block propagation in a Bitcoin-like peer-to-peer distribution network, and highlight the impact of the Nakamoto consensus protocol on the dynamics of blockchain growth. We use a simulated network with nodes located in different geographic regions, each with its own propagation characteristics; the values of network parameters are chosen to match available data for the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network. We show that the latency of block propagation is mainly affected by the mean round-trip time; that forks occur more often when mean round-trip time is longer, and that the ratio of the number of nodes opting for one or the other of competing blocks as the main chain tip can occur in almost any ratio; finally, that the mean time to resolve a fork is approximately equal to block inter-arrival time.","[Misic, Vojislav B.; Misic, Jelena] Ryerson Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Chang, Xiaolin] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China","Toronto Metropolitan University; Beijing Jiaotong University","Misic, VB (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada.","","","","","","","","24","10","11","0","1","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-4693-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","212","219","","10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00035","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00035","","","8","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO8PX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000528931600026","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Besides supporting the recording of crypto-currency transactions blockchains are also being exploited as mediums of recording arbitrary chunks of data. One technique for embedding such data on the public Bitcoin blockchain is using the OP_RETURN opcode creating an unspendable transaction. In this paper, we leverage data retrieved from such transactions to reveal the identity of the transacting entity. In more detail, we cast the problem of identity discovery as a classification problem. An empirical evaluation using various supervised classification models (from Naive Bayes to deep learning) yield up to 99.98% classification accuracy.

In this artificial market model two kinds of agents, Chartists and Random traders, perform trading. Chartists trade through the application of trading rules. Specifically, a part of Chartists trades applying the best sets of trading rules selected by a genetic algorithm that simulates a trading system, based on four technical analysis indicators, searching for parameters of each indicator that guarantee the highest profits in the training period; the remaining part trades applying trading rules choosing their parameters in a random way. On the contrary random trader's trade without applying any trading strategy, issuing in a random way sell or buy orders.

Disagreements in blockchain communities often lead to splits in the blockchain and the community. For example, disagreements within the Bitcoin community on increasing the block size led to the blockchain split and creation of Bitcoin Cash. We build on actor-network theory to investigate blockchain split as a translation process, and employ case study methodology to examine Bitcoin splits. We identify several human actors, such as miners, developers, merchants, and investors, as well as non-human actors including ideologies, exchanges and computer programs involved in Bitcoin splits. Our results show that actor heterogeneity, that is, the complex constellation of diverse actors, plays a key role in blockchain splits. We further describe how the human and non-human actors' fluid moves into micro and macro positions in the network affect the development of the split. We also discuss the role of these actors and their engagement in forming micro and macro agencies in blockchain splits. Our study adds to the understanding of actor behavior and network dynamics in decentralized information systems such as blockchain and open source software.","[Islam, A. K. M.

The ability to access a super computer is now available to any user with a credit card. Wide adoption has fueled the rise of many new industries and disruptive technologies. Building competitive, highly performing systematic algorithms is within reach for even small, bootstrapped organizations, but the availability of cheap computing power alone is insufficient to be highly successful. What matters is the amount of data an organization can access and analyze in a time sensitive fashion. We analyze the intersection of Big Data analytics and cloud computing with a focus on creating investment algorithmic strategies to trade different cryptocurrencies. It is now possible to access high quality, inexpensive time series data sets. However, the exponential increase in the size of data sets, as well as the number of data sets required makes analysis infeasible for even very powerful desktop computers. Specifically, this paper will delve into the application of Machine Learning, its unique demands, and its application to modeling cryptocurrencies through the use of Big Data and cloud computing leveraging AWS and PaperSpace. We will explore the unique approach of using a circuit of ML algorithms to improve predictive power and its dependence on cloud computing structure.","[Mathai-Davis, Stephen] Quantamize, Jersey City, NJ 07310 USA; [Trudeau, Edward] Catholic Univ Amer, Inst Res, Washington, DC 20064 USA","Catholic University of America","Mathai-Davis, S (corresponding author), Quantamize, Jersey City, NJ 07310 USA.","smd@quantamize.com; trudeaue@cua.edu","","","","","","","0","0","0","0","1","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-3101-6","","","","2019","","","","","","","25","30","","10.1109/CloudSummit47114.2019.00011","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CloudSummit47114.2019.00011","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR4QG","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000652194400005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, the verification of blockchain payments requires the user to download and process the entire chain which can be infeasible for resource-constrained devices like mobile phones. To address this problem, most major blockchain systems support so called lightweight clients that outsource most of the computational and storage burden to full blockchain nodes. However, such verification leaks critical information about clients' transactions, thus defeating user privacy that is often considered one of the main goals of decentralized cryptocurrencies. In this paper, we propose a new approach to protect the privacy of light clients in Bitcoin. Our main idea is to leverage the trusted execution capabilities of commonly available SGX enclaves. We design and implement a system called BITE where enclaves on full nodes serve privacy-preserving requests from light clients. However, as we will show, naive processing of client requests from within SGX enclaves still leaks client's addresses and transactions. BITE therefore integrates several private information retrieval and side-channel protection techniques at critical parts of the system. We show that BITE provides significantly improved privacy protection for light clients without compromising the performance of the assisting full nodes.","[Matetic, Sinisa; Wuest, Karl; Schneider, Moritz; Kostiainen, Kari; Capkun, Srdjan] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Karame, Ghassan] NEC Labs, Princeton, NJ USA","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; NEC Corporation","Matetic, S (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.","","Wüst, Karl/ABH-1743-2020; Karame, Ghassan/AAM-7197-2021","Karame, Ghassan/0000-0002-2828-4071","Zurich Information Security and Privacy Center (ZISC)","Zurich Information Security and Privacy Center (ZISC)","The research work leading to these results has been supported by Zurich Information Security and Privacy Center (ZISC).

As the first cryptocurrency created, the behavior of this new asset is characterized by great volatility. The lack of a proper definition or classification under existing theory exacerbates this property in such a way that explosive periods followed by a rapid decline have been observed along the series, meaning bubble episodes. By detecting the periods in which a bubble rises and collapses, it is possible to study the statistical properties of such segments. In particular, adjusting a theoretical distribution may help to determine better strategies to hedge against these episodes. The NIG is an appropriate candidate not only because of its heavy-tailed property but also because it has been proven to be closed under convolution, a characteristic that can be implemented to measure multivariate value at risk. Using data on the price of BTC with respect to seven of the main global currencies, the NIG was able to fit every time segment despite the bubble behavior. In the out-of-sample tests, the NIG was proven to have an adjustment similar to that of a generalized hyperbolic (GH) distribution. This result could serve as a starting point for future studies regarding the statistical properties of cryptocurrencies as well as their multivariate distributions.","[Antonio Nunez, Jose; Contreras-Valdez, Mario I.; Franco-Ruiz, Carlos A.] Tecnol Monterrey, Dept Finance, EGADE Business Sch, Mexico City, DF, Mexico","Tecnologico de Monterrey","Nunez, JA (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Dept Finance, EGADE Business Sch, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.","janm@tec.mx","","Contreras-Valdez, Mario Ivan/0000-0003-4870-4376; Nunez, Jose/0000-0002-9751-2306","","","","","45","17","17","1","6","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","MAR 22","2019","14","3","","","","","","","e0213919","10.1371/journal.pone.0213919","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0213919","","","22","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","HP9GF","30901371","gold, Green Submitted, Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000462000400023","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Considerable amounts of data accordingly need to be downloaded and stored at decentralized nodes to carry out meaningful validations. For the Bitcoin blockchain, approximately 197 GB must currently be downloaded and processed by any node aiming to fully verify the correctness of stored transactions. This represents an emerging problem with respect to resource-constrained thin clients that lack the required download or storage capacities, but with which meaningful validations still need to be carried out. This problem will gain even more relevance in the future, as blockchain technology is applied to new domains such as the Internet of Things (IoT) that necessitate the use of thin clients. We address this emerging problem by proposing a novel compressible blockchain architecture. In our proposal, we use a snapshot-based approach, to create snapshots of the blockchain at regular intervals and store them in blocks. These blocks are chained, forming a second blockchain that is linked to the primary chain. In this way, the amount of data that needs to be downloaded and stored by decentralized nodes is reduced considerably, while the full validation of the entire blockchain still remains feasible. In this paper, we describe the proposed compressible blockchain architecture in detail. We conducted evaluations that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution and show its advantages over related approaches introduced in the literature. Overall, our design can be used to reduce the size of the blockchain by up to 93%, facilitating secure blockchain-based applications even on resource-constrained thin clients such as IoT devices.","[Marsalek, Alexander] A SIT, Graz, Austria; [Zefferer, Thomas] A SIT Plus GmbH, Vienna, Austria; [Fasllija, Edona] Graz Univ Technol, Graz, Austria; [Ziegler, Dominik] Know Ctr GmbH, Graz, Austria","Graz University of Technology","Marsalek, A (corresponding author), A SIT, Graz, Austria.","Alexander.Marsalek@a-sit.at; Thomas.Zefferer@a-sit.at; Edona.Fasllija@iaik.tugraz.at; Dominik.Ziegler@tugraz.at","","","","","","","17","9","9","0","2","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","2324-9013","","978-1-7281-2776-7","IEEE TRUST","","","2019","","","","","","","626","633","","10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00089","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00089","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP8TQ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000567324100076","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In the first step, an IGARCH (1,1)-DCC (1,1) multivariate GARCH model is estimated to quantify the nature of volatility spillovers. From GARCH results, it is seen that there is statistically significant volatility spillover from Bitcoin to Ethereum and Litecoin during the period of analysis. The conditional correlation measures point towards the possibility of moderate return co-movement among the crypto-currency returns. The conditional covariance measures show negligible volatility spillover during the initial periods and provide evidence towards increased volatility spillover after 2017. Wavelet coherence measures shows evidence towards correlation among the crypto-currencies to be persistent across the short run, while the pairwise wavelet cross-spectral analysis confirms the findings obtained from conditional covariance measures. It is found that other crypto-currencies are influenced by fluctuations in bitcoin prices. Overall, the results indicate the possibility of turbulence in the crypto-currency markets and point towards the possibility of herding behaviour in crypto-currency markets. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach In doing so, the symmetric informative analysis is estimated by applying the generalised auto-regressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) (1,1) model, whereas asymmetric informative or leverage effects analysis is estimated by exponential GARCH (1,1), asymmetric power ARCH (1,1) and threshold GARCH (1,1) models. In addition, the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity in mean (GARCH-M (1,1)) was applied to examine whether the risk-return trade-off phenomenon was persistent in crypto-currencies market. Findings The main findings indicate that bitcoin market return or volatility is symmetric informative and has a long memory to persist in the future. Furthermore, the sympatric volatility is found to be more sensitive to its past values (lagged) than to the new shock of the market values. However, asymmetric informative response of volatility to the negative and the positive shocks do not exist in the bitcoin market or, in other words, there is no leverage effect. This suggests that the bitcoin market is in harmony with the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) with respect to the asymmetric information and violated the EMH with regard to the symmetric information. Hence, the market price or return of bitcoin currency could not be predicted by simply exercising such past market information in the short-run investment. In addition, the estimated coefficient of conditional variance or risk premium (lambda) in the mean equation of CHARCH-M (1,1) model is positive however, statistically insignificant. This indicates the absence of risk-return trade-off, in which case the higher market risk will not essentially lead to higher market returns. This paper has proposed that an investment in the crypto-currency market is more appropriate for risk-averse investors than risk takers. Originality/value The findings of the study will provide investors with necessary information about the bitcoin market price efficiency, hedging effectiveness and risk management.","[Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah; Alhabshi, Syed Musa; Haron, Razali] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, IIUM Inst Islamic Banking & Finance, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","International Islamic University Malaysia","Othman, AHA (corresponding author), Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, IIUM Inst Islamic Banking & Finance, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.","anwar315a@yahoo.com","Haron, Razali/AAG-3205-2019; Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah/U-3214-2019","Haron, Razali/0000-0003-0415-4093; Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah/0000-0001-5759-8216","","","","","55","5","5","2","18","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1757-6385","1757-6393","","J FINAN ECON POLICY","J.

With the introduction of quantum computers, recent research is focusing on developing alternative algorithms which are supposed to withstand attacks from quantum computers. One of such alternatives is the Hash-based Digital Signature Schemes. Chosen hash-based signature schemes over classical algorithms is because their security is on the hash function used and that they are metaheuristic in nature. This research work presents basic analysis and the background understanding of Stateful Hash-based Signature Schemes, particularly the Lamport One-Time Signature Scheme, Winternitz One-Time Signature Scheme, and the Merkle Signature Scheme. The three schemes selected are stateful, hence has common features and are few-time hash-based signature schemes. The selected Stateful Hash-based Digital Signature Schemes were analyzed based on their respective key generation, signature generation, signature verification, and their security levels. Practical working examples were given for better understanding. With the analyses, Merkle Signature Scheme proves to be the best candidate to be used in the Bitcoin Proof of Work protocol because of its security and its advantage of signing many messages.","[Noel, Moses Dogonyaro; Waziri, Onomza Victor; Abdulhamid, Muhammad Shafii; Ojeniyi, Adebayo Joseph] Fed Univ Technol, Cyber Secur Sci Dept, Minna, Nigeria","","Noel, MD (corresponding author), Fed Univ Technol, Cyber Secur Sci Dept, Minna, Nigeria.","moses.noel@futminna.edu.ng; victor.waziri@futminna.edu.ng; shafii.abdulhamid@futminna.edu.ng; ojeniyia@futminna.edu.ng","Dogonyaro, Moses Noel/ABF-5784-2020; ABDULHAMID, Shafi'i Muhammad/J-4288-2016","Dogonyaro, Moses Noel/0000-0002-6774-6144; ABDULHAMID, Shafi'i Muhammad/0000-0001-9196-9447","","","","","14","0","0","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2640-6802","2640-6799","978-1-7281-5160-1","INT CONF ELECT COMP","","","2019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BP8HO","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000565653600011","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Among the closed-form characteristics that we derive for this model is the busy period distribution which, counterintuitively, does not depend on the arrival rate. We explain this by exploiting the equivalence between two specific service disciplines, which is also used to derive the model's stationary distribution. Next to these closed-form results, the second major contribution concerns an asymptotic result: a fluid limit in the presence of service delays. Since fluid limits arise under scalings of the law-of-large-numbers type, they are usually deterministic, but in the setting of the model discussed in this paper the fluid limit is random (more specifically, of growth-collapse type).","[Frolkova, Maria; Mandjes, Michel] Univ Amsterdam, Korteweg de Vries Inst Math, Sci Pk 105-107, NL-1098 XG Amsterdam, Netherlands","University of Amsterdam","Frolkova, M (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Korteweg de Vries Inst Math, Sci Pk 105-107, NL-1098 XG Amsterdam, Netherlands.","maria.frolkova@gmail.com","","","NWO Gravitation Project NETWORKS [024.002.003]","NWO Gravitation Project NETWORKS","This research was partly funded by the NWO Gravitation Project NETWORKS, Grant no. 024.002.003.

We employ fractional integration approach in our analysis of persistence, while a more recent fractional cointegration technique in VAR set-up, proposed by Johansen (2008), is used to investigate inter-dependence in pricing of the paired cryptocurrencies. Having partitioned the series into periods before and after the 2017/2018 cryptocurrency price crash, as determined by Bitcoin pricing, we obtain some interesting results. Higher persistence of price shocks is observed after the crash, which is probably due to speculative transactions among cryptocurrency traders, and more evidences of non-mean reversions are revealed, implying chances of further price fall in cryptocurrencies. Cointegration relationships between bitcoin and alternative coins exist in both periods, with weak correlations observed mostly in the post-crash period. Our results further indicate the possibility of market efficiency between pair of cryptocurrency. Generally, we hope the findings will serve as guide to investors in cryptocurrency markets.

Payment-channel networks (PCNs) have emerged as an interesting solution to the scalability issue and are currently deployed by popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. While PCNs do increase the transaction throughput by processing payments off-chain and using the blockchain only as a dispute arbitrator, they unfortunately require high collateral (i.e., they lock coins for a non-constant time along the payment path) and are restricted to payments in a path from sender to receiver. These issues have severe consequences in practice. The high collateral enables denial of-service attacks that hamper the throughput and utility of the PCN. Moreover, the limited functionality hinders the applicability of current PCNs in many important application scenarios. Unfortunately, current proposals do not solve either of these issues, or they require Turing-complete language support, which severely limit their applicability. In this work, we present AMCU, the first protocol for atomic multi-channel updates and reduced collateral that is compatible with Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies with reduced scripting capabilities). We provide a formal model in the Universal Composability framework and show that AMCU realizes it, thus demonstrating that AMCU achieves atomicity and value privacy. Moreover, the reduced collateral mitigates the consequences of griefing attacks in PCNs while the (multi-payment) atomicity achieved by AMCU opens the door to new applications such as credit rebalancing and crowdfunding that are not possible otherwise. Moreover, our evaluation results demonstrate that AMCU has a performance in line with that of the Lightning Network (the most widely deployed PCN) and thus is ready to be deployed in practice.","[Egger, Christoph] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany; [Moreno-Sanchez, Pedro; Maffei, Matteo] TU Wien, Vienna, Austria","University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Technische Universitat Wien","Egger, C (corresponding author), Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.","","Egger, Christoph/AAP-2307-2021","Egger, Christoph/0000-0002-3745-5442; Moreno-Sanchez, Pedro/0000-0003-2315-7839","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research [771527-BROWSEC]; Netidee through the projectEtherTrust [2158]; Netidee through PROFET [P31621]; Austrian Research Promotion Agency through the Bridge-1 project PR4DLT [13808694]; COMET K1 SBA, ABC; Chaincode Labs; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) through the Lisa Meitner program; German research foundation (DFG) through the collaborative research center 1223; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the project PROMISE [16KIS0763]; State of Bavaria at the Nuremberg Campus of Technology (NCT)","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research(European Research Council (ERC)); Netidee through the projectEtherTrust; Netidee through PROFET; Austrian Research Promotion Agency through the Bridge-1 project PR4DLT; COMET K1 SBA, ABC; Chaincode Labs; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) through the Lisa Meitner program(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); German research foundation (DFG) through the collaborative research center 1223(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the project PROMISE(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); State of Bavaria at the Nuremberg Campus of Technology (NCT)","This work has been partially supported by the the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research (grant agreement 771527-BROWSEC); by Netidee through the projectEtherTrust (grant agreement 2158) and PROFET (grant agreement P31621); by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency through the Bridge-1 project PR4DLT (grant agreement 13808694); by COMET K1 SBA, ABC; by Chaincode Labs; by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) through the Lisa Meitner program; by the German research foundation (DFG) through the collaborative research center 1223; by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the project PROMISE (16KIS0763); and by the State of Bavaria at the Nuremberg Campus of Technology (NCT).

In any event, they are too big to ignore. The purpose of this article is to contribute to the understanding of cryptocurrencies in an individual and in a portfolio context. The study is based on daily closing prices of leading cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and Dash) and fiat currencies (EUR, GBP, CHF, CAD, and JPY), all measured against USD. The analysis is threefold: First, the authors analyze basic statistical properties, such as correlation and autocorrelation of returns. Second, they perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS test) and a variance ratio test (VRT) with heteroscedasticity adjustment. Third, they solve more than 4,800 optimization problems to analyze the impact of individual crypto- and fiat currencies on portfolio diversification. Among other findings, the authors find that Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, CAD, JPY, and EUR contribute most to reduce the variance of a mixed portfolio. In a portfolio consisting of cryptocurrencies only, Bitcoin and Ripple have the largest diversification effect. The findings provide insights for investors who focus on minimum variance portfolios or, more generally, for investors who seek to reduce return volatility exposure, as well as for monetary authorities, cryptocurrency issuers, and providers of market infrastructure.","[Ehlers, Stefan; Gauer, Kolja] DAX Listed Co, Frankfurt, Germany; [Gauer, Kolja] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Business Sch, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Edinburgh Napier University","Ehlers, S (corresponding author), DAX Listed Co, Frankfurt, Germany.","fam.ehlers@t-online.de; kolja.gauer@napier.ac.uk","","","","","","","23","3","3","3","21","INST INVESTOR INC","NEW YORK","225 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10003 USA","1520-3255","2168-8435","","J ALTERN INVEST","J.

For this purpose, a small analysis was carried out on the nature, operation, and characteristics of cryptocurrencies. Subsequently, from the point of view of the Spanish tax system, the tax implications of the use, actions, and operations carried out with this virtual medium were discussed. The most recent information derived from the binding inquiries issued by the general directorate of taxes in Spain, an institution under the Ministry of Finance, was reviewed. This article analyzed whether the activities related to Bitcoin should be declared for the purposes of personal income tax, property tax, inheritance tax and finally, in the tax on transmissions of assets and documented legal acts. Finally, special mention was made of activities, such as the mining of Bitcoins in Bitcoin farms and the exploitation of websites for buying and selling cryptocurrencies and vending machines. Other collateral situations were also analyzed, such as the system to be used.","[Nanez Alonso, Sergio Luis] Catholic Univ Avila, Social & Legal Sci Fac, Avila 05005, Spain","Santa Teresa Jesus Catholic University of Avila","Alonso, SLN (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Avila, Social & Legal Sci Fac, Avila 05005, Spain.","sergio.nanez@ucavila.es","Alonso, Sergio Luis Náñez/AAJ-9071-2020; Alonso, Sergio/GVR-8346-2022","Alonso, Sergio Luis Náñez/0000-0001-5353-2017; ","","","","","16","8","8","3","10","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2075-471X","","LAWS-BASEL","Laws","SEP","2019","8","3","","","","","","","16","10.3390/laws8030016","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/laws8030016","","","13","Law","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Government & Law","VK1FZ","","Green Submitted, gold, Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000659967900003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This framework is based on deep learning (DL). We compare the performance of our approach to two classical baseline methods in the case of the prediction of unstable Bitcoin prices in the OkCoin market and show that the baseline approaches are easily biased by class imbalance, whereas our model mitigates this problem. We also show that the classification performance of our method expressed as the F-measure substantially exceeds the odds of a uniform random process with three outcomes, proving that extraction of deterministic patterns for trend classification, and hence market prediction, is possible to some degree. The profit rates based on RSM outperformed those based on LSTM, although they did not exceed those of the buy-and-hold strategy within the testing data period, and thus do not provide a basis for algorithmic trading.","[Shintate, Takuya; Pichl, Lukas] Int Christian Univ, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Osawa 3-10-2, Mitaka, Tokyo 1818585, Japan","International Christian University","Pichl, L (corresponding author), Int Christian Univ, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Osawa 3-10-2, Mitaka, Tokyo 1818585, Japan.","g196729a@icu.ac.jp; lukas@icu.ac.jp","","","","","","","34","25","25","2","21","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

Contrary to prior expectations, recent research has shown that participants of the protocol (the so-called miners) are not always incentivized to follow the protocol. We study the game induced by one such attack -the pool block withholding attack - in which mining pools (groups of miners) attack other mining pools. We focus on the case of two pools attacking each other, with potentially other mining power in the system. We show that this game always admits a pure Nash equilibrium, and its pure price of anarchy, which intuitively measures how much computational power can be wasted due to attacks in an equilibrium, is at most 3. We conjecture, and prove in special cases, that it is in fact at most 2. Our simulations provide compelling evidence for this conjecture, and show that players can quickly converge to the equilibrium by following best response strategies.","[Alkalay-Houlihan, Colleen; Shah, Nisarg] Univ Toronto, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada","University of Toronto","Alkalay-Houlihan, C (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada.","colleen@cs.toronto.edu; nisarg@cs.toronto.edu","","","","","","","14","6","6","0","0","ASSOC ADVANCEMENT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE","PALO ALTO","2275 E BAYSHORE RD, STE 160, PALO ALTO, CA 94303 USA","2159-5399","2374-3468","978-1-57735-809-1","AAAI CONF ARTIF INTE","","","2019","","","","","","","1724","1731","","","","","","8","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BN6IS","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000485292601090","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The main aim of this paper is to examine dependence relationships among five well-known cryptocurrencies-Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Stella-by a copula directional dependence (CDD). By employing a neural network autoregression model to avoid the serial dependence in each individual cryptocurrency, we generate residuals of the fitted models with time series of daily log-returns in percentage of the five cryptocurrencies and then we apply a Gaussian copula marginal beta regression model to the residuals to explore the CDD. The results show that the CDD from Bitcoin to Litecoin is highest among all ordered directional dependencies and the CDDs from Ethereum to the other four cryptocurrencies are relatively higher than the CDDs to Ethereum from those cryptocurrencies. This finding implies that the return shocks of Bitcoin have the most effect on Litecoin and the return shocks of Ethereum relatively influence the shocks on the other four cryptocurrencies instead of being affected by them. This allows investors to build the market-timing strategies by observing the directional flow of return shocks among cryptocurrencies.","[Hyun, Steve] Univ South Carolina Upstate, Div Math & Comp Sci, Spartanburg, SC 29303 USA; [Lee, Jimin] Univ North Carolina Asheville, Dept Math, Asheville, NC 28804 USA; [Kim, Jong-Min] Univ Minnesota, Stat Discipline, Div Sci & Math, Morris, MN 56267 USA; [Jun, Chulhee] Bloomsburg Univ, Dept Finance, Ziegler Coll Business, Bloomsburg, PA 17815 USA","University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina - Asheville; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Morris; Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania","Jun, C (corresponding author), Bloomsburg Univ, Dept Finance, Ziegler Coll Business, Bloomsburg, PA 17815 USA.","cjun@bloomu.edu","","JUN, Chulhee/0000-0002-4663-3992","","","","","36","10","10","1","6","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

The Amihud's illiquidity ratio is employed in order to measure the liquidity of these digital assets. Findings indicate that the most popular cryptocurrencies exhibit higher levels of liquidity during stressed periods. Thereby, it is revealed that investors' preferences for trading during highly risky times are favorable for well-known virtual currencies in the detriment of less-known ones. This enhances findings of relevant literature about strong and persistent positive or negative herding behavior of investors based on Bitcoin, Ethereum and highly-capitalized cryptocurrencies in general.

Also, the cryptocurrency market is very volatile and lack strict governing bodies and regulators across regions making it more complex and challenging to predict the prices.

This key innovation enables cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to operate in a decentralized manner with no intermediaries such as financial institutions. But the blockchain can be used to record things other than cryptocurrency transactions. While many of the concepts of Bitcoin build on what have been around since the 1980s and 1990s, the designer(s) of it have made important assumptions that make it work along with the use of an incentive protocol, leading to a major breakthrough from traditional academic thinking.

In this paper, taking Bitcoin and Ethereum for instances, we propose an entropy method in information theory to quantify the decentralization for them. Using the information entropy, we calculate the discrete degrees of blocks mined and address balances to quantify the degrees of decentralization for Bitcoin and Ethereum systems, and the results of calculations indicate that Bitcoin's mining is more approximately 12% decentralized than Ethereum with full samples, and Bitcoin's wealth is more approximately 9.2% decentralized than Ethereum with 10,000 samples. Our method can be used to evaluate the degree of decentralization for any blockchain system.","[Wu, Keke] Shenzhen Inst Informat Technol, Shenzhen 518172, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Peng, Bo; Xie, Hua; Huang, Zhen] Shenzhen Silico Design Technol Co LTD, Shenzhen 518057, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Shenzhen Institute of Information Technology","Wu, KK (corresponding author), Shenzhen Inst Informat Technol, Shenzhen 518172, Guangdong, Peoples R China.","wukk@sziit.edu.cn; pengbo@silico.design; xiehua@silico.design; huangzhen@silico.design","","","Guangdong Natural Science Foundation [2018A030313746]; Basic Research Project of Shenzhen [JCYJ20170817114239348]","Guangdong Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Basic Research Project of Shenzhen","This work was supported by the Guangdong Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. 2018A030313746), and the Basic Research Project of Shenzhen (Grant No. JCYJ20170817114239348).","","9","11","12","0","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2377-8431","","978-1-7281-1190-2","IEEE INT CONF ELECTR","","","2019","","","","","","","287","292","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BO1PF","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000501822200065","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The price of bitcoin is characterized with high volatility, which makes firms that hold large amounts of it prone to risks. To prevent those risks and to gain insights into its behavior and trading strategies, it is necessary to forecast bitcoin volatility. In that context, this study reviews the impact of different factors on BTC price, returns and volatility. Moreover, it examines the sensitivity of GARCH family models to standardized residuals distributions in forecasting BTC volatility based on the leverage effect. Then, it compares the best GARCH-type model against the best ANN model with respect to short-term and long-term horizons. Results outline that APARCH, TGARCH and EGARCH are very sensitive to standardized residuals distributions, such that TGARCH run with the normal distribution is the best model that captures BTC volatility. Further, MLP outperforms all the parametric and nonparametric models, while its accuracy weakens with the level of forecasting horizons. Consequently, nonparametric models prevail parametric models in BTC volatility forecasting due to their high degree of flexibility and strong generalization abilities, whereas MLP is only effective in short-term forecasting.","[Khaldi, Rohaifa; El Afia, Abdellatif; Chiheb, Raddouane] Mohammed V Univ, ENSIAS, Rabat, Morocco","Mohammed V University in Rabat","Khaldi, R (corresponding author), Mohammed V Univ, ENSIAS, Rabat, Morocco.","rohaifa.khaldi@gmail.com; a.elafia@um5s.net.ma; r.chiheb@um5s.net.ma","","El Afia, Abdellatif/0000-0003-1921-4431; Khaldi, Rohaifa/0000-0001-6224-2206","CNRST [67UM52016]","CNRST","Funding was provided by CNRST (Grant No. 67UM52016).","","86","4","5","0","8","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","2192-6352","2192-6360","","PROG ARTIF INTELL","Prog.

Discussions, too often, make assertions that the trustless nature of blockchain technologies enables and actively promotes their suitability-there being no need to trust third parties or centralised control. Yet humans need to be able to trust systems, and others with whom the system enables transactions. In this paper, we highlight that understanding this need for trust is critical for the development of blockchain-based systems. Through an online study with 125 users of the most wellknown of blockchain based systems - the cryptocurrency Bitcoin - we uncover that human and institutional aspects of trust are pervasive. Our analysis highlights that, when designing future blockchain-based technologies, we ought to not only consider computational trust but also the wider eco-system, how trust plays a part in users engaging/disengaging with such eco-systems and where design choices impact upon trust. From this, we distill a set of guidelines for software engineers developing blockchain-based systems for societal applications.","[Craggs, Barnaby; Rashid, Awais] Univ Bristol, Dept Comp Sci, Bristol, Avon, England","University of Bristol","Craggs, B (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Dept Comp Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.","barney.craggs@bristol.ac.uk; awais.rashid@bristol.ac.uk","","","UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) as part of PETRAS: Cybersecurity of the Internet of Things Research Hub [EP/N023234/1]; HighWire post-disciplinary Doctoral Training Centre [EP/G037582/1]; HoSEM: HouseholdSupplier Energy Market [EP/P031838/1]","UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) as part of PETRAS: Cybersecurity of the Internet of Things Research Hub; HighWire post-disciplinary Doctoral Training Centre; HoSEM: HouseholdSupplier Energy Market","This work has been funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) as part of PETRAS: Cybersecurity of the Internet of Things Research Hub (grant no EP/N023234/1), the HighWire post-disciplinary Doctoral Training Centre (grant no EP/G037582/1), and HoSEM: HouseholdSupplier Energy Market (grant no EP/P031838/1).","","54","7","7","2","7","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-1762-1","","","","2019","","","","","","","21","30","","10.1109/ICSE-SEIS.2019.00011","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSE-SEIS.2019.00011","","","10","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Social Issues","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Computer Science; Social Issues","BP9RO","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000570739900003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Previous research shows that mining pools would launch DDoS attacks on others when the size is relatively large. However, no mining pools claimed responsibility to any DDoS attacks on mining pools till now. In this paper, we revise the previous game-theoretic analysis model by adding DDoS defense cost. With the assumption that the whole computing resource of any mining pool consists of mining, defense and attack, we obtain some interesting conclusions. (1) If the failure probability of DDoS attack is high, then mining pools would have a greater incentive to stay peacefully. (2) Increasing the computing resource in mining is always the primary choice for mining pools, no matter whether they are launching DDoS attacks or under DDoS attacks.","[Zheng, Rongxin; Ying, Cuiwen; Shao, Jun; Wei, Guiyi; Kong, Jianmin; Ren, Yekun; Zhang, Hang; Hou, Weiguang] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Engn, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Yan, Hongyang] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Cyber Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Zhejiang Gongshang University; Guangzhou University","Wei, GY (corresponding author), Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Engn, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.","weigy@zjgsu.edu.cn","","","Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang [LR18F020003]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1709217]","Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their invaluable comments.

Rather than issuing a token with both utility and financing attributes at the very beginning, a utility token with a warrant attribute is introduced to stimulate and facilitate the value exchange between miners and other participants. After the business has become mature enough, token holders can redeem certain security tokens and start to enjoy dividends and other rights as a shareholder. In this way, speculation and fraud risks can be dramatically reduced, benefiting both project developers and investors.","[Cao, Yixin; Xu, Zhaoye; Wu, Xiaochuan] Zhong An Informat & Technol Serv Co Ltd, Shanghai 200002, Peoples R China","","Cao, YX (corresponding author), Zhong An Informat & Technol Serv Co Ltd, Shanghai 200002, Peoples R China.","caoyixin@zhongan.io; xuzhaoye@zhongan.io; wuxiaochuan@zhongan.io","","","","","","","20","0","0","1","7","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","","978-1-4503-6268-9","","","","2019","","","","","","","49","54","","10.1145/3320154.3320159","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3320154.3320159","","","6","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BN3ZS","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000481600300009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Recently, the concept of off-chain payments is introduced that led to the idea of establishing a payment network called Lightning Network (LN). Off-chain links provide the ability to do transactions without writing to Blockchain. However, LN's design still favors fees and is creating hub nodes that defeat the purpose of Blockchain. In addition, it is still not reliable as not all the transactions are guaranteed to be transmitted to their destinations. If current retailers would like to use it, these problems might hinder its adoption. To address this issue, in this paper, we advocate creating a private payment network among a given set of retailers that will serve their business needs, just like the idea of private Blockchains. The goal is to build a pure peer-to-peer topology that will eliminate the need for relays and increase the robustness of payments. Using off-chain links as edges and retailers as nodes, the problem is formulated as a multi-flow commodity problem where transactions represent the commodities from various sources to destinations. As the multi-flow commodity problem is NY-Complete, we propose a heuristic approach that utilizes Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in a dynamic way by updating the edge weights when new payment paths are to be found. The order of transactions is randomized to provide fairness among the retailers. The evaluations indicate that the proposed heuristic comes close to an optimal solution while providing scalability and user privacy.","[Erdin, Enes; Cebe, Mumin; Akkaya, Kemal; Uluagac, Selcuk] Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Bulutt, Eyuphan] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA USA","State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Virginia Commonwealth University","Erdin, E (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA.","eerdi001@fiu.edu; mcebe@fiu.edu; kakkaya@fiu.edu; ebulut@vcu.edu; suluagae@fiu.edu","Erdin, Enes/AAY-8226-2020; Uluagac, Selcuk/P-9997-2015","Cebe, Mumin/0000-0003-2843-8904; Uluagac, Selcuk/0000-0002-9823-3464","","","","","19","2","2","0","2","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-4693-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","294","301","","10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00046","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00046","","","8","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO8PX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000528931600037","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Moreover, in the case of Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple, and Litecoin, asymmetric past shocks have a significant effect in the current conditional variance. Similar results are obtained for the cryptocurrencies' conditional covariances, which are significantly affected by cross products of previous error terms and past covariance terms while capturing asymmetric effects of past shocks accordingly. It is also shown that time-varying conditional correlations exist and are mostly positive. Finally, the cryptocurrencies' volatility dynamics are found to be responsive to major news, with Bitcoin and Litecoin exhibiting one structural breakpoint each in the conditional variance. The results improve our understanding of interdependencies between cryptocurrencies as well as of the events that affect their volatility dynamics and thus have important implications for both cryptocurrency users and investors.","[Katsiampa, Paraskevi] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Univ Management Sch, Conduit Rd, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England","University of Sheffield","Katsiampa, P (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Univ Management Sch, Conduit Rd, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England.","p.katsiampa@sheffield.ac.uk","","","","","","","73","53","53","2","25","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0275-5319","1878-3384","","RES INT BUS FINANC","Res.

Unlike other financial networks, such as stock and currency trading, blockchain based cryptocurrencies have the entire transaction graph accessible to the public (i.e., all transactions can be downloaded and analyzed). A natural question is then to ask whether dynamics of the transaction graph impacts price of the underlying cryptocurrency. We show that standard graph features such as degree distribution of the transaction graph may not be sufficient to capture network dynamics and its potential impact on fluctuations of Bitcoin price. In contrast, topological features computed from the blockchain graph using the tools of persistent homology, are found to exhibit higher utility for predicting Bitcoin price dynamics.","[Abay, Nazmiye Ceren; Akcora, Cuneyt Gurcan; Kantarcioglu, Murat; Thuraisingham, Bhavani] Univ Texas Dallas, Comp Sci, Richardson, TX 75083 USA; [Gel, Yulia R.; Islambekov, Umar D.; Tian, Yahui] Univ Texas Dallas, Stat, Richardson, TX 75083 USA","University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas","Abay, NC (corresponding author), Univ Texas Dallas, Comp Sci, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.","ncabay@utdallas.edu; cuneyt.akcora@utdallas.edu; ygl@utdallas.edu; umard@utdallas.edu; muratk@utdallas.edu; yahui.tian@outlook.com; bhavani.thuraisingham@utdallas.edu","Khan, Latifur/AAE-8134-2021","","NIH [1R01HG006844]; NSF [CNS-1111529, CICI-1547324, IIS-1633331, DMS-1736368]; ARO [W911NF-17-1-0356]","NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ARO","This research was supported in part by NIH 1R01HG006844, NSF CNS-1111529, CICI-1547324, IIS-1633331, DMS-1736368 & ARO W911NF-17-1-0356.","","18","5","5","1","6","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1550-4786","","978-1-7281-4603-4","IEEE DATA MINING","","","2019","","","","","","","952","957","","10.1109/ICDM.2019.00105","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2019.00105","","","6","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP5JR","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000555729900097","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Particularly focusing on Bitcoin, understood as a benchmark for the entire sector, the authors seek to answer the following questions: Should Bitcoin be considered a currency, an investment vehicle, or a speculative asset? On which factors does Bitcoin volatility depend? Do Central Banks effectively have no power to influence/stabilize Bitcoin volatility? Following the empirical strategy proposed by Baek and Elbeck, the article shows that Bitcoin returns merely depend on financial conventions and that the cryptocurrency is acting as a highly speculative asset. Sociotechnical innovations introduced by Bitcoin, the authors argue, have concretely opened the possibility of deeply rethinking money. However, several factors are currently negatively affecting the possibility of the cryptocurrency to function as an effective means of payment. Whether this experience can pave the way for the birth of new and more democratic monetary instruments, as the article discusses, is an issue that calls into question a whole combination of political, technical and social elements.","[Fama, Marco; Lucarelli, Stefano] Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Econ & Quantitat Methods, Bergamo, Italy; [Fumagalli, Andrea] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Pavia, Italy","University of Bergamo; University of Pavia","Fama, M (corresponding author), Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Econ & Quantitat Methods, Bergamo, Italy.","","Lucarelli, Stefano/B-5253-2016","Lucarelli, Stefano/0000-0003-1971-3265","","","","","42","13","13","4","16","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0891-1916","1558-0970","","INT J POLIT ECON","Int.

However, Bitcoin's immutability is not without its fair share of demerits. Interpol exposed the existence of harmful and potentially illegal documents, images and links in the Bitcoin blockchain, and since then there have been several qualitative and quantitative analysis on the types of data currently residing in the Bitcoin blockchain. Although there is a lot of attention on blockchains, surprisingly the previous solutions proposed for data redaction in the permissionless setting are far from feasible, and require additional trust assumptions. Hence, the problem of harmful data still poses a huge challenge for law enforcement agencies like Interpol (Tziakouris, IEEE S&P'18). We propose the first efficient redactable blockchain for the permissionless setting that is easily integrable into Bitcoin, and that does not rely on heavy cryptographic tools or trust assumptions. Our protocol uses a consensus-based voting and is parameterised by a policy that dictates the requirements and constraints for the redactions; if a redaction gathers enough votes the operation is performed on the chain. As an extra feature, our protocol offers public verifiability and accountability for the redacted chain. Moreover, we provide formal security definitions and proofs showing that our protocol is secure against redactions that were not agreed by consensus. Additionally, we show the viability of our approach with a proof-of-concept implementation that shows only a tiny overhead in the chain validation of our protocol when compared to an immutable one.","[Deuber, Dominic; Magri, Bernardo; Thyagarajan, Sri Aravinda Krishnan] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany; [Magri, Bernardo] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark","University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Aarhus University","Deuber, D (corresponding author), Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.","deuber@cs.fau.de; magri@cs.au.dk; thyagarajan@cs.fau.de","Thyagarajan, Sri AravindaKrishnan/GLT-6570-2022","Thyagarajan, Sri AravindaKrishnan/0000-0003-0114-7672","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [16KIS0763]; German research foundation (DFG) through the collaborative research center 1223; state of Bavaria at the Nuremberg Campus of Technology (NCT)","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German research foundation (DFG) through the collaborative research center 1223(German Research Foundation (DFG)); state of Bavaria at the Nuremberg Campus of Technology (NCT)","This work is a result of the collaborative research project PROMISE (16KIS0763) by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).

In this research, we use bitcoin, Ether, and XRP, the three cryptocurrencies with the highest market values as of this writing, as well as Libra, which is forthcoming and topical, as examples to analyze their features. Specifically, we argue that these cryptocurrencies are fundamentally different due to differences in the following factors: the identity management of their ledger writers, their consensus algorithms, and their coin supply. We discuss how these factors determine cryptocurrency performance, including security, privacy, and financial influence.

Namely, we build on features of Bitcoin's scripting language, which allows swapping coins between two compatible blockchains, and also on off-chain transactions.","[Augot, Daniel; George, William] Inria, Rocquencourt, France; [Augot, Daniel; George, William] Ecole Polytech, Lab LIX, Paris, France; [Augot, Daniel; George, William] CNRS, UMR 7161, Paris, France; [Augot, Daniel; George, William] Univ Paris Saclay, Paris, France; [Chabanne, Herve] Idemia, Courbevoie, France; [Chabanne, Herve] Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France","Inria; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; Institut Polytechnique de Paris","Augot, D (corresponding author), Inria, Rocquencourt, France.;Augot, D (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech, Lab LIX, Paris, France.;Augot, D (corresponding author), CNRS, UMR 7161, Paris, France.;Augot, D (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, Paris, France.","","","George, William/0000-0003-0748-1276; Chabanne, Herve/0000-0002-5916-3387","","","","","16","2","2","0","0","SCITEPRESS","SETUBAL","AV D MANUELL, 27A 2 ESQ, SETUBAL, 2910-595, PORTUGAL","","","978-989-758-359-9","","","","2019","","","","","","","511","518","","10.5220/0007443905110518","http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0007443905110518","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP9PQ","","hybrid","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000570402400055","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Design/methodology/approach A literature review, looking at current academic research and discourse on the topic cryptocurrency regulation, is conducted to highlight current thinking and perceived difficulties in implanting a global regulatory framework. In addition, the research explores how governments have addressed the risks posed by cryptocurrencies and how regulation has been implemented. The research focuses on the regulatory approaches of Australia, Europe and the Americas to determine whether they could feasibly address the risks posed by cryptocurrencies and be implemented on a global scale. Findings To date, few sustained efforts have been made to regulate Bitcoin or other cybercurrencies. Where regulation has been introduced, it has often proven too costly to implement, thereby, stifling Bitcoin industry growth, or too ad hoc to function effectively. These regulatory pitfalls are substantiated by the continuing difficulty faced by law enforcement agencies, in identifying individual Bitcoin users and separating those that are using them for nefarious purposes from those that are using them for legitimate ones. These challenges appear to grow exponentially when it comes to prosecuting criminals for Bitcoin-related offences, due to the enormous lack of agreement within the justice system of most countries as to the appropriate legal definition for Bitcoin. This research highlights three characteristics that will be vital to the success of any global regulatory framework. These are consistency, clarity and cost-effective implementation. A regulatory framework for Bitcoin that lacks any one of these elements will fail to meet the requirements of every stakeholder in the regulatory process. A framework that is too costly to implement will stifle fintech innovation, subsequently depriving national economies of the multitude of potential benefits promised by fostering fintech entrepreneurship. Equally, a framework that is inconsistent will hamper the global cooperation necessary to combat Bitcoin-related crime. Originality/value This research evaluates research, discourse and regulatory responses from academic and governmental sources and discusses how a global response to cryptocurrency regulation will help address the growing problem of attribution when it comes to ransomware attacks, which has experienced a considerable spike in recent months.","[Irwin, Angela S.

Many coin mixing protocols guarantee the anonymity and unlinkability of the payer and payee of a transaction. However, due to the publicity of blockchain, the confidentiality of transaction amounts has not been provided. Everyone has the chance to get the amount of a transaction, which poses a challenge to the privacy of users. To overcome the problem, we propose an improved mixing protocol based on TumbleBit, which is named TumbleBit++. TumbleBit++ combines confidential transactions with centralized untrusted anonymous payment hub, and achieves the protection of transaction amounts without undermining the anonymity of TumbleBit. TumbleBit++ allows multiple payers to trade in different transaction amounts, and Tumbler, as an untrusted third party, does not know the exact amount of each transaction and the flow of funds between the payer and payee of one transaction.","[Liu, Yi; Liu, Zhen; Long, Yu; Liu, Zhiqiang; Gu, Dawu; Huan, Fei; Jia, Yanxue] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yi] Shanghai Viewsource Informat Sci & Technol Co Ltd, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Shanghai Jiao Tong University","Liu, Z; Long, Y; Liu, ZQ; Gu, DW; Huan, F (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.","1780790324@sjtu.edu.cn; liuzhen@sjtu.edu.cn; longyu@sjtu.edu.cn; ilu_zq@sjtu.edu.cn; dwgu@sjtu.edu.cn; huanfei@sjtu.edu.cn; jiayanxue@sjtu.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61672347, 61572318, 61672339, 61872142]; National Cryptography Development Fund [MMJJ20170111]; Minhang Technology Innovation Program for SMEs, a finance business platform based on blockchain technology [2018MH110]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Cryptography Development Fund; Minhang Technology Innovation Program for SMEs, a finance business platform based on blockchain technology","The authors are supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61672347, 61572318, 61672339, 61872142), the National Cryptography Development Fund (No. MMJJ20170111) and Minhang Technology Innovation Program for SMEs, a finance business platform based on blockchain technology (2018MH110).","","14","0","0","1","2","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-31919-9; 978-3-030-31918-2","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2019","11821","","","","","","339","346","","10.1007/978-3-030-31919-9_21","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-31919-9_21","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP8UX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000568100600021","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, bitcoin blockchain is only one instantiation of blockchain technology and there exist a few qualitative analyses addressing instantiations of blockchain technology. The aim of this study was two-fold: 1) to understand the difference between bitcoin and blockchain; 2) to delineate the need (and role) of governance in blockchain technology. First, fundamental relationships (and differences) between bitcoin and blockchain are presented. Second, drawing on societal blockchain technology concerns, a key element (i.e., governance) and its role in shaping blockchain technology is suggested.

The focus is on three lines of research: price formation, detection of market inefficiency, and diversified portfolio construction. Topics such as market micro-structure and the interplay between different cryptocurrencies are only touched on briefly. We observe that many empirical studies find that Bitcoin markets are inefficient, with huge price fluctuations and long-range memory, and that these markets are heavily influenced by news and sector-specific events, or by infrastructure conditions such as volume trading and market liquidity. Nevertheless, astonishing price appreciations and modest correlation values versus other asset classes have contributed significantly to motivate applications of Bitcoin to investment and diversification. Future research may address practical implementations of such solutions and investigate the long-term sustainability and viability of these investment strategies.","[Flori, Andrea] Politeen Milano, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Via Lambruschini 4-B, I-20156 Milan, MI, Italy","","Flori, A (corresponding author), Politeen Milano, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Via Lambruschini 4-B, I-20156 Milan, MI, Italy.","andrea.flori@polimi.it","","Flori, Andrea/0000-0002-9861-3598","","","","","177","8","8","13","75","WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD","SINGAPORE","5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE","0219-0249","1793-6322","","INT J THEOR APPL FIN","Int.

Our C2P2 algorithm is the first algorithm to consider the fact that the price of a cryptocurrency c might depend not only on historical prices, sentiments, global stock indices, but also on the prices and predicted prices of other cryptocurrencies. C2P2 therefore does not predict cryptocurrency prices one coin at a time - rather it uses similarity metrics in conjunction with collective classification to compare multiple cryptocurrency features to jointly predict the cryptocurrency prices for all 21 coins considered. We show that our C2P2 algorithm beats out a recent competing 2017 paper by margins varying from 5.1-83% and another Bitcoin-specific prediction paper from 2018 by 16%. In both cases, C2P2 is the winner on all cryptocurrencies considered. Moreover, we experimentally show that the use of similarity metrics within our C2P2 algorithm leads to a direct improvement for 20 out of 21 cryptocurrencies ranging from 0.4% to 17.8%.

Researchers found, however, some vulnerabilities in PoW such as selfish mining, block withholding attack, and so on. Especially, after Rosenfeld suggested block withholding attack and Eyal made this attack practical, many variants and countermeasures have been proposed. However, most of countermeasures cause many changes in the mining algorithm itself, which makes it impractical. In this paper, we propose new countermeasure to prevent block withholding attack effectively.

Due to delays in the Bitcoin network, the Bitcoin blockchain has the potential for forming forks. In this paper, we consider a mining strategy in which the player who created the fork can attract other miners by posting rewards and the third party (other miners) has the ability to choose the fork based on their interests. We provide a model to formalize the considered case and analyze its feasibility. Based on certain game theoretical models, the best policies for two players, termed the creator of the fork and the third party, are presented. Finally, some cases of the considered model are simulated, and the average revenue of each player is compared with the theoretical revenue to verify the correctness of our strategy. When the delay varies from 0 to 400 milliseconds, adopting our strategy can acquire 23% more revenue than adopting the default strategy. The result shows that the default strategy of a miner is not always a good choice.","[Cheng, Sui; Lin, Sian-Jheng] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, CAS Key Lab Electromagnet Space Informat, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Lin, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, CAS Key Lab Electromagnet Space Informat, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China.","sjlin@ustc.edu.cn","","Lin, Sian Jheng/0000-0002-6309-2876","Hundred Talents Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province [BJ2100330001]","Hundred Talents Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province)","This work was supported in part by the Hundred Talents Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province under Grant BJ2100330001.","","27","2","2","0","5","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2019","7","","","","","","173935","173943","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2956168","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2956168","","","9","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","KF6TW","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000509374200209","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We make analogous comparisons to Standard and Poor's 500 (S and P 500), a benchmark traditional stock index and a protagonist of several studies in finance. Popular labels given to market phases are bull, bear, correction, and rally. In the first part, we fit HMMs and HSMMs and look at the evolution of hidden state parameters and state persistence parameters over time to ensure that states are correctly classified in terms of market phase labels. We conclude that our modelling approaches yield positive results in both BTC/USD and the S and P 500, and both are best modelled via four-state HSMMs. However, the two assets show different regime volatility and persistence patterns-BTC/USD has volatile bull and bear states and generally weak state persistence, while the S and P 500 shows lower volatility on the bull states and stronger state persistence. In the second part, we put our models to the test of detecting different market phases by devising investment strategies that aim to be more profitable on unseen data in comparison to a buy-and-hold approach. In both cases, for select investment strategies, four-state HSMMs are also the most profitable and significantly outperform the buy-and-hold strategy.","[Suda, David; Spiteri, Luke] Univ Malta, Fac Sci, Msida 2080, Malta","University of Malta","Suda, D (corresponding author), Univ Malta, Fac Sci, Msida 2080, Malta.","david.suda@um.edu.mt; luke.spiteri.13@um.edu.mt","","Spiteri, Luke/0000-0002-7290-2025","Endeavour Scholarship Scheme (Malta); European Union-European Social Fund (ESF)-Operational Programme II-Cohesion Policy 2014-2020, Investing in human capital to create more opportunities and promote the well-being of society","Endeavour Scholarship Scheme (Malta); European Union-European Social Fund (ESF)-Operational Programme II-Cohesion Policy 2014-2020, Investing in human capital to create more opportunities and promote the well-being of society","The research work disclosed in this publication is partially funded by the Endeavour Scholarship Scheme (Malta).

Bitcoin intends to achieve certainty of settlement of its cryptocurrency in a trustless environment, without the need for intermediaries and without recourse to any legal provision. We extend earlier work on functional modeling of the theoretical settlement problem to include blockchains, and we provide a functional interpretation of settlement finality by introducing the notion of degree of settlement finality. In principle, we conclude that functional settlement finality in Bitcoin is preferred to legal enforceability. However, in practice, the Bitcoin blockchain is not suitable for the trusted environment of the regulated financial industry unless well-known issues - such as high energy consumption, low settlement speed, problems with scalability and the 51% attack risk - are resolved.","[Wandhofer, Ruth] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Econ & Management TiSEM, Dept Econ, POB 90153, NL-5037 AB Tilburg, Netherlands; [Wandhofer, Ruth; Berndsen, Ron] London Stock Exchange Grp, 10 Paternoster Row, London EC4M 7LS, England; [Berndsen, Ron] LCH, POB 15913, NL-1001 NK Amsterdam, Netherlands","Tilburg University","Wandhofer, R (corresponding author), Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Econ & Management TiSEM, Dept Econ, POB 90153, NL-5037 AB Tilburg, Netherlands.;Wandhofer, R (corresponding author), London Stock Exchange Grp, 10 Paternoster Row, London EC4M 7LS, England.","ruthphd19@gmail.com; r.j.berndsen@tilburguniversity.edu","","Berndsen, Ron/0000-0002-8340-9041","","","","","42","1","1","1","10","INCISIVE MEDIA","LONDON","HAYMARKET HOUSE, 28-29 HAYMARKET, LONDON, SW1Y 4RX, ENGLAND","2049-5404","2049-5412","","J FINANC MARK INFRAS","J.

This process is vulnerable to different types of attacks. One of the most famous attacks in this category is Selfish Mining, introduced by Eyal and Sirer [1] in 2014. This attack is essentially a strategy that a sufficiently powerful mining pool can follow to obtain more revenue than its fair share. This is a tempting attack to deploy because every pool is trying to increase its revenue and this is an excellent opportunity. However, in most of the works to date, the effect of only one selfish pool has been studied. This is an attempt to analyze selfish mining in a competitive environment, where there are more than one selfish miners in play. To do so, we created a Bitcoin network simulator and used it to simulate different configurations of miners to be able to address this problem. In short, our finding shows that in almost all of the configurations, with the presence of a more powerful selfish miner, selfish mining actually decreases the revenue of the weaker selfish miners and also helps the stronger selfish miner.","[Azimy, Hamid; Ghorbani, Ali] Univ New Brunswick, Fac Comp Sci, Fredericton, NB, Canada","University of New Brunswick","Azimy, H (corresponding author), Univ New Brunswick, Fac Comp Sci, Fredericton, NB, Canada.","hazimy@unb.ca; ghorbani@unb.ca","","","","","","","12","5","5","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1712-364X","","978-1-7281-3265-5","ANN CONF PRIV SECUR","","","2019","","","","","","","20","27","","","","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP7DZ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000561703600003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Bitcoin, with its estimated 25 million global users and ten thousand globally distributed nodes, is by far the most widely used, best understood and battle-tested cryptocurrency in the world to reach this financially excluded demographic. Our goal in this paper is to demonstrate a technical solution that utilizes Bitcoin by making it (a) instantly transferable in a user-friendly way, (b) with minimal (preferably zero) transaction fees and (c) without sacrificing users' security (i.e. by not controlling their private keys). In our design, instant transactions are enabled by using 2-of-2 multisignature wallet addresses (split between the user and the custodial) and transaction fees are minimized by aggregating unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). On top of these two pure Bitcoin-based improvements, a fast and low-cost Bitcoin sending mechanism is proposed by creating a Bitcoin anchor on Stellar platform, effectively using Stellar as a Layer 2 solution. Lastly, mapping Bitcoin addresses to user-friendly identifiers (such as email addresses) has been evaluated to increase adoption. By combining these new techniques, we aim to overcome the limitations of Bitcoin and related solutions like off-chain (Lightning Networks) or federated side-chain (Blockstream Liquid) systems.","[Ozyilmaz, Kazim Rifat] Bogazici Univ, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey; [Kongel, Nazmi Berhan; Nalbant, Ali Erhat; Ozcan, Ahmet] Arf Labs OU, EE-11412 Tallinn, Estonia","Bogazici University","Ozyilmaz, KR (corresponding author), Bogazici Univ, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey.","kazim@monolytic.com; berhan@arf.one; alierhat@arf.one; ahmet@arf.one","Özyılmaz, Kazım Rıfat/AAG-9469-2019","Ozyilmaz, Kazim Rifat/0000-0002-7650-9116","","","","","33","0","0","2","4","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-31500-9; 978-3-030-31499-6","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2019","11737","","","","","","321","335","","10.1007/978-3-030-31500-9_21","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-31500-9_21","","","15","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BP5UZ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000558296200021","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, its applications are far beyond the financial sector. The transaction verification process for cryptocurrencies is much slower than traditional digital transaction systems. One approach to increase transaction speed and scalability is to identify a solution that offers faster Proof of Work. In this paper, we propose a method for accelerating the process of Proof of Work based on parallel mining rather than solo mining. The goal is to ensure that no more than two or more miners put the same effort into solving a specific block. The proposed method includes a process for selection of a manager, distribution of work and a reward system. This method has been implemented in a test environment that contains all the characteristics needed to perform Proof of Work for Bitcoin and has been tested, using a variety of case scenarios, by varying the difficulty level and number of validators. Preliminary results show improvement in the scalability of Proof of Work up to 34% compared to the current system.","[Hazari, Shihab Shahriar; Mahmoud, Qusay H.] Univ Ontario Inst Technol, Dept Elect Comp & Software Engn, Oshawa, ON L1G 0C5, Canada","Ontario Tech University","Hazari, SS (corresponding author), Univ Ontario Inst Technol, Dept Elect Comp & Software Engn, Oshawa, ON L1G 0C5, Canada.","shihab.hazari@uoit.ca; qusay.mahmoud@uoit.ca","","","","","","","19","30","30","1","7","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-0554-3","","","","2019","","","","","","","916","921","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BM8NK","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000469462800149","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Nevertheless, achieving privacy in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies remains challenging since blockchain is by default a public ledger. For instance, Bitcoin provides builtin pseudonymity rather than true anonymity, which can be compromised by analyzing the transactions. Several solutions have been proposed to enhance the transaction privacy of Bitcoin. Unfortunately, full anonymity is not always desirable, because malicious users are able to conduct illegal transactions, such as money laundering and drug trading, under the cover of anonymity in cryptocurrencies. As a result, regulation in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies is very essential. In this article, we analyze the privacy issues in Bitcoin and investigate some existing privacy-enhancing techniques in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies as well as some privacy-focused altcoins. In addition, we review and compare some works dealing with regulation of cryptocurrencies. Finally, we propose two possible solutions from a top view to balance privacy and regulation of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. One solution is based on decentralized group signature, in which a group manager is responsible for building a group and tracing the real payer of the group in a transaction. The other solution is based on verifiable encryption, in which a tracing manager is not actively involved in normal transactions but can trace suspicious transactions via an encrypted tag.","[Li, Yannan] Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Susilo, Willy; Yang, Guomin] Univ Wollongong, Sch Comp Informat Technol, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Susilo, Willy] Univ Wollongong, Inst Cybersecur & Cryptol iC2, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Yu, Yong] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Du, Xiaojiang] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Liu, Dongxi] CSIRO, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Guizani, Nadra] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","University of Wollongong; University of Wollongong; University of Wollongong; Shaanxi Normal University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus","Li, YN (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.","","Susilo, Willy/A-3724-2008","Susilo, Willy/0000-0002-1562-5105; Li, Yannan/0000-0002-4407-9027; Yang, Guomin/0000-0002-4949-7738","Data61, CSIRO; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0802000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61872229]; NSFC Research Fund for International Young Scientists [61750110528]; National Cryptography Development Fund [MMJJ20170216]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [GK201702004]","Data61, CSIRO; National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NSFC Research Fund for International Young Scientists; National Cryptography Development Fund; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This work is supported by Data61, CSIRO.

It is shown that the multiscaling characteristics of the exchange rate fluctuations related to the cryptocurrency market approach those of the Forex. This, in particular, applies to the BTC/ETH exchange rate, whose Hurst exponent by the end of 2018 started approaching the value of 0.5, which is characteristic of the mature world markets. Furthermore, the BTC/ETH direct exchange rate has already developed multifractality, which manifests itself via broad singularity spectra. A particularly significant result is that the measures applied for detecting cross-correlations between the dynamics of the BTC/ETH and EUR/USD exchange rates do not show any noticeable relationships.

Due to the uncertainty as to the possible future trajectories of the evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem, governments have taken a relatively hands-off approach to regulating such currencies. This approach may be justified within the theoretical information-economics framework of this paper, which draws parallels between the information economics of money and quasi-money creation within the current central banking, commercial banking, and shadow banking systems with that of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In particular, drawing lessons from the literature on the role of information in creating safe assets', in this paper the authors find that by building on symmetric (common) knowledge as to the inner workings of the Bitcoin Blockchain-though in a different way-bitcoin possesses a degree of endogenous information insensitivity typical of safe assets. This endogenous information insensitivity could support bitcoin's promise of maturing into a viable store of value and a niche medium of exchange. This finding should not be overlooked in the policy discussions for potential future regulatory interventions in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.","[Nabilou, Hossein] Univ Luxembourg, Banking & Financial Law, Fac Law Econ & Finance, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Nabilou, Hossein] Univ Penn, Law Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Prum, Andre] Univ Luxembourg, Banking Financial & Business Law Univ, Fac Law Econ & Finance, European Banking Inst, Luxembourg, Luxembourg","University of Luxembourg; University of Pennsylvania; University of Luxembourg","Nabilou, H (corresponding author), Univ Luxembourg, Banking & Financial Law, Fac Law Econ & Finance, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.;Nabilou, H (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Law Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.","hossein.nabilou@uni.lu; andre.prum@uni.lu","PRUM, Andre/K-6532-2012","PRUM, Andre/0000-0003-0347-2153; Nabilou, Hossein/0000-0001-8020-473X","","","","","138","4","4","2","14","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","2053-4833","2053-4841","","J FINANC REGUL","J.

If blockchain ever succeeds to be adopted on a large scale, Bitcoin, or any other permissionless blockchain-based cryptocurrency for that matter, is a direct threat to one of the key tenets of sovereignty: the monopoly over money. Without this traditional monopoly, states will not be able to exist as they have so far. Building on this premise, the article argues that blockchain-based money is currently posing a serious challenge to state sovereignty and could therefore reshape public law. This article also contends that Bitcoin in particular might collapse for technical reasons. However, if Bitcoin proves to be resilient enough to resist ongoing legal challenges, then the very basic norm of our legal systems will arguably change.","[de Caria, Riccardo] Univ Torino, Comparat Publ Law, Turin, Italy","University of Turin","de Caria, R (corresponding author), Univ Torino, Comparat Publ Law, Turin, Italy.","riccardo.decaria@gmail.com","de Caria, Riccardo/GWQ-3535-2022","de Caria, Riccardo/0000-0002-6460-7616","","","","","52","2","2","0","4","BRILL","LEIDEN","PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS","2213-4506","2213-4514","","EUR J COMP LAW GOV","Eur.

It combines several privacy-enhancing techniques initially envisioned for Bitcoin, such as Confidential Transactions (Maxwell, 2015), non-interactive merging of transactions (Saxena, Misra, Dhar, 2014), and cut-through of transaction inputs and outputs (Maxwell, 2013). As a remarkable consequence, coins can be deleted once they have been spent while maintaining public verifiability of the ledger, which is not possible in Bitcoin. This results in tremendous space savings for the ledger and efficiency gains for new users, who must verify their view of the system. In this paper, we provide a provable-security analysis for Mimblewimble. We give a precise syntax and formal security definitions for an abstraction of Mimblewimble that we call an aggregate cash system. We then formally prove the security of Mimblewimble in this definitional framework.

Each transaction of cryptocurrency requires a certain amount of computation and attracts transaction fees. Often, in practice, many transactions are small; therefore, they add computation and transmission overheads to the system. In this paper, we introduce a cost-saving approach, which significantly reduces transaction time and storage for small amount of payment, i.e. micropayment. In our approach, with the notion of transaction commitment', the computation of each transaction is much more efficient. Therefore, our approach has advantages in comparison of other cryptocurrency systems such as the bitcoin system. Our approach can be applied to other existing cryptocurrency systems.","[Rezaeibagha, Fatemeh] Univ Wollongong, SMART Infrastruct, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Rezaeibagha, Fatemeh] Univ Wollongong, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Mu, Yi] Fujian Normal Univ, Fujian Prov Key Lab Network Secur & Cryptol, Coll Math & Informat, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China","University of Wollongong; University of Wollongong; Fujian Normal University","Mu, Y (corresponding author), Fujian Normal Univ, Fujian Prov Key Lab Network Secur & Cryptol, Coll Math & Informat, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China.","ymu.ieee@gmail.com","Mu, Yi/AAC-3871-2019; Rezaeibagha, Fatemeh/AAG-2812-2021","Rezaeibagha, Fatemeh/0000-0002-1368-016X; Mu, Yi/0000-0002-1637-845X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61872087, 61822202, 61872089]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61872087, 61822202 and 61872089).","","23","8","8","1","18","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0010-4620","1460-2067","","COMPUT J","Comput.

Digital coins have solved this very same problem through cryptocurrencies (for instance, Bitcoin) and have opened the door to apply the same techniques to other similar scenarios where ownership of digital assets needs to be preserved. In this paper, we propose BArt, a transparent and distributed mechanism for artists to commercialize their digital artwork, keeping control of the copies, monetizing its usage, and maintaining ownership. BArt allows artists to publicly register their work in the Bitcoin blockchain and sell usage rights in exchange for bitcoins. Buyers are allowed to exert the acquired rights.

Expansion of Bitcoin, as well as other digital currencies, has been due to lower transaction costs, high security protocols and lack of inflation with respect to fiat money and no need of a clearing entity or a central bank. Although, environmental issues related to the use of this currency and, in particular, in the energy consumes, have been raised by the scientific community, but no signals of limiting factors have been detected until now. The hidden in the wings blockchain technology has been recognized the driver of innovation in various fields, contributing to create a more sustainable world. The purpose of this paper is to describe both the recent trends in the applications of the blockchain technology in the cryptocurrencies market and the new projects considering the environmental sustainability (energy consumption, materials depletion) and social impacts. The contribute of blockchain in reducing and accelerating bureaucracy and incentivizing environmentally friendly behaviour, has been discussed. Although the environmental issues related to the energy consumed in Bitcoin mining may scare companies in adopting the new technology, there is no evidence of limiting factors or carrying capacity of the entire system. In future the development of a less energy intensive alternative for validating the blocks to stack in the distributed database, would render the blockchain the ideal candidate for the applicability of sustainability paradigms in the economic, environmental and social sectors.","[Rana, Roberto Leonardo; Tricase, Caterina] Univ Foggia, Foggia, Italy; [Giungato, Pasquale] Univ Bari, Bari, Italy; [Tarabella, Angela] Univ Pisa, Pisa, Italy","University of Foggia; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; University of Pisa","Giungato, P (corresponding author), Univ Bari, Bari, Italy.","pasquale.giungato@uniba.it","rana, roberto/I-8901-2016","rana, roberto/0000-0003-0611-2049","","","","","27","13","13","10","61","EDITURA ASE","BUCURESTI","PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA","1582-9146","2247-9104","","AMFITEATRU ECON","Amfiteatru Econ.","NOV","2019","21","","","","13","","861","870","","10.24818/EA/2019/S13/861","http://dx.doi.org/10.24818/EA/2019/S13/861","","","10","Business; Economics; Management","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Business & Economics","JI2UQ","","Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000493321400009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Given the specific characteristics of the cryptocurrencies, this paper examines the possibility of their use as a diversification instrument. Objectives: This paper examines the direction and strength of the relationship between the selected cryptocurrencies and important financial indicators on the European Union market. Since cryptocurrencies are a novelty in the financial system, the empirical literature in this area is rather scarce. Methods/Approach: In order to assess diversification properties of cryptocurrencies for European traders, a comprehensive econometric analysis was carried out. The first part of the analysis refers to the estimation of the multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model, whereas the second part focuses on wavelet transforms. Results: Bitcoin and Ripple proved as a possible diversification instrument on most of the observed European markets since corresponding coefficients of unconditional correlation are negative. Conclusions: The relationship between the value of the cryptocurrencies and selected indices is generally very weak and slightly negative, indicating that some cryptocurrencies can serve as a means of diversification. However, investors need to take into account the extreme volatility, exhibited in all existing cryptocurrencies.","[Pavkovic, Ivan] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia; [Pavkovic, Ana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ Theory, Zagreb, Croatia; [Andelinovic, Mihovil] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Finance, Zagreb, Croatia","University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb, School of Dental Medicine; University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb, School of Dental Medicine; University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb, School of Dental Medicine","Pavkovic, A (corresponding author), Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ Theory, Zagreb, Croatia.","ana.pavkovic@efzg.hr; mandelinovic@etzg.hr; ipavkovic7@hotmail.com","Pavković, Ana/AAR-3288-2020","Pavković, Ana/0000-0003-0567-7558","","","","","31","4","4","4","15","SCIENDO","WARSAW","DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O, BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND","1847-8344","1847-9375","","BUS SYST RES J","Bus.

Centralized exchanges thus remain the preferred route to execute transfers across blockchains. However, these services require trust and therefore undermine the very nature of the blockchains on which they operate. To overcome this, several decentralized exchanges have recently emerged which offer support for atomic cross-chain swaps (ACCS). ACCS enable the trustless exchange of cryptocurrencies across blockchains, and are the only known mechanism to do so. However, ACCS suffer significant limitations; they are slow, inefficient and costly, meaning that they are rarely used in practice. We present XCLAIM: the first generic framework for achieving trustless and efficient cross-chain exchanges using cryptocurrency-backed assets (CBAs). XCLAIM offers protocols for issuing, transferring, swapping and redeeming CBAs securely in a non-interactive manner on existing blockchains. We instantiate XCLAIM between Bitcoin and Ethereum and evaluate our implementation; it costs less than USD 0.50 to issue an arbitrary amount of Bitcoin-backed tokens on Ethereum. We show XCLAIM is not only faster, but also significantly cheaper than atomic cross-chain swaps. Finally, XCLAIM is compatible with the majority of existing blockchains without modification, and enables several novel cryptocurrency applications, such as cross-chain payment channels and efficient multi-party swaps.","[Zamyatin, Alexei; Harz, Dominik; Lind, Joshua; Panayiotou, Panayiotis; Gervais, Arthur; Knottenbelt, William] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Zamyatin, Alexei] SBA Res, Vienna, Austria","Imperial College London","Zamyatin, A (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, London, England.;Zamyatin, A (corresponding author), SBA Res, Vienna, Austria.","","","","","","","","76","39","40","3","12","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","1081-6011","","978-1-5386-6660-9","P IEEE S SECUR PRIV","","","2019","","","","","","","193","210","","10.1109/SP.2019.00085","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SP.2019.00085","","","18","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BO3ED","","Bronze, Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000510006100012","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We document a sharp increase in the number of initial 8-K disclosures of Blockchain, particularly by Speculative firms, coinciding with the rise of Bitcoin prices and excitement in Blockchain technology in the last quarter of 2017. Investors react positively to the Blockchain 8-Ks issued by Speculative firms in the initial seven-day event window although the reaction is mostly reversed over the 30 days following the disclosure. The reaction is stronger when Bitcoin returns are more positive. Overall, our results are consistent with a situation that troubles the SEC and the financial press: investors overreact to a firm's first 8-K disclosure of a potential foray into Blockchain technology and that overreaction is a function of the Bitcoin price bubble.","[Cheng, Stephanie F.; De Franco, Gus; Jiang, Haibo; Lin, Pengkai] Tulane Univ, AB Freeman Sch Business, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Jiang, Haibo] Univ Quebec Montreal, Sch Management, Montreal, PQ H2X 3X2, Canada","Tulane University; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal","Cheng, SF (corresponding author), Tulane Univ, AB Freeman Sch Business, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.","scheng7@tulane.edu; gdefranc@tulane.edu; hjiang9@tulane.edu; plin6@tulane.edu","","Cheng, Stephanie/0000-0001-5125-6020; Jiang, Haibo/0000-0002-5034-3437; Lin, Pengkai/0000-0002-8751-7592","A.

As it has been proven several times, this could lead to funds being stolen, either due to malicious service providers that simply disappear or due to hacks that these platforms might suffer. In this work, we propose and develop a decentralised exchange solution based on smart contracts running on the Ethereum network that is open, verifiable, and does not require trust. The platform enables two parties to trade different currencies, limited to Ethereum and Bitcoin in the current status of the system. A smart contract, deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, functions as an escrow, which holds a user's funds until a verified transaction has been made by the other party. To make the smart contract able to detect a Bitcoin transfer, we implement our solution by utilising an oracle. We define the system architecture and implement a working platform, which we test in a model scenario, successfully exchanging Bitcoin and Ether on the blockchain test networks.

Data sharing is always mandatory for value exchanges and profit promotion. Currently, certain big data markets have been created for facilitating data dissemination and coordinating data transaction, but we have to assume that such centralized management of data sharing must be trustworthy for data privacy and sharing fairness, which very likely imposes limitations such as joining admission, sharing efficiency, and extra costly commissions. To avoid these weaknesses, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based fair data exchange scheme, called FaDe. FaDe can enable de-centralized data sharing in an autonomous manner, especially guaranteeing trade fairness, sharing efficiency, data privacy, and exchanging automation.

In this paper, we present a novel machine-learning model, solving a binary classification problem, that can predict transaction fee volatility in the Bitcoin network so that users can optimize their fees expenses and the approval time for their transactions. The model's output will give a confidence score whether a new incoming transaction will be included in the next mined block. The model is trained on data from a longitudinal study of the Bitcoin blockchain, containing more than 10 million transactions. New features that we generate include information on how many bytes were already occupied by other transactions in the mempool, assuming they are ordered by fee density in each mining pool. The collected dataset allows to generate a model for transaction inclusion pattern prediction in the Bitcoin network, hence telling whether a transaction is well formed or not, according to the previous transactions analyzed.

Cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin and Monero) can be defined as trustless decentralized systems which operate without a financial intermediary, making it possible to build decentralized payment systems where users are able to send payments securely without establishing trust. Due to those characteristics, the use of blockchains has spread rapidly among traditional financial systems. Large banks and corporations are investing heavily in the technology, aiming to increase its systems efficiency and reduce the costs of international transactions. Ripple was one of the first cryptocurrencies directed to financial institutions. The application of technologies brought by cryptocurrencies spread quickly to different areas with the intent of solving a myriad of problems. This tutorial presents an introduction to the technologies utilized by cryptocurrencies. The main objective is to share knowledge about the topic and promote the development of research involving those technologies.

Results show that the cryptocurrency risk premiums co-move closely with the return on CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). As such, the strategies of cryptocurrency trading closely resemble that of high-risk gambling. In other words, traders' expectations co-move closely (significantly) with the expected future payoffs from gambling. The co-movement is more pronounced when the gambling offers gains rather than losses and the payoffs are above average. VIX index returns significantly Granger-cause CSAD of returns (with and without Bitcoin) indicates that the cryptocurrency trading constitutes a form of gambling where the motivation for gambling comes from the amount of variation (i.e. riskiness) in the gambling payoffs.

It uses a public distributed ledger called the blockchain to maintain the transaction history in the network. It employs a Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol for miners to add more blocks of transactions to the chain in order to arrive at a consensus of the state of the network. Due to the nature of the consensus mechanism used, miners are not given any sense of their progression when solving a PoW problem. The only strategy presented to them is a brute-force search where it is unknown to them how far away they or other miners are to a solution, and if the problem is worth dedicating further resources to. This results in a slow and highly energy inefficient consensus protocol. In this paper we present an alternative PoW mechanism which introduces the idea of progression when solving such puzzles. This Alt-PoW mechanism gives participants a network view of how all other miners are faring in the block finding process, so they can decide whether it is in their interest to withdraw from a block race or to continue dedicating their resources towards it. We also present a mechanism to allow for multiple interconnected chains as opposed to a single blockchain, so that block finding can be parallelized. Participants can decide which chain to dedicated their resources to, based on which has the best chance of them being successful mining on at any particular time. We show that this results in a faster and more energy efficient protocol.","[Sharkey, Sarah; Tewari, Hitesh] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland","Trinity College Dublin","Sharkey, S (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.","sasharke@tcd.ie; htewari@tcd.ie","","Tewari, Hitesh/0000-0003-1738-527X","Science Foundation Ireland [13/RC/2094]; European Regional Development Fund through the Southern & Eastern Regional Operational Programme","Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation IrelandEuropean Commission); European Regional Development Fund through the Southern & Eastern Regional Operational Programme","This work was supported, in part, by Science Foundation Ireland grant 13/RC/2094 and co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund through the Southern & Eastern Regional Operational Programme to Lero the Irish Software Research Centre (www.lero.ie).","","25","4","4","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-1264-0","","","","2019","","","","","","","11","18","","10.1109/DAPPCON.2019.00012","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DAPPCON.2019.00012","","","8","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO1XR","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000502835000002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The paper uses the May 2017 WannaCry ransomware usage of the Bitcoin ecosystem as a case study. The approach proves particularly beneficial in facilitating information sharing and an integrated analysis across intelligence domains. Design/methodology/approach This study conducted data collection and analysis of the component Bitcoin elements of the WannaCry ransomware attack. A note of both technicalities of Bitcoin operations and current models for sharing cyber intelligence was made. Our analysis builds on and further develops current definitions and strategies for sharing cyber threat intelligence. It uses the problem definition model (PDM) and generic target network model (TNM) to create an analytic framework for the WannaCry ransomware attack scenario, allowing analysts the ability to test their hypotheses and integrate and share data for collaborative investigation. Findings Using a target-centric intelligence approach to WannaCry 2.0 shows that it is possible to model the intelligence problem of collecting and analysing data related to inflows and outflows of Bitcoin-related ransomware transactions. Bitcoin transactions form graph networks and allow to build a target network model for collecting, analysing and sharing intelligence with multiple stakeholders. Although attribution and anonymity prevail under cryptocurrency usage, there is a means for developing transaction walks using this method to target nefarious cryptocurrency exchanges where criminals are inclined to cash out their proceeds of crime. Originality/value The application of a target-centric intelligence approach to the cryptocurrency components of a ransomware attack provides a framework for intelligence units to break down the problem in the financial domain and model the network behaviour of illicit Bitcoin transactions relating to ransomware.","[Turner, Adam B.; McCombie, Stephen; Uhlmann, Allon J.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Secur Studies & Criminol, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Macquarie University","Turner, AB (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Secur Studies & Criminol, Sydney, NSW, Australia.","adam.turner07@gmail.com","Turner, Adam/AAP-5610-2020","Turner, Adam/0000-0002-3261-0634; Uhlmann, Allon J./0000-0003-1167-0125; McCombie, Stephen/0000-0002-6511-9382","","","","","53","5","5","2","16","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1758-7808","1368-5201","","J MONEY LAUND CONTRO","J.

Its mainstreaming application, since 2009, consists in virtual cryptocurrencies, mainly exemplified by Bitcoin (BTC), which has been officially admitted as a form of currency, initially by the USA jurisprudence. In October 2015 the Court of Justice of the European Union, interpreting Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax, did not consider bitcoin as a material good and judged that the exchange of traditional currencies (such as krona, euro.) against bitcoins is exempted from value added tax. If virtual cryptocurrencies have been recognized as means of payment, being similar to the rest currencies, many investors have preferred them as an alternative means of investment. Blockchain, having got rid of traditional figures of trade, such as banks, is comparable with another application of Internet, sharing economy, in the field of tourism. This application has recently overridden traditional figures, such as the hotelier, through digital platforms, like Airbnb.","[Maniatis, Antonios] Univ Nicosia UNIC, Sch Law, Nicosia, Cyprus","","Maniatis, A (corresponding author), Univ Nicosia UNIC, Sch Law, Nicosia, Cyprus.","","","","","","","","7","0","0","1","6","EUROMED PRESS","MARSEILLE CEDEX 9","RUE ANTOINE BOURDELLE, DOMAINE DE LUMINY BP 921, MARSEILLE CEDEX 9, 13 288, FRANCE","2547-8516","","978-9963-711-81-9","EUROMED ACAD BUS CON","","","2019","","","","","","","679","684","","","","","","6","Business; Management","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics","BP3LD","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000548057800052","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, the herding phenomenon cannot be solely attributed to Bitcoin, since the rest of the market is not herding with the main cryptocurrency.","[Vidal-Tomas, David] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Ibanez, Ana M.; Farinos, Jose E.] Univ Valencia, Dept Corp Finance, Ave Los Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain","Universitat Jaume I; University of Valencia","Ibanez, AM (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Dept Corp Finance, Ave Los Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.","dvidal@uji.es; ana.m.ibanez@uv.es; jose.e.farinos@uv.es","Vidal-Tomas, David/ABB-5697-2020","Vidal-Tomas, David/0000-0003-4519-0592; Farinos, Jose Emilio/0000-0002-9066-231X; Ibanez, Ana M/0000-0003-0362-5535","Spanish Ministry of Education [FPU2015/01434]","Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government)","The authors would like to thank the Editor and the referees for their comments that improved the paper.

By using VAR (Vector Autoregressive Model)-SVAR (Structural Vector Autoregressive Model) Granger causality and Student's-t Copulas, we find that Ethereum is likely to be the independent coin in this market, while Bitcoin tends to be the spillover effect recipient. Our study sheds further light on investigating the contagion risks among cryptocurrencies by employing Student's-t Copulas for joint distribution. This result suggests that all coins negatively change in terms of extreme value. The investors are advised to pay more attention to bad news' and moving patterns in order to make timely decisions on three types (buy, hold, and sell).","[Toan Luu Duc Huynh] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Sch Banking, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam; [Toan Luu Duc Huynh] WHU Otto Beishe Sch Management, Burgpl 2, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany","WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management","Huynh, TLD (corresponding author), Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Sch Banking, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam.;Huynh, TLD (corresponding author), WHU Otto Beishe Sch Management, Burgpl 2, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany.","toanhld@ueh.edu.vn","Huynh, Toan Luu Duc/V-6735-2019","Huynh, Toan Luu Duc/0000-0002-3686-0884; Huynh, Toan Luu Duc/0000-0002-1486-127X","School of Banking, University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam); Chair of Behavioral Finance, WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management (Germany)","School of Banking, University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam); Chair of Behavioral Finance, WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management (Germany)","This research was funded by School of Banking, University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) and Chair of Behavioral Finance, WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management (Germany).","","97","47","47","3","17","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

In spite of the wide attention that cyrpto-currencies (such as Bitcoin) have attracted, Blockchain technology is more likely to make an impact beyond ongoing speculations on cyrpto-currencies. Decentralized identity management, transparent supply-chain systems, and IoT governance and security are only few examples of research challenges for which this technology may hold substantial potential. Blockchain technology has emerged at the intersection of two well established research areas: peer-to-peer (P2P) computing and cryptography. In this tutorial, we provide a general overview of the main components behind this technology, we present the difference between the types of Blockchain available today, and we make a high level discussion on its potentials and limitations as well as possible research challenges.","[Bahri, Leila; Girdzijauskas, Sarunas] Royal Inst Technol KTH, Stockholm, Sweden","Royal Institute of Technology","Bahri, L (corresponding author), Royal Inst Technol KTH, Stockholm, Sweden.","lbahri@kth.se; sarunasg@kth.se","","Girdzijauskas, Sarunas/0000-0003-4516-7317","","","","","5","1","1","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-2406-3","","","","2019","","","","","","","249","250","","10.1109/FAS-W.2019.00066","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/FAS-W.2019.00066","","","2","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO5WX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000518905900052","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In particular, we study and exploit both the non-permissioned ledger of Bitcoin, and the MultiChain permissioned ledger. We describe the main architectural choices behind the two implementations, including the pre-voting and post-voting phases. Similar approaches are not as decentralised as our application, where it is possible to directly cast a vote to the block-chain, without any intermediate level. Benefits and drawbacks of each implementation are explained. The Bitcoin block-chain consists in a large number of already available nodes in the related peer-to-peer network; moreover, its reliability and resistance to attacks are also well established. With MultiChain we instead exploit a fine-grained permission system: MultiChain is a permissioned public ledger. Hence, with it we can also satisfy two more properties of end-to-end voting systems: uncoercibility and receipt-freeness and data confidentiality and neutrality. Moreover, we can avoid costs and price fluctuations related to Bitcoin.","[Bistarelli, Stefano; Mercanti, Ivan; Santancini, Paolo; Santini, Francesco] Univ Perugia, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Perugia, Italy","University of Perugia","Santini, F (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Perugia, Italy.","francesco.santini@unipg.it","Bistarelli, Stefano/C-3211-2008; Santini, Francesco/AAE-5575-2021","Bistarelli, Stefano/0000-0001-7411-9678; Santini, Francesco/0000-0002-3935-4696; Mercanti, Ivan/0000-0002-9774-1600","","","","","49","14","14","1","4","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1570-7873","1572-9184","","J GRID COMPUT","J.

Investors paid their Ethers for the DAO to operate and received the opportunity to vote on and become investors in venture projects proposed by Ethereum-based startups.

The DAO experiment failed shortly after inception as an anonymous hacker stole over $50M USD worth of Ethers out of the $168M invested. The Ethereum community voted to return (or fork) the state of the network to one prior to the hack, returning Ethers back to investors and shuttering the DAO.

Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies were recently analyzed using methods from statistical physics, but focus was exclusively on behavior of prices. Here we explore multifractal behavior of daily price changes and daily volume changes of fifty cryptocurrencies using the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA). Our results indicate that price changes are more complex than volume changes, and that large and small fluctuations dominate multifractal behavior of price and volume changes, respectively. We also find there is an absence of correlations in price changes, while volume changes present anti-persistent long-term correlations. Shuffling the series reveals that multifractality of both price and volume changes arises from a broad probability density function. The multifractal behavior of the cryptocurrency market is surprisingly similar to that of stock markets, but differs from that of regular exchange rates.

This technology is raising a lot of interest both in academia and industry, but the lack of tools to evaluate design and implementation decisions may hamper fast progress. To address this issue, this paper presents a discrete-event simulator that is flexible enough to evaluate different blockchain implementations. These blockchains can be rapidly modeled and simulated by extending existing models. Running Bitcoin and Ethereum simulations allowed us to change conditions and answer different questions about their performance. For example, we concluded that doubling the number of transactions per block has a low impact on the block propagation delay (10ms) and that encrypting communication has a high impact in that delay (more than 25%).","[Faria, Carlos; Correia, Miguel] Univ Lisbon, Blockbird Ventures, Inst Super Tecn, INESC ID, Lisbon, Portugal","INESC-ID; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico","Faria, C (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Blockbird Ventures, Inst Super Tecn, INESC ID, Lisbon, Portugal.","carlosfigueira@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; miguel.p.correia@tecnico.ulisboa.pt","Correia, Miguel/L-6890-2015","Correia, Miguel/0000-0001-7873-5531","European Commission [SEP-210506957]; national funds through Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) (INESC-ID) [UID/CEC/50021/2019]","European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); national funds through Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) (INESC-ID)","We warmly thank Alysson Bessani and anonymous reviewers for feedback on previous versions of this work.

Various static and dynamic connectedness measures developed by Diebold and Yilmaz [28] and Barunik and Krehlik [29] are utilized. Our empirical results show that firstly the return spillovers within the four hedging assets are mainly observed in short-term horizon, however, the volatility spillovers are primarily found in long-term horizon. Secondly, USD acts as the major information transmitter in return spillovers in both time and frequency domains of short to long-term time horizons. Thirdly, crude oil dominates other assets by contributing the largest net positive volatility spillovers, especially in long-term horizon.

In the literature on blockchains, it is found that most articles focused on their engineering implementation, while little attention has been devoted to the exploration of theoretical aspects of the system; however, the existing work is limited to model the mining process only. In this paper, a queuing theory-based model is proposed for understanding the working and theoretical aspects of the blockchain. We validate our proposed model using the actual statistics of two popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, by running simulations for two months of transactions. The obtained performance measures parameters such as the Number of Transactions per block, Mining Time of Each Block, System Throughput, Memorypool count, Waiting Time in Memorypool, Number of Unconfirmed Transactions in the Whole System, Total Number of Transactions, and Number of Generated Blocks; these values are compared with actual statistics. It was found that the results gained from our proposed model are in good agreement with actual statistics. Although the simulation in this paper presents the modeling of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies only, the proposed model can be used to represent a wide range of blockchain-based systems.","[Memon, Raheel Ahmed; Li, Jian Ping] Univ Elect Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Memon, Raheel Ahmed] Sukkur IBA Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Sukkur 65200, Pakistan; [Ahmed, Junaid] Sukkur IBA Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Sukkur 65200, Pakistan","University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Sukkur IBA University; Sukkur IBA University","Memon, RA (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Memon, RA (corresponding author), Sukkur IBA Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Sukkur 65200, Pakistan.","raheelmemon@iba-suk.edu.pk; jpli2222@uestc.edu.cn; j.bhatti@iba-suk.edu.pk","Memon, Raheel/O-7548-2017; Ahmed, Junaid/E-1670-2019","Ahmed, Junaid/0000-0003-0083-8068; Li, Jian Ping/0000-0003-2192-1450; Memon, Raheel Ahmed/0000-0003-1206-3837","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61370073]; National High Technology Research and Development Program of China [2007AA01Z423]; Project of Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province; Chengdu Civil-Military Integration Project Management Co., Ltd.","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National High Technology Research and Development Program of China(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China); Project of Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province; Chengdu Civil-Military Integration Project Management Co., Ltd.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61370073), National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2007AA01Z423), Project of Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province; and Chengdu Civil-Military Integration Project Management Co., Ltd.","","53","33","35","5","41","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","2079-9292","","","ELECTRONICS-SWITZ","Electronics","FEB","2019","8","2","","","","","","","234","10.3390/electronics8020234","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics8020234","","","19","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Physics","HO2LL","","gold, Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000460746500119","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The aim of this paper is to investigate the periods in which capital outflows from the capital market to the cryptocurrency market occur and whether cryptocurrencies can serve as a safe haven in turbulent periods. The theoretical part systematically describes the properties of cryptocurrencies as alternative forms of investment. The empirical section analyzes two leading representatives of the capital and cryptocurrency markets - the S&P500 and Bitcoin exchange index - using Engle's dynamic conditional correlation model. The results show that the correlation between the two markets is time-varying, with its largest negative values picking up in late 2015, mid-2016 and early 2017, just when the volatility of the S & P500 index was the highest. This confirms that the cryptocurrency market is a safe haven in periods of high volatility in the US capital market.","[Arneric, Josip] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia; [Mateljan, Mladen] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Split, Croatia","University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb, School of Dental Medicine; University of Split","Arneric, J (corresponding author), Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.","jarneric@efzg.hr; mmatel01@live.efst.hr","Arneric, Josip/AAE-2023-2022; Arneric, Josip/AAI-6473-2021","Arneric, Josip/0000-0002-2901-2609; Arneric, Josip/0000-0002-2901-2609","","","","","24","0","0","0","8","UNIV DUBROVNIK","DUBROVNIK","BRANITELJ DUBROVNIKA 29, DUBROVNIK, 20000, CROATIA","1330-1039","1848-963X","","EKON MISAO PRAKSA","Ekon.

While academic research covers nearly all areas of the technological concepts of those currencies, legal studies focus only on a few topics. The papers that have been published so far discuss mainly economic law, tax law, and financial regulations. At the same time, governments are starting to explicitly regulate cryptocurrencies in terms of anti-money-laundering (AML) and to clarify or strengthen the legal basis for prosecuting crimes in the context of cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, criminal investigation in the context of cryptocurrencies is intensifying with the rising number of cryptocurrency-related crimes. Moreover, governments should also start to consider crime prevention in the context of cryptocurrencies. AML regulation, crime prevention, and prosecution have to take heed of the fundamental rights of the citizens affected. To date, legal research has not discussed the relationship between AML regulation (regarding cryptocurrencies), crime prevention (in conjunction with cryptocurrencies), the prosecution of crimes involving cryptocurrencies and fundamental rights. Many future regulatory concepts will collide with the fundamental right to property of the owners of cryptocurrency units and the freedom to pursue a trade or profession of owners and operators of exchange platforms, mining pools, etc. In cryptocurrencies organized as peer-to-peer systems, the freedom of association also has to be mentioned. With particular regard to prosecution, law enforcement agencies restrict the freedom of telecommunication, data privacy (including the right to informational self-determination), freedom of expression, and the freedom of information. Whenever some of these fundamental rights are impinged upon, regulation concepts and investigation or prosecution approaches must be provided for by law and must fulfill the criterion of necessity. Further interdisciplinary research is needed to develop efficient and legit prevention as well as criminal investigation concepts.","[Rueckert, Christian] FAU Erlangen Nuremberg, Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Schillerstr 1, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany","Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Erlangen Nuremberg","Rueckert, C (corresponding author), FAU Erlangen Nuremberg, Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Schillerstr 1, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.","christian.rueckert@fau.de","","","European Union [740558]","European Union(European Commission)","This work was supported by the European Union (Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement number 740558).","","79","4","4","7","27","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","2057-2085","2057-2093","","J CYBERSECURITY","J.

One of the most serious security problems is facing several attacking strategies on the bitcoin protocol, represented by selfish mining and block withholding attacks. In this paper, we propose SelfHolding as a combined attack model based on the selfish mining and block withholding strategies. We mainly focus on the SelfHolding attacker when (i) attacking one honest mining pool: (ii) attacking two honest mining pools. Based on the proposed model, we compute the expected revenue of the attacker and analyze the factors affecting it. Finally, we compare the revenues of an attacker under some other attacking strategies to those of our proposed strategy. Our experiments show that when the attacker's computing power is relatively small, SelfHolding attack strategy can obtain higher revenues than the classic selfish mining attack.

We extend previous analysis on a fundamental trade-off between the throughput and forking rate of the blockchain system. We further propose FastChain to increase the throughput of the blockchain system by reducing the block propagation time. FastChain adopts bandwidth-informed neighbor selection. Miners disconnect from bandwidth-limited neighbors and favor the nodes with higher bandwidth. We build a Blockchain Dynamics Simulator (BDSim) to evaluate the performance of FastChain.

In this paper, we model the adaptive behavior of various entities in a Bitcoin market. We employ CASTLE, a dedicated framework for the modeling of adaptability in complex adaptive systems. Contrary to existing models where realistic details are not included, we introduce the influence of price speculation and news on trader behavior and experiment with different trader behaviors under varying market conditions.

The Bitcoin blockchain is likely the first case of an increasingly generative and autonomous way of organizing, and the specific properties of blockchain infrastructures-distribution of control, openness to manipulation, and generativity of the underlying source code-make it an ideal case to study patterns of self-organizing. This paper investigates the phenomenon of self-organizing through a study of forking in the Bitcoin blockchain infrastructure between 2010 and 2016. It adds to the emerging body of research on digital infrastructures, and particularly blockchain infrastructures, by conceptualizing forking as a pattern of self-organizing in blockchain infrastructures that specifically involves the underlying infrastructure, the scale of code changes, individual objectives, and collective adoption, whether specific or general. Thus, this paper demonstrates how forking in blockchain infrastructures mediates between divergent organizing objectives and existing capabilities, on the one hand, and generates self-organizing on the other hand. In this paper, we further contextualize our findings in extant work on digital infrastructures, offer a guide for designers of blockchain infrastructures, and propose the concept of generative mirroring as a pattern through which blockchain infrastructures and organizing adaptively coevolve.","[Andersen, Jonas Valbjorn] IT Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Bogusz, Claire Ingram] Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden","IT University Copenhagen; Stockholm School of Economics","Andersen, JV (corresponding author), IT Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.","jova@itu.dk; claire.ingram@hhs.se","Ingram Bogusz, Claire/Q-5402-2016","Ingram Bogusz, Claire/0000-0001-9160-347X","","","","","113","18","18","13","61","ASSOC INFORMATION SYSTEMS","ATLANTA","GEORGIA STATE UNIV, 35 BROAD STREET, STE 916-917, ATLANTA, GA 30303 USA","1536-9323","1558-3457","","J ASSOC INF SYST","J.

Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to introduce and conceptually ground blockchain in sport and discuss the implications and value proposition of blockchain to the sport industry. After a brief overview of blockchain and the technology stack, the mechanism is conceptually rooted in the network paradigm, a framework already known to the academic sport community. This treatment argues that the decentralized, closed, and dense mesh network produced by blockchain technology is beneficial to the sport industry. Notably, the article identifies blockchain's capacity to facilitate new sources of revenue and improve data management and suggests that sport management and communication consider the value of blockchain and the technology stack as the digital footprint in the industry intensifies and becomes increasingly complex.","[Naraine, Michael L.] Deakin Univ, Fac Business & Law, Dept Management, Burwood, Vic, Australia","Deakin University","Naraine, ML (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Fac Business & Law, Dept Management, Burwood, Vic, Australia.","michael.naraine@deakin.edu.au","Naraine, Michael/AAQ-5033-2020","Naraine, Michael/0000-0002-9132-1269","","","","","77","7","7","2","40","HUMAN KINETICS PUBL INC","CHAMPAIGN","1607 N MARKET ST, PO BOX 5076, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820-2200 USA","1936-3915","1936-3907","","INT J SPORT COMMUN","Int.

The traditional client-server and cloud-based healthcare data management systems suffer from the issues of single point of failure, data privacy, centralized data stewardship, and system vulnerability. The replication mechanism, and privacy and security features of blockchain have a promising future in the healthcare domain as they can solve some of the inherent issues of the health management system. However, most of the recent research works on blockchain in the healthcare domain have primarily focused on the permission-less Bitcoin network that suffers from drawbacks such as high energy consumption, limited scalability, and low transaction throughput. Consequently, there is a need for a scalable, fault-tolerant, secure, traceable and private blockchain to suit the requirements of the healthcare domain. We propose a lightweight blockchain architecture for the healthcare data management that reduces the computational and communication overhead compared to the Bitcoin network by dividing the network participants into clusters and maintaining one copy of the ledger per cluster. Our architecture introduces the use of canal, that allows secure and confidential transactions within a group of network participants. Furthermore, we propose a solution to avoid forking which is prevalent in the Bitcoin network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture in providing security and privacy compared to the Bitcoin network by analyzing different threats and attacks. We also discuss how our proposed architecture addresses the identified threats. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed architecture generates 11 times lower network traffic compared to the Bitcoin network as the number of blocks increases. Our ledger update is 1.13 times faster. Our architecture shows a speedup of 67 in ledger update and 10 times lower network traffic when the number of nodes increases.","[Ismail, Leila; Materwala, Huned] UAE Univ, Coll Informat Technol, Al Ain 15551, U Arab Emirates; [Zeadally, Sherali] Univ Kentucky, Coll Commun & Informat, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","United Arab Emirates University; University of Kentucky","Ismail, L (corresponding author), UAE Univ, Coll Informat Technol, Al Ain 15551, U Arab Emirates.","leila@uaeu.ac.ae","Zeadally, Sherali/AAY-9504-2020; Ismail, Leila/Y-4172-2019","Ismail, Leila/0000-0003-0946-1818; Materwala, huned/0000-0002-3176-245X","Emirates Center for Energy and Environment Research of the United Arab Emirates University [31R101]","Emirates Center for Energy and Environment Research of the United Arab Emirates University","This work was supported by the Emirates Center for Energy and Environment Research of the United Arab Emirates University under Grant 31R101.","","56","65","66","4","20","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2019","7","","","","","","149935","149951","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2947613","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2947613","","","17","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","JN8SC","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000497160500077","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Most of the cryptocurrencies are created by individuals, organizations, and companies, which implies that there is still no clearly defined regulator and regulation in this area. This is precisely the basic characteristic of the cryptocurrencies and refers to the absence of central authority for the emission and management of these currencies. There are currently more than 1300 cryptocurrencies in the world, with a clear tendency for their growth. This is happening regardless of their volatility and possibility of collapse for some cryptocurrencies. These trends are present globally and are slowly starting to develop in the Western Balkan countries. In this paper, cryptocurrencies represent the central research topic. Through the critical analysis of this concept, the aim is to clarify the different interpretations of the same, along with the blockchain technology on which cryptocurrencies are based. In addition, the paper presents the main features of the cryptocurrencies, with the potential of their growth, and the challenges that accompany them. Paper also offers analysis of the potential of blockchain technology. In the end, an appropriate conclusion will be made, with recommendations for improvement in this area.","","","","","","","","","","","7","0","0","3","5","UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS & BUSINESS","RIJEKA","IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, CROATIA","","","978-953-7813-46-8","","","","2019","","","","","","","633","639","","","","","","7","Business; Communication; Economics","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics; Communication","BQ4EU","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000589270200036","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It observes the response of the networks when nodes or links are removed from potential threats. Most of the existing works focus on the enhancement of the robustness itself, but not considering the completeness of the possible removal attacks from the viewpoint of adversary. We first put forward a new ensemble learning based critical node removal attack (ECNRA) algorithm, and prove that the damage of the robustness using the proposed algorithm is worse than that using the degree attack and random node attack. In order to solve the uncertainty of the network robustness evaluation algorithm proposed before, we propose a new complex network robustness evaluation algorithm. Finally we apply our attack algorithm to a Bitcoin OTC network. The result shows that our algorithm is better than the other two algorithm.","[Li, Xinyi; Zhang, Zijian; Gai, Keke] Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jiamou] Univ Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand","Beijing Institute of Technology; University of Auckland","Zhang, ZJ (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.","2120171114@bit.edu.cn; zhangzijian@bit.edu.cn; jiamou.liu@auckland.ac.nz; gaikeke@bit.edu.cn","li, xinyi/GWZ-8941-2022; Gai, Keke/H-7138-2019","Gai, Keke/0000-0001-6784-0221","China National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFB0800301]","China National Key Research and Development Program","This work is supported by China National Key Research and Development Program under Grant No. 2016YFB0800301.","","33","3","3","0","0","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","","978-1-4503-6786-8","","","","2019","","","","","","","13","17","","10.1145/3327960.3332385","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3327960.3332385","","","5","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7HA","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000848505900002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

With that, a watchtower just needs to watch for specific cheating commitment transaction IDs on the blockchain and can extract signed justice transactions directly from these commitment transactions that appear on the blockchain. Our construction saves an order of magnitude in storage over existing watchtower designs. In addition, we let the watchtower prove to each channel that it has access to all the data required to do its job, and can therefore be paid-per-update.","[Khabbazian, Majid] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Nadahalli, Tejaswi; Wattenhofer, Roger] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland","University of Alberta; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich","Khabbazian, M (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.","mkhabbazian@ualberta.ca; tejaswin@ethz.ch; wattenhofer@ethz.ch","","","","","","","8","8","9","1","4","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-6732-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","31","40","","10.1145/3318041.3355464","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3318041.3355464","","","10","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO5QB","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000518634900003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, blockchains are subject to different scalability, security and potential privacy issues, such as transaction linkability, crypto-keys management (e.g. recovery), on-chain data privacy, or compliance with privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR). To deal with these challenges, novel privacy-preserving solutions for blockchain based on crypto-privacy techniques are emerging to empower users with mechanisms to become anonymous and take control of their personal data during their digital transactions of any kind in the ledger, following a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) model. In this sense, this paper performs a systematic review of the current state of the art on privacy-preserving research solutions and mechanisms in blockchain, as well as the main associated privacy challenges in this promising and disrupting technology. The survey covers privacy techniques in public and permissionless blockchains, e.g. Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as privacy-preserving research proposals and solutions in permissioned and private blockchains.

Earlier, cryptographic authentication techniques were used to make transactions very secure with third-party verification. However, in recent times, digital transactions have developed to allow online payments to be made directly from one party to another, without the intervention of the third party. This kind of P2P network transaction is achieved by utilizing the blockchain innovation. A blockchain uses the idea of Bitcoin. It isn't observed by the central authority, but its clients direct and approve exchanges when one individual pays another for merchandise or administrations, dispensing with the requirement for outside confirmation. All finished exchanges are freely recorded as a block and each block is added one after other to form as a blockchain. In this paper, we present the workflow of a digital online payment system using the blockchain technique. We explain the secure sign-in procedure of the blockchain strategy. We elaborate on the effects of blockchain technology on the online transaction management system in terms of security and usability.","[Laxmaiah, M.; Neha, T.] CMR Engn Coll, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Hyderabad, Telangana, India","","Laxmaiah, M (corresponding author), CMR Engn Coll, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.","laxmanmettu.cse@gmail.com; thotapalli.neha30@gmail.com","","","","","","","16","0","0","1","13","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES","1876-1100","1876-1119","978-981-13-0212-1; 978-981-13-0211-4","LECT NOTES ELECTR EN","","","2019","500","","","","","","703","712","","10.1007/978-981-13-0212-1_71","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-0212-1_71","","","10","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BM5IG","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000465012200071","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Scholars from Knapp to Desan have elaborated token theories of commodity money, wherein both precious and non-precious currencies are treated as the products of social construction. By contrast, I suggest the need to supplement such approaches with what I term a commodity theory of token money, wherein money objects made from both precious and non-precious materials are treated as inherently valuable. Exploring the semiotic convergence between gold, Bitcoin and modern paper money, I suggest that the broadly Peircean notion of rhematization in which symbol and indexical signs are (mis)taken for iconic ones is particularly suited to unpack the continuing social salience of commodity theories of money across the gold/paper divide. Moreover attention must be paid to how we define the icon itself.","[Vasantkumar, Chris] Macquarie Univ, Dept Anthropol, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia","Macquarie University","Vasantkumar, C (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Anthropol, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.","chris.vasantkumar@mq.edu.au","","Vasantkumar, Chris/0000-0003-4497-3122","","","","","86","5","5","1","4","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1753-0350","1753-0369","","J CULT ECON-UK","J.

Combining these approaches allows us to propose a model that replicates the long-range memory of absolute return and trading activity. We compare the statistical properties of the model against the empirical statistical properties of the Bitcoin exchange rates and New York stock exchange tickers.

Performance of such networks get affected by selfish nodes that do not participate in message forwarding. Thus, nodes must receive satisfactory rewards for cooperation. The available incentive schemes either rely on central trusted authorities or do not use an explicit and secure digital currency. Blockchain, a decentralized digital ledger of immutable transactions, is an attractive approach for addressing the incentive challenges in peer-to-peer networks that lack central trusted authorities. Bitcoin, the Blockchain based cryptocurrency, make it possible to devise practical credit based incentive schemes for such networks. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain based incentive scheme for DTN based post disaster communication network that uses Bitcoin to incentivize nodes for cooperation.

The model is applied to blockchain-based online payment systems which have a characteristic of immutability by preventing data manipulation. The model normalizes user evaluations based on each user's personal evaluation criteria that changes over time. In addition, the model derives reputation of, and trust between, users by applying psychological factors.

The results show, in the medium to long-run, the validity of Metcalfe's law (the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system) for the evaluation of cryptocurrencies; however, in the short-run, the validity of Metcalfe's law for Bitcoin is questionable. According to the bidirectional causality between the price and the network size, the expected price increase is a driver for more investors to join the Bitcoin network, which may lead in the end to a super-exponential price growth, possibly due to a herding behaviour of investors. The authors then used LPPL models to capture the behaviour of cryptocurrencies exchange rates during an endogenous bubble and to predict the most probable time of the regime switching. The main conclusion of this paper is that Metcalfe's law may be valid in the long-run, however in the short-run, on various data regimes, its validity is highly debatable.","[Pele, Daniel Traian; Mazurencu-Marinescu-Pele, Miruna] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania","Bucharest University of Economic Studies","Pele, DT (corresponding author), Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.","danpele@ase.ro","Pele, Daniel Traian/G-2059-2011; Pele, Miruna Mazurencu Marinescu/AAT-3808-2021","Pele, Daniel Traian/0000-0002-5891-5495; ","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through the International Research Training Group 1792 High Dimensional Nonstationary Time Series","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through the International Research Training Group 1792 High Dimensional Nonstationary Time Series","We would like to express our thanks to the anonymous referees and the Editor whose very careful and detailed comments have helped to improve this paper considerably.

Considering that digital alternative payment methods represent a key factor to the smart cities development, in this study we propose an innovative payment solution aimed at improving the remittance flows by exploiting the potential of blockchain technology. Traditional banking remittance systems are characterized by high transaction fees and long transfer times, therefore they encourage the adoption of informal channels for money transfer with consequent losses in the economic system. By focusing our interest in a specific country of Sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopia, we launch an innovative blockchain based system able to make the remittance process safer, faster and to allow secure and reliable transactions between the counterparts in data sharing. We describe its architecture, which enables a secure management of big data and the different stages of solution design. Furthermore, the system guarantees the compliance with the Ethiopian government's recommendations on the matter, in particular it allows to encourage formal data collection on remittances and to support the introduction of new technology in the payments system. In addition, its use by individuals could improve awareness and financial education in Ethiopia and it can help prevent money laundering and financing of terrorism.","[Ricci, Piergiorgio] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Enterprise Engn, Rome, Italy; [Mammanco, Valentina] UNICEF, Child Protect Dept, Rome, Italy","University of Rome Tor Vergata","Ricci, P (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Enterprise Engn, Rome, Italy.","piergiorgio.ricci@uniroma2.it; valentina.mammanco@gmail.com","","","","","","","31","1","1","0","4","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1530-1346","","978-1-7281-2999-0","IEEE SYMP COMP COMMU","","","2019","","","","","","","1165","1170","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BP9AI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000568621700195","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Those mechanisms rely on the blockchain proper, as the resolution mechanism. They allow for high transaction throughput due to the pure peer-to-peer nature of the transaction exchange that happens directly between the peers, without the involvement of the blockchain transactions. The transactions are not mediated through the blockchain but happen off-chain. The transactions in such overlay networks are not included in the blockchain, they nevertheless leave some data traces in a public ledger. We have used the Bitcoin mainnet and testnet blockchains together with the Lightning network node to explore what can be inferred from the underlying blockchain in the context of Lightning transactions, channel setup, and channel teardown. The main purpose of this study is to identify what methods, transaction signatures, and data can be used to understand the non-visible publicly off-chain transactions. We have proposed heuristics for identifying the setup and teardown transactions, quantified and analyzed the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Using the data from the Bitcoin blockchain, as well as the data from the Lightning network to link related information we have found when parsing the blockchain, we generate network graph representations showing the relationships between the Lightning network channels identified on the blockchain. This study is significant from the personal data and privacy perspectives, as well as from forensics. We have established that at least 75% of all P2WSH transactions are Lightning transactions, and some of the channels can be deduced from the blockchain analysis. The synthesized results demonstrate that our methods are viable for identifying a subset of transactions and that only partial topology of the payment channels can be obtained from the data left in the blockchain.","[Nowostawski, Mariusz; Ton, Jardar] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, NTNU, Comp Sci Dept, Teknologivegen 22, N-2815 Gjovik, Norway","Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)","Nowostawski, M (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, NTNU, Comp Sci Dept, Teknologivegen 22, N-2815 Gjovik, Norway.","mariusz.nowostawski@ntnu.no; jardar.ton@ntnu.no","","","","","","","25","6","6","2","12","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2076-3417","","APPL SCI-BASEL","Appl.

However, a systematic investigation of the relationship between online attention and market dynamics across multiple digital currencies is still lacking. Here, we quantify the interplay between the attention to digital currencies in Wikipedia and their market performance. We consider the entire edit history of currency-related pages and their views history from July 2015. First, we quantify the evolution of cryptocurrency presence in Wikipedia by analyzing the editorial activity and the network of co-edited pages. We found that a small community of tightly connected editors are responsible for most of the production of information about cryptocurrencies in Wikipedia. Then, we show that a simple trading strategy informed by Wikipedia views, performs better than baseline strategies, in terms of returns on investment, for most of the covered period, although the buy and hold strategy dominates during the periods of explosive market expansion. Our results contribute to the recent literature on the interplay between online information and investment markets, and we anticipate that it will be of interest for researchers as well as investors.","[ElBahrawy, Abeer; Baronchelli, Andrea] City Univ London, Dept Math, London, England; [Alessandretti, Laura] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Social Data Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Baronchelli, Andrea] British Lib, Alan Turing Inst, London, England; [Baronchelli, Andrea] UCL, UCL Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England","City University London; University of Copenhagen; University of London; University College London","Baronchelli, A (corresponding author), City Univ London, Dept Math, London, England.;Baronchelli, A (corresponding author), British Lib, Alan Turing Inst, London, England.;Baronchelli, A (corresponding author), UCL, UCL Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England.","andrea.baronchelli.1@city.ac.uk","","Alessandretti, Laura/0000-0001-6003-1165","Alan Turing Institute","Alan Turing Institute","We would like to thank Miriam Redi from the Wikimedia Foundation for her valuable discussion on the Wikipedia structure.

Existing studies on pools' interactive attacks usually employ the conventional game theory, where the strategies of the players are considered pure and equal, neglecting the existence of powerful strategies and the corresponding favorable game results. In this study, we take advantage of the Zero-Determinant (ZD) strategy to analyze the block withholding attack between any two pools, where the ZD adopter has the unilateral control on the expected payoffs of its opponent and itself. In this case, we are faced with the following questions: who can adopt the ZD strategy? individually or simultaneously? what can the ZD player achieve?

Is this proportional allocation rule optimal? And in what sense? And what other rules are possible? In particular, what are the desirable properties that any good allocation rule should satisfy? To answer these questions, we embark on an axiomatic theory of incentives in proof-of-work blockchains at the time scale of a single block. We consider desirable properties of allocation rules including: symmetry; budget balance (weak or strong); sybil-proofness; and various grades of collusion-proofness. We show that Bitcoin's proportional allocation rule is the unique allocation rule satisfying a certain system of properties, but this does not hold for slightly weaker sets of properties, or when the miners are not risk-neutral. We also point out that a rich class of allocation rules can be approximately implemented in a proof-of-work blockchain.","[Chen, Xi; Papadimitriou, Christos; Roughgarden, Tim] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA","Columbia University","Chen, X (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.","xc2198@columbia.edu; christos@columbia.edu; tr@cs.columbia.edu","","","Columbia-IBM Center for Blockchain and Data Transparency; NSF [IIS-1838154, CCF-1703925, CCF-1763970, CCF-1813188]; ARO [W911NF1910294]","Columbia-IBM Center for Blockchain and Data Transparency; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ARO","All three authors were supported in part by the Columbia-IBM Center for Blockchain and Data Transparency.

Nevertheless, the actual advantages in using blockchain instead of any other traditional solution (such as centralized databases) are not completely understood to date, or at least there is a strong need for a vademecum guiding designers toward the right decision about when to adopt blockchain or not, which kind of blockchain better meets use-case requirements, and how to use it. In this paper, we aim at providing the community with such a vademecum, while giving a general presentation of blockchain that goes beyond its usage in Bitcoin and surveying a selection of the vast literature that emerged in the last few years.

Differently from native coins, crypto tokens are coins that embed some intrinsic values somehow linked to the quality of the issuing entity's business model and to the ecosystem it generates. This chapter explores the emergent start-up token funding model of Initial Coin Offering, which allows entrepreneurs to bypass the traditional capital market by issuing crypto tokens directly to investors. The positive feedback loop between an issuer's business model and the token funding model will be demystified.","[Tasca, Paolo] UCL, Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England","University of London; University College London","Tasca, P (corresponding author), UCL, Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England.","P.Tasca@ucl.ac.uk","","","","","","","34","4","4","2","15","PALGRAVE","BASINGSTOKE","HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, ENGLAND","","","978-3-030-02330-0; 978-3-030-02329-4","PALGR ST DIG BUS ENA","","","2019","","","","","","","135","148","","10.1007/978-3-030-02330-0_9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-02330-0_9","10.1007/978-3-030-02330-0","","14","Business; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications","Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)","Business & Economics; Computer Science","BN6XE","","hybrid","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000486468300010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Through the novel combination of a Bloom filter and an Invertible Bloom Lookup Table (IBLT), Graphene uses a fraction of the network bandwidth used by deployed work for one-and two-way synchronization. We show that, for this specific problem, Graphene is more efficient at reconciling n items than using a Bloom filter at the information theoretic bound. We contribute a fast and implementation-independent algorithm for parameterizing an IBLT so that it is optimally small in size and meets a desired decode rate with arbitrarily high probability. We characterize our performance improvements through analysis, detailed simulation, and deployment results for Bitcoin Cash, a prominent cryptocurrency.

Blockchain platforms introduce a decentralized mode of control are rapidly being developed in the world on a large scale and their survey along with their characteristics are being discussed in this paper. But since developing Blockchain applications on a Blockchain network are more costly, there is a need for a simulation platform to refine and test the applications before it can be committed to the network There are a huge number of Blockchain simulation platforms available.

Furthermore, we test our models' adequacy at detecting bullish and bearish regimes by devising mock investment strategies on our models and assessing how profitable they are with unseen data in comparison to a buy-and-hold approach. We ultimately show that while our modelling approach yields positive results in both Bitcoin/USD and S&P 500, and both are best modelled by four-state HSMMs, Bitcoin/USD so far shows different regime volatility and persistence patterns to the one we are used to seeing in traditional stock markets.","[Suda, David; Spiteri, Luke] Univ Malta, Dept Stat & Operat Res, MSD-2080 Msida, Malta","University of Malta","Suda, D (corresponding author), Univ Malta, Dept Stat & Operat Res, MSD-2080 Msida, Malta.","david.suda@um.edu.mt; luke.spiteri.13@um.edu.mt","","Spiteri, Luke/0000-0002-7290-2025","European Social Fund/ENDEAVOUR Scholarships Scheme","European Social Fund/ENDEAVOUR Scholarships Scheme","The research work carried out, was partially funded by the European Social Fund/ENDEAVOUR Scholarships Scheme.","","19","0","0","0","1","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","1865-1348","1865-1356","978-3-030-36691-9; 978-3-030-36690-2","LECT NOTES BUS INF P","","","2019","373","","","","","","195","207","","10.1007/978-3-030-36691-9_17","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-36691-9_17","","","13","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Operations Research & Management Science","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science","BQ6EY","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000611408800017","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The Maxwell protocol, a cryptographic proof of liabilities scheme which relies on a data structure well known as the summation Merkle tree, utilizes a Merkle approach to prove liabilities in the decentralized setting, i.e., clients independently verify they are in the dataset without any trusted auditor's involvement. In this paper, we go into the Maxwell protocol and the summation Merkle tree. We formalize the Maxwell protocol and show it is not secure. We present an attack with which the proved liabilities are less than the actual values when adopting the Maxwell protocol. This attack can have significant consequences: A Bitcoin exchange controlling a total of n client accounts can present valid liabilities proofs including only one account balance. We suggest two improvements to deal with this problem, and we present a formal proof for the improvement that is closest in spirit to the Maxwell protocol. Moreover, we show the DAM scheme, a micropayment scheme of Zerocash which adopts the Maxwell protocol as a tool to disincentivize double/multiple spending, is vulnerable to a multi-spending attack. We show the Provisions scheme, which adopts the Maxwell protocol to extend its privacy-preserving proof of liabilities, is also infected by a similar attack. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It can be used for the implementation of automated processes such as device/system control, process control, distributed computing and storage and others. The system provides a solution which uses a blockchain to control a process executing on a computing resource. In a preferred implementation, the computing re-source, running simultaneously and in parallel to the blockchain, manages a loop-based operation. The computing resource continuously monitors the state of the blockchain as well as any other off-blockchain input data or source. The execution of the loop is influenced by the state of the block-chain. Each iteration of the loop that is executed by the computing resource is recorded in a transaction that is written to the blockchain. It is stored as a hash within the transaction's metadata. If the computing resource finds a transaction which contains a hash relating to the loop it accesses the relevant portion of code. The loop contains a conditional statement which enables the computing resource to decide which action to take. The condition may be dependent upon the state of the blockchain or any other data source. The action can be any type of action, on or off the blockchain. Thus, the combi-nation of the computing resource and blockchain provide a solution which is (at least partially) Turing-complete.","[Wright, Craig S.] CNAM, Paris, France","heSam Universite; Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay","Wright, CS (corresponding author), CNAM, Paris, France.","c.wright@nchain.com","","","","","","","20","1","1","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2474-0438","","978-1-7281-1820-8","INT MULTICONF SYST","","","2019","","","","","","","300","308","","","","","","9","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering","BO5NF","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000518383300053","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Currently, cryptocurrency transactions do not allow a sender to modify or cancel a transaction that has been sent to a wrong address or person. There is no way for the user to retrieve the funds, and the receiver may not return any coins or data. Thus, if a user sends a coin or data to a wrong or non-existent party the coin or data is permanently lost once the transaction is accepted in the blockchain. Current blockchain frameworks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum share this unidirectional technical standard. It is also possible to make it appear that a recipient is taking a bribe by sending them cryptocurrency without their permission. We define a new protocol of pre-authorization in which all parties agree and sign, and the blockchain ratifies the resulting agreement. While nothing will eliminate all risk of error and fraud, this proposal will prevent these kinds of losses.","[Alruwaili, Anwar; Kruger, Dov] Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA","Stevens Institute of Technology","Alruwaili, A (corresponding author), Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA.","aalruwai@stevens.edu; dkruger@stevens.edu","","","","","","","7","2","2","1","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-2138-3","","","","2019","","","","","","","177","182","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BO7WF","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000525754800034","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The reason why those blockchain currencies based on proof of work are unstable may be found in their designs that the supplies of currencies do not respond to their positive and negative demand shocks, as the authors have formulated in our past work. Continuing from our past work, this paper proposes minimal changes to the design of blockchain currencies so that their market prices are automatically stabilized, absorbing both positive and negative demand shocks of the currencies by autonomously controlling their supplies. Those changes are: 1) limiting re-adjustment of proof-of-work targets, 2) making mining rewards variable according to the observed over-threshold changes of block intervals, and 3) enforcing negative interests to remove old coins in circulation. We have made basic design checks and evaluations of these measures through simple simulations. In addition to stabilization of prices, the proposed measures may have effects of making those currencies preferred means for payment by disincentivizing hoarding, and improving sustainability of the currency systems by making rewards to miners perpetual.

This revolution challenges the limits among physical, digital and biological spheres and, for the first time in history, human intelligence and creativity - things that were considered unique - could be, in time, substituted by robots with artificial intelligence. All of those chances will deeply reshape our way of life, national and global economy and even politics. In this article, I will focus on how technology is going to influence developing countries, and I will discuss the case of the Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICT4D). This is a new field of the Development studies, which aims to see how devices or techniques that apply knowledge in order to process or communicate data deliver some aspects of a development agenda in a developing country. As part of the 4IR and ICT4D, I will focus on Blockchain - and on its most relevant example, Bitcoin. This is an emerging technology that strives to add value in economy by eliminating third parties from financial transactions (such as banks) and to reinforce trust between individuals that want to cooperate in a variety of social and economic fields. Consequently, my goal in this paper is to answer the following question: How can Blockchain technology's features help developing countries? I will try to answer this question by correlating the development agenda of a developing country (consisting in economic growth, poverty and livelihoods, social development, eGovernance or environmental sustainability) with the most important features of Blockchain technology. Also, for each correlation I will find relevant examples of successfully implemented Blockchain projects. In the final part of the paper I will show how Blockchain can significantly impact the development agenda of each country that has already joined the race for economic, political and social development.","[Caradaica, Mihail] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Bucharest, Romania","National University of Political Studies & Public Administration","Caradaica, M (corresponding author), Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Bucharest, Romania.","mihai.caradaica@dri.snspa.ro","","","","","","","10","0","0","1","1","FILODIRITTO PUBLISHER","BOLOGNA","INFOROMATICA SRL, VIA CASTIGLIONE, 81, BOLOGNA, 40124, ITALY","","","978-88-85813-41-0","","","","2019","","","","","","","57","64","","","","","","8","Political Science","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Government & Law","BS4SX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000722431500007","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Learners will be awarded badges, which are certified for a predetermined level of progress in terms of learning. All the badges are stored in a backpack, which is an environment for storing and presenting the obtained badges. Badges are immutable and verifiable as well as rigid. The use of badges in the education system makes education more interesting, skill-based, and adaptable to changes. The key contribution of our work is in terms of compatibility with Openbadge specification and integrated cooperating platform between digital badge awarding and blockchaining. Our system implementation is compatible with Open Badges of IMS Global Learning Consortium, which is used to earn, issue, and award badges across various platforms. The badges are trusted by the IMS standard, the criteria to earn a badge is verified through the network, and the overall process is transparent compared to the traditional education system. Moreover, all badge awarding events in our system are recorded in a blockchain. Once stored, the contents cannot be tampered with. Thereafter, anyone can check the validity of the badge through the blockchain. Our platform will be useful for distance learning as well as time and location independent learning. The experimental results are as follows. On a Bitcoin-based digital badge publishing platform, the execution time required to award the badge is 24.53 s, while on the Ethereum-based digital badge publishing platform, the execution time to award the badge is only 3.86 s. It can also be used for career management and personal history. The learners can obtain the current knowledge required for a job. Lifelong learning will be also possible with this platform.","[Choi, Min; Kiran, Shinde Rupali] Chungbuk Natl Univ, Dept Informat & Commun Engn, Cheongju 28644, South Korea; [Oh, Se-Chang] Saltlux, Seoul 06147, South Korea; [Kwon, Oh-Young] Korea Univ Technol & Educ, Dept Comp Engn, Cheonan 31253, South Korea","Chungbuk National University; Korea University of Technology & Education","Kwon, OY (corresponding author), Korea Univ Technol & Educ, Dept Comp Engn, Cheonan 31253, South Korea.","mchoi@cbnu.ac.kr; rupali@cbnu.ac.kr; sechang@gmail.com; oykwon@koreatech.ac.kr","","","project for Cooperative R&D between Industry, Academy, and Research Institute [S2599713]; National Research Foundation [NRF-2017R1E1A1A01075128]","project for Cooperative R&D between Industry, Academy, and Research Institute; National Research Foundation","This research was supported by project for Cooperative R&D between Industry, Academy, and Research Institute funded Korea Ministry of SMEs and Startups, grant number S2599713, in 2018 and supported by the National Research Foundation, grant number NRF-2017R1E1A1A01075128.","","15","5","5","2","14","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2076-3417","","APPL SCI-BASEL","Appl.

Essentially, in Proof-of-Work-based consensus protocol, the miners generate a series of blocks to realize decentralization practical. Miners receive two types of revenue: block rewards and transaction fees, in which the reward of block drops off as time goes on. Carlsten et al. defined a mining gap and then Tsabary et al. analyzed the gap game exploring how mining gaps form. In this paper, we analyze the other implications of the gap game. First, it is well known that the security of Bitcoin decentralized consensus protocol relies on miners behaving correctly. The security of the blockchain system will be threatened in case of the consensus mechanism is breached. Therefore, we also described how the gap game impacts the decentralization of Bitcoin and the stability of blockchain. Second, to confirm the implication, we discuss what aspects of decentralization can be impacted by the gap game; then we defined a new decentralization model and listed its main features. In the end, we analyze the block reward capacity in the blockchain and consider the impact on the existing two common block reward systems when the gap game was formed.","[Liu, Yiran; Ke, Junming] Shandong Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Jinan 25100, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Xu, Qiuliang; Jiang, Han] Shandong Univ, Sch Software, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hao] Shandong Normal Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Jinan 250358, Shandong, Peoples R China","Shandong University; Shandong University; Shandong Normal University","Xu, QL (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Sch Software, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China.","xql@sdu.edu.cn","","Wang, Hao/0000-0003-3472-3699","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61572294, 61602287]; State Key Program of National Natural Science of China [61632020]; Major Innovation Project of Science and Technology of Shandong Province [2018CXGC0702]; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2017MF021]; Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University [2017JC019]; Primary Research and Development Plan of Shandong Province [2018GGX101037]; Development and Construction Funds Project of National Independent Innovation Demonstration Zone in Shandong Peninsula [S190101010001]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Program of National Natural Science of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Innovation Project of Science and Technology of Shandong Province; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University; Primary Research and Development Plan of Shandong Province; Development and Construction Funds Project of National Independent Innovation Demonstration Zone in Shandong Peninsula","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61572294, 61602287, in part by the State Key Program of National Natural Science of China under Grant 61632020, in part by the Major Innovation Project of Science and Technology of Shandong Province under Grant 2018CXGC0702, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province under Grant ZR2017MF021, in part by the Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University under Grant 2017JC019, in part by the Primary Research and Development Plan of Shandong Province under Grant 2018GGX101037, and in part by the Development and Construction Funds Project of National Independent Innovation Demonstration Zone in Shandong Peninsula under Grant S190101010001.","","25","4","4","6","10","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2019","7","","","","","","90999","91008","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2927257","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2927257","","","10","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","IM3AP","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000477864400018","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Evidence reveals that Bitcoin is the most influential among digital coins mainly as a transmitter toward digital currencies but also as a receiver of spillovers from virtual currencies and alternative assets. Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple present the most significant interlinkages with Bitcoin. Return spillovers are more pronounced but volatility spillovers often present a bi-directional character. Volatility shock transmission is detected among Bitcoin and national currencies, while economic policy uncertainty is not influential.

The interactions between humans and machines are intense and their synergistic reactions have attracted special attention for the reason of forming so called Human-Machine Networks (HMN). HMNs refer to these networks where humans and machines work together to provide synergistic effects on their payoffs. Game theory, which can capture the interactions among players dexterously, has been widely used in solving various problems in HMN systems from the view of economics. In this paper, we extensively review the literature about game theoretical methods in HMNs, in particular focusing on its typical systems such as crowdsourcing, an elemental HMN and Internet of Things (IoT), a hybrid HMN, as well as Bitcoin. We propose a series of requirements to evaluate existing work. For reviewing and analyzing each system, we specify application purposes, players, strategies, game models and equilibria based on our proposed requirements. In the sequel, we identify a number of common and distinct open issues in HMNs and point out future research directions. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Since IoT devices have small memory capacities and low-power processors, many security firms have not been able to develop anti-malware software for these devices. Current IoT security solutions are heavy and unreliable. We have developed a lightweight IoT security solution that uses hacker tools against the hackers - in essence, a vaccine for IoT.

Empirical results show evidence of a significant asymmetric characteristic from the cross-correlation, that is found to be persistent and multifractal in most of the cases.

Unfortunately, the locations of features in code and other characteristics (feature facets), relevant for evolution and maintenance, are often poorly documented. Since developers change, and knowledge fades with time, such information often needs to be recovered. Modern projects boast a richness of information sources, such as pull requests, release logs, and otherwise specified domain knowledge. However, it is largely unknown from what sources the features, their locations, and their facets can be recovered. We present an exploratory study on identifying such information in two popular, variant-rich, and long-living systems: The 3D-printer firmware Marlin and the Android application Bitcoin-wallet. Besides the available information sources, we also investigated the projects' communities, communications, and development cultures. Our results show that a multitude of information sources (e.g., commit messages and pull requests) is helpful to recover features, locations, and facets to different extents. Pull requests were the most valuable source to recover facets, followed by commit messages and the issue tracker. As many of the studied information sources are, so far, rarely exploited in techniques for recovering features and their facets, we hope to inspire researchers and tool builders with our results.

Then, we estimate four GARCH-type models that capture short memory (GARCH), asymmetry (APARCH), strong persistence (IGARCH), and long memory (FIGARCH) from (i) original returns, (ii) jump-filtered returns, and (iii) jump-filtered returns with structural breaks. Results indicate the importance to take into account the jumps and structural breaks in modelling volatility of the cryptocurrencies.

In the article I show the shortcomings of using the existing legal concepts to regulate cryptocurrencies, and additionally show that in practice and financially, they have not yet achieved the necessary importance to force traditional concepts used to regulate currency upon them. The argument goes in line with previous literature that claims that current suggestions to regulate cryptocurrencies do not risk inhibiting their development, but risk shallow and ineffective regulation that might damage particular actors like early-adopters or those willing to experiment with newer technologies.","[Barroilhet Diez, Agustin] Univ Chile, Fac Derecho, Derecho Econ, Santiago, Chile","Universidad de Chile","Diez, AB (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Derecho, Derecho Econ, Santiago, Chile.","abarroilhet@derecho.uchile.cl","","","","","","","84","3","3","0","12","UNIV CHILE, FAC DERECHO","SANTIAGO DE CHILE","PIO NONO NO 1, PROVIDENCIA, SANTIAGO DE CHILE, 00000, CHILE","0719-2576","0719-2584","","REV CHIL DERECHO TEC","Rev.

We also hypothesize that the unconventional monetary policy namely, Quantitative Easing (QE), is an underlying factor that has sustained the evolution of cryptocurrencies. We advance the literature by accounting for the role QE in the Bitcoin predictability of stock returns. Essentially, we extend the bivariate single factor Bitcoin-based predictive model propose by Salisu et al. (2018) to a multifactor cryptocurrency-based predictive model. Our findings are as follow: (i) when QE is measured directly, the single predictive model seems to be the preferred model; (ii) when QE is measured indirectly, via some transmission channels, the multi-factor based predictive model tend to outperform the single-factor model and (iii) relative to the historical average, the multi-factor based predictive model is the more accurate model to forecast stock returns. These results are robust to different methods of forecast performance evaluation measures and different sub-sample periods. These results have important policy implications for the investors and policymakers.

Furnham, and The Baseline Confidence Scale by L. Haff. Confirmatory factor analysis proved the three-factor structure of the questionnaire. A linear regression analysis showed that beliefs in the potential of cryptocurrency as a payment instrument are directly related to people-centered care and value of freedom, and are inversely related to sanctity; they are associated positively with confidence in the financial system and negatively with confidence in the government. Age and gender also matter. Worries about the introduction of cryptocurrency are directly related to a negative attitude to money, the value of self-confidence, age, and confidence in the financial system and government, and are inversely related to trust in people and money anxiety. Willingness to use cryptocurrency in perspective directly depends on trust in the power of money, orientation towards independence in actions, age, and gender, and is inversely dependent on confidence in the government. The data state that the intention to use cryptocurrency is directly related to the desire for financial autonomy and distrust of social institutions.","[Gagarina, Maria] FSEE HE Financial Univ, Dept HR Management & Psychol, Moscow 125993, Russia; [Gagarina, Maria; Nestik, Timofey; Drobysheva, Tatiana] Russian Acad Sci, FSFES Inst Psychol, Lab Social & Econ Psychol, Moscow 129366, Russia","Russian Academy of Sciences","Gagarina, M (corresponding author), FSEE HE Financial Univ, Dept HR Management & Psychol, Moscow 125993, Russia.;Gagarina, M (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, FSFES Inst Psychol, Lab Social & Econ Psychol, Moscow 129366, Russia.","mgagarina224@gmail.com; nestik@gmail.com; tdrobysheva@mail.ru","Gagarina, Maria/AAD-3036-2019; Nestik, Tim A/A-4640-2017","Gagarina, Maria/0000-0002-7812-7875; Nestik, Tim A/0000-0002-1410-4762; Drobysheva, Tatiana/0000-0002-9578-4463","Russian Science Foundation [18-18-00439]","Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF))","This research was funded by the Russian Science Foundation grant number 18-18-00439.","","33","3","3","7","16","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2076-328X","","BEHAV SCI-BASEL","Behav.

Based on the classification of payment systems as 'one-sided' and 'two-sided' we use mathematical methods to predict their behavior over time. By introducing the fatigue factor and involvement factor, we draw the differential equation that could be used for the analysis of the payment systems' behavior. The analysis shows that any changes in the initial state of the system fade over time; one-time circumstantial changes (such as sudden regulatory change or promotional campaign) have an only temporary effect. Our equations can also be used to identify the prevailing type of transactions (P2P or C2B) in `mixed' systems. Our model is verified by empirical data from payment card statistics, Web-Money registration rate and can be used to analyze Bitcoin usage as well. Further, research on using the model to explain and predict the competitive effects is also proposed. This is the first attempt at using differential equations for payment system analysis with a model verified by empirical evidence.","[Dostov, Victor] St Petersburg State Univ, Fed State Budgetary Educ Inst Higher Educ, 7-9 Univ Skaya Emb, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Shoust, Pavel] Russian Elect Money & Remittance Assoc, 5-2 Orlikov Per, Moscow 107078, Russia; [Popova, Elizaveta] St Petersburg Natl Res Univ Informat Technol Mech, 49 Kronverkskiy Prospect, St Petersburg 197101, Russia","Saint Petersburg State University; ITMO University","Shoust, P (corresponding author), Russian Elect Money & Remittance Assoc, 5-2 Orlikov Per, Moscow 107078, Russia.","dostov@npaed.ru; shoust@npaed.ru; popova.elizaveta@list.ru","Shust, Pavel/P-1632-2018","Shust, Pavel/0000-0002-2276-7523; Dostov, Victor/0000-0003-4518-2883; Popova, Elizaveta/0000-0001-5547-5191","","","","","14","3","3","0","1","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-24296-1","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2019","11620","","","","","","457","471","","10.1007/978-3-030-24296-1_36","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-24296-1_36","","","15","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR6JD","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000661304100036","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The 2-dimensional study is on Bitcoin and Litecoin while the 3-dimensional study is on Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple. Records from 28-April-2013 to 10-February-2018 provide forecasting values for Bitcoin and Litecoin through 2-dimensional GLVM study, while records from 7-August-2013 to 10-February-2018 provide forecasting values of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple through 3-dimensional GLVM study. The behaviour of Bitcoin and Litecoin or both Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple in future is proposed by looking at the 100 last forecasting values of n-dimensional GLVM study, n = {2, 3}. Lyapunov exponents of the 2 and 3-dimensional Lotka-Volterra models reveals that it is a chaotic dynamical system. Plots of 2 and 3-dimensional Lotka-Volterra models for filtered datasets suggest also a chaos. Using the mean absolute percentage error criterion, it was found that the accuracy of the GLVM is better than that of the grey model (GM(1,1)). By analysing the 2-dimensional GLVM, Bitcoin and Litecoin are found in the competition known as mutualism or equivalently a win-win situation where Bitcoin transaction is constant while Litecoin transaction has the increasing trend. The 3-dimensional GLVM analysis evokes however, an increasing trend in transacting both Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple where Bitcoin keep relatively higher transaction counts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The transactions carried out in this register are recorded in blocks, these blocks are linked to each other and each new transaction must be kept unchanged with the information of the previous transactions in order to be approved. For this reason, blockchain technology is considered to be a technology that eliminates intermediary institutions, offers equal opportunities to every participant and is almost impossible to manipulate. In particular, the digital currency, referred to as co Bitcoin, is based on this technology, but blockchain technology is not limited to this. There is no uniform appearance of the blockchain technology. Smart contracts, which provide a framework for transactions on the blockchain network, allow system participants to make many different transactions among them by simply going beyond crypto currency transactions. However, blockchain technology based on the principle that the transaction history cannot be changed and the smart contracts associated with this technology also bring many problems in terms of data protection law and law of obligations. The aim of this study is to evaluate block-chain technology in terms of our current legal order, especially in terms of data protection law and law of obligations.","[Cekin, Mesut Serdar] Turk Alman Univ, Hukuk Fak, Medeni Hukuk Anabilim Dali, Istanbul, Turkey","Turkish German University","Cekin, MS (corresponding author), Turk Alman Univ, Hukuk Fak, Medeni Hukuk Anabilim Dali, Istanbul, Turkey.","cekin@tau.edu.tr","","","","","","","18","0","0","0","20","ISTANBUL UNIV, FAC LAW","ISTANBUL","ISTANBUL UNIV, FAC LAW, ISTANBUL, 34116, TURKEY","2636-7734","2667-6974","","ISTANB HUKUK MECMUAS","Istanb.

With features such as decentralized consensus and data immutability, blockchain transactions are known to be transparent, secure, and trustworthy. For these reasons, blockchain is increasingly being adopted in different industries and for diverse use cases, especially where security and trust are important concerns. Health care is one such industry that offers several use cases for applying blockchain technology. Even so, blockchain-based healthcare applications have yet to become widespread. This is mostly because initial efforts were focused on developing blockchain frameworks for cryptocurrencies and not for general purpose applications, such as health care. Recently, general-purpose blockchain frameworks, which may be used to develop healthcare applications, have begun to emerge. However, there is no consensus on which framework is most suitable for developing healthcare applications. In light of this, this paper compares the popular general-purpose blockchain frameworks, vis-a-vis the requirements for healthcare systems, in order to guide health informatics researchers and practitioners in selecting the appropriate platform for developing and experimenting with blockchain-based healthcare applications.","[Agbo, Cornelius C.; Mahmoud, Qusay H.] Ontario Tech Univ, Dept Elect Comp & Software Engn, Oshawa, ON, Canada","","Agbo, CC (corresponding author), Ontario Tech Univ, Dept Elect Comp & Software Engn, Oshawa, ON, Canada.","cornelius.agbo@uoit.ca","","Agbo, Cornelius/0000-0002-3625-4729","","","","","13","15","15","3","31","JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD","CHICHESTER","THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND","","2476-1508","","INTERNET TECHNOL LET","Internet.

The 2-dimensional study is on Bitcoin and Litecoin, while the 3-dimensional study is on Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ripple. Dataset from 28 April 2013 to 10 February 2018 provides forecasting values for Bitcoin and Litecoin through the 2-dimensional FGLVM study, while dataset from 7 August 2013 to 10 February 2018 provides forecasting values of Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ripple through the 3-dimensional FGLVM study. Forecasting values of cryptocurrencies for the n-dimensional FGLVM study, along 100 days of study time, are displayed. The graph and Lyapunov exponents of the 2-dimensional Lotka-Volterra system using the results of FGLVM reveal that the system is a chaotic dynamical system, while the 3-dimensional Lotka-Volterra system displays parabolic patterns in spite of the chaos indicated by the Lyapunov exponents. The mean absolute percentage error indicates that 2-dimensional FGLVM has a good accuracy for the overall forecasting values of Bitcoin and a reasonable accuracy for the last 300 forecasting values of Litecoin, while the 3-dimensional FGLVM has a good accuracy for the overall forecasting values of Bitcoin and a reasonable accuracy for the last 300 forecasting values of both Litecoin and Ripple. Both 2- and 3-dimensional FGLVM analyses evoke a future constant trend in transacting Bitcoin and a future decreasing trend in transacting Litecoin and Ripple. Bitcoin will keep relatively higher transaction counts, with Litecoin transaction counts everywhere superior to that of Ripple.","[Gatabazi, P.; Mba, J.

This is mainly due to its novel consensus algorithm, which is based on proof-of-work combined with a cryptographically-protected data structure and a rewarding scheme that incentivizes nodes to participate. However, despite its unprecedented success Bitcoin suffers from many inefficiencies. For instance, Bitcoin's consensus mechanism has been proved to be incentive-incompatible, its high reward variance causes centralization, and its hardcoded deflation raises questions about its long-term sustainability. In this work, we revise the Bitcoin consensus mechanism by proposing StrongChain, a scheme that introduces transparency and incentivizes participants to collaborate rather than to compete. The core design of our protocol is to reflect and utilize the computing power aggregated on the blockchain which is invisible and wasted in Bitcoin today. Introducing relatively easy, although important changes to Bitcoin's design enables us to improve many crucial aspects of Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies making it more secure, efficient, and profitable for participants. We thoroughly analyze our approach and we present an implementation of StrongChain. The obtained results confirm its efficiency, security, and deployability.","[Szalachowski, Pawel; Reijsbergen, Daniel; Homoliak, Ivan; Sun, Siwei] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Singapore, Singapore; [Sun, Siwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Siwei] Chinese Acad Sci, DCS Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China","Singapore University of Technology & Design; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Engineering, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Szalachowski, P (corresponding author), Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Singapore, Singapore.","","Homoliak, Ivan/V-7525-2019","Homoliak, Ivan/0000-0002-0790-0875","National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, under its National Cybersecurity RD Programme [NRF2016NCR-NCR002-028]; ST Electronics; NRF under Corporate Laboratory @ University Scheme","National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, under its National Cybersecurity RD Programme; ST Electronics; NRF under Corporate Laboratory @ University Scheme","This work was supported in part by the National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, under its National Cybersecurity R&D Programme (Award No. NRF2016NCR-NCR002-028) and administered by the National Cybersecurity R&D Directorate, and by ST Electronics and NRF under Corporate Laboratory @ University Scheme (Programme Title: STEE Infosec - SUTD Corporate Laboratory).","","47","10","11","0","0","USENIX ASSOC","BERKELEY","SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA","","","978-1-939133-06-9","","","","2019","","","","","","","819","836","","","","","","18","Computer Science, Information Systems","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO3AB","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000509775000047","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The analysis is based on a new algorithm which allows to construct multi-annual, consistent time series of Google search volume indices (SVIs) on various frequencies. As cryptocurrencies are actively traded on a continuous basis and react very fast to new information, we conduct the analysis initially on a daily basis, lifting the data imposed restriction faced by previous research. In line with the literature on financial markets, we find that returns are not predictable while volatility is predictable to some extent. We discuss a number of reasons why the predictive power is poor. One aspect is the observational frequency which is therefore varied. The results of unpredictable cryptocurrency returns hold on higher (hourly) and lower (weekly) frequencies. Volatility, in contrast, is predictable on all frequencies and we document an increasing accuracy of the forecast when the sampling frequency is lowered.","[Bleher, Johannes; Dimpfl, Thomas] Univ Tubingen, Sch Business & Econ, Sigwartstr 18, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen","Bleher, J (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Sch Business & Econ, Sigwartstr 18, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.","johannes.bleher@uni-tuebingen.de; thomas.dimpfl@uni-tuebingen.de","Dimpfl, Thomas/AGJ-1270-2022; Dimpfl, Thomas/X-3909-2019","Dimpfl, Thomas/0000-0003-3415-7412; Dimpfl, Thomas/0000-0003-3415-7412","","","","","54","22","22","1","16","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1057-5219","1873-8079","","INT REV FINANC ANAL","Int.

Bitcoin and Litecoin then both three cryptocurrencies transaction counts are modeled in 2 and 3-dimensional framework respectively. Dataset include transaction counts of cryptocurrencies of interest. The 2-dimensional model uses Bitcoin and Litecoin transactions from April, 28, 2013 to February, 10, 2018. The 3-dimensional model uses transactions from August, 7, 2013 to February, 10, 2018. The actual values and the model values of n-dimensional model n = {2, 3} are displayed. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) suggests a high accuracy of the 3-dimensional Variable-order Fractional Lotka-Volterra model (VFGLVM) for the overall model values of Bitcoin and a reasonable accuracy for both model values of Litecoin and Ripple. The 2-dimensional VFGLVM has a good accuracy for the overall forecasting values of Bitcoin and a reasonable accuracy for the forecasting values of Litecoin. By analysing values of Lyapunov exponents and patterns of the corresponding Lotka-Volterra models, the 2 and 3-dimensional models show a chaotic behavior. Forecasting values indicate a future slight linear increase in transacting Bitcoin and a future decreasing transaction of Litecoin and Ripple. Bitcoin will keep relatively higher transaction counts and Litecoin transaction counts will be everywhere higher than that of Ripple. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The main property that contract signing protocols must achieve is fairness of the exchange. The solutions presented to date are divided into two major types: those that have a trusted third party (TTP) to achieve fairness and those that do not. In the literature, we find more than 40 published proposals, but none of these proposed protocols has become a recognized or de facto standard in the market. Blockchain has provided a new way to address classic problems such as double spending, as well as problems such as fairness. In this article, we present a protocol for contract signing based on blockchain. Our proposed protocol does not require a conventional TTP, and it does not present the disadvantages of solutions without a TTP (computational and/or communication cost). The protocol satisfies the necessary security requirements: fairness, timeliness and non-repudiation. We demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol with a cost analysis and a proof of concept implementation. In addition, we show how Ethereum can be integrated in our solution as an alternative platform to the use of Bitcoin. Finally, we show how our proposal improves previous solutions for contract signing based on blockchain in terms of cost, efficiency and security.","[Ferrer-Gomila, Josep-Lluis; Francisca Hinarejos, M.; Isern-Deya, Andreu-Pere] Univ Balearic Isl UIB, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Cra Valldemossa,Km 7-5, Palma De Mallorca, Illes Balears, Spain","Universitat de les Illes Balears","Hinarejos, MF (corresponding author), Univ Balearic Isl UIB, Palma De Mallorca, Illes Balears, Spain.","xisca.hinarejos@uib.es","Hinarejos, M.

Since then, several cryptocurrencies, tokens and ICOs have emerged. After much speculation and hype, significant number of them have become problematic or worthless! The public blockchain system Ethereum emerged by generalizing the use of blockchains to manage any kind of asset, be it physical or purely digital, with the introduction of Smart Contracts. Over the years, numerous myths have developed with respect to the purported utility and the need for public blockchains. The adoption and further adaptation of blockchains and smart contracts for use in the permissioned or private environments is what I consider to be useful and of practical consequence. Hence, the technical aspects of only private blockchain systems will be the focus of my SIGMOD 2019 keynote. Along the way, I will bust many myths associated with public blockchains. I will also compare traditional database technologies with blockchain systems' features and identify desirable future research topics.","[Mohan, C.] IBM Almaden Res Ctr, San Jose, CA 95120 USA","International Business Machines (IBM)","Mohan, C (corresponding author), IBM Almaden Res Ctr, San Jose, CA 95120 USA.","cmohan@us.ibm.com","","","","","","","47","13","15","0","9","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","0730-8078","","978-1-4503-5643-5","INT CONF MANAGE DATA","","","2019","","","","","","","404","411","","10.1145/3299869.3314116","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3299869.3314116","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO1MH","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000501538500026","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Bitcoin provides a way to transact without any trusted intermediary, but its privacy guarantees are questionable. Despite the fact that Bitcoin addresses are not linked to any identity, multiple deanonymization attacks have been proposed. Alternative cryptocurrencies such as Dash, Monero, and Zcash aim to provide stronger privacy by using sophisticated cryptographic techniques to obfuscate transaction data. Previous work in cryptocurrency privacy mostly focused on applying data mining algorithms to the transaction graph extracted from the blockchain. We focus on a less well researched vector for privacy attacks: network analysis. We argue that timings of transaction messages leak information about their origin, which can be exploited by a well connected adversarial node. For the first time, network level attacks on Bitcoin and the three major privacy-focused cryptocurrencies have been examined. We describe the message propagation mechanics and privacy guarantees in Bitcoin, Dash, Monero, and Zcash. We propose a novel technique for linking transactions based on transaction propagation analysis. We also unpack address advertisement messages (ADDR), which under certain assumptions may help in linking transaction clusters to addresses of nodes. We implement and evaluate our method, deanonymizing our own transactions in Bitcoin and Zcash with a high level of accuracy. We also show that our technique is applicable to Dash and Monero. We estimate the cost of a full-scale attack on the Bitcoin mainnet at hundreds of US dollars, feasible even for a low budget adversary.","[Biryukov, Alex; Tikhomirov, Sergei] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg","University of Luxembourg","Biryukov, A (corresponding author), Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.","alex.biryukov@uni.lu; sergey.s.tikhomirov@gmail.com","","Biryukov, Alex/0000-0003-1404-6686","","","","","51","22","22","1","8","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-1147-6","","","","2019","","","","","","","172","184","","10.1109/EuroSP.2019.00022","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EuroSP.2019.00022","","","13","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BP8ZX","","Green Submitted, Bronze","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000568610300012","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We find that Bitcoin and Ripple seem to behave as efficient financial assets, while Ethereum and Litecoin present some evidence of persistence.

Carruthers, the John D. MacArthur Professor of Sociology at North-western University was interviewed by Mayya Shmidt, master's student at Stockholm University, during his visit to the Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study based in Uppsala. During the first part of the conversation, Bruce Carruthers reflects upon the structural differences between European and North American academic settings and between sociological departments and business schools, considering graduate training and further ascending up the career ladder. He elaborates on his current research, a historical study of credit and credit decision-making in the United States in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but he also works on corporate social responsibility and taxation and the adoption of business like characteristics by US museums. Carruthers points out that working at a bunch of intersections between different branches of sociology allows him to be intellectually inclusive in his work. He shares his personal recipe for economic sociology. According to him, a good economic sociologist has to be curious about the economy and willing to do additional work and go beyond his or her sociological training to become knowledgeable in economic phenomena. Taking advantage of communication with colleagues from other fields of knowledge may also contribute to a good practice of conducting an economic sociological study. Speculating about the future of credit relations, Carruthers suggests that dystopian sci-fi TV shows pose some relevant issues to credit scoring. The combination of how widely the information can circulate and what the individual scores are based on provoke governmentality fears about ratings and rankings. As he puts it, the developing Chinese social credit system, which involves almost no privacy in relation to the State, may be nerve-racking if it gets full expression-quite the opposite future Carruthers predicts for the peer-to-peer platforms that promised to challenge the financial market. Once the promotional hype is over, as he points out, big financial institutions will likely take over the successful platforms, and tech platforms could do the business of intermediation may pop up. With respect to promising topics in sociology, Carruthers recommends directing our attention toward the incorporation of big data into research and the expansion of big data analysis skills, as the future of economic sociological research lies therein.","[Carruthers, Bruce G.] Northwestern Univ, Sociol, 1810 Chicago Ave, Evanston, IL USA","Northwestern University","","b-carruthers@northwestern.edu","Shmidt, Mayya/AAH-1042-2019","Shmidt, Mayya/0000-0001-8493-1053","","","","","6","0","0","0","11","NATL RESEARCH UNIV HIGHER SCH ECONOMICS","MOSCOW","SHABOLOVKA, 26, MOSCOW, 119049, RUSSIA","1726-3247","","","J ECON SOCIOL","J.

This qualification is, among other things, relevant to determine how bit(x)ins should be transferred, pledged, attached and executed. In this article, bitcoins and bitcoin transfers are explained from a technical perspective and subsequently qualified from a contract and property law perspective. Given the borderless nature of bitcoins and its underlying bitcoin technology, these subjects are dealt with in an international manner, often drawing upon legal concepts which form the backbone of most if not all legal systems, especially those in the EU. In this article, the following conclusions are reached. First of all, from a contract law perspective, the bitcoin network qualifies as a multi-party contract to which the various participants (users, miners and nodes) accede by participating in the network for the first time and, in doing so, accept the third-party rights clause stipulated in that agreement in their favour. Secondly, from a property law perspective, the rights with respect to the bitcoins credited to a bitcoin address are put to bearer at the same moment these bitcoins are so credited. They are put to the bearer of the value bearer on which the private key associated with that bitcoin address is stored. That value bearer embodies the right of that bearer to perform the work necessary to transfer the bitcoins on that bitcoin address, more specifically vis-a-vis the miners to validate that transaction and vis-a-vis the nodes to verify the work of the winning miner. Those bitcoin rights can be transferred, pledged, attached and executed by possession of the value bearer.","[de Graaf, Tycho] Leiden Univ, Civil Law, Leiden, Netherlands","Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC","de Graaf, T (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Civil Law, Leiden, Netherlands.","t.j.degraaf@law.leidenuniv.nl","","","","","","","38","2","2","1","2","KLUWER LAW INT","ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN","ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS","0928-9801","1875-8371","","EUR REV PRIV LAW","Eur.

In Hashcash, when a miner decides to add a block to the chain, she has to solve the difficult computational puzzle of inverting a hash function. While Hashcash has been successfully adopted in both Bitcoin and Ethereum, it has attracted significant and harsh criticism due to its massive waste of electricity, its carbon footprint and environmental effects, and the inherent lack of usefulness in inverting a hash function. Various other mining protocols have been suggested, including proof of stake, in which a miner's chance of adding the next block is proportional to her current balance. However, such protocols lead to a higher entry cost for new miners who might not still have any stake in the cryptocurrency, and can in the worst case lead to an oligopoly, where the rich have complete control over mining. In this paper, we propose Hybrid Mining: a new mining protocol that combines solving real-world useful problems with Hashcash. Our protocol allows new miners to join the network by taking part in Hashcash mining without having to own an initial stake. It also allows nodes of the network to submit hard computational problems whose solutions are of interest in the real world, e.g. protein folding problems. Then, miners can choose to compete in solving these problems, in lieu of Hashcash, for adding a new block. Hence, Hybrid Mining incentivizes miners to solve useful problems, such as hard computational problems arising in biology, in a distributed manner. It also gives researchers in other areas an easy-to-use tool to outsource their hard computations to the blockchain network, which has enormous computational power, by paying a reward to the miner who solves the problem for them. Moreover, our protocol provides strong security guarantees and is at least as resilient to double spending as Bitcoin.","[Chatterjee, Krishnendu; Goharshady, Amir Kafshdar] IST Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria; [Pourdamghani, Arash] Sharif Univ Technol, Tehran, Iran","Institute of Science & Technology - Austria; Sharif University of Technology","Chatterjee, K (corresponding author), IST Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria.","krishnendu.chatterjee@ist.ac.at; amir.goharshady@ist.ac.at; pourdamghani@ce.sharif.edu","","Pourdamghani, Arash/0000-0002-9213-1512","Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF) Project [ICT15-003]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) NFN Grant [S11407-N23]; ERC [279307]; IBM PhD Fellowship program","Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF) Project; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) NFN Grant(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); ERC(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); IBM PhD Fellowship program(International Business Machines (IBM))","The research was partially supported by Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF) Project ICT15-003, Austrian Science Fund (FWF) NFN Grant No S11407-N23 (RiSE/SHiNE), ERC Starting Grant (279307: Graph Games), and the IBM PhD Fellowship program.","","36","7","7","2","5","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","","978-1-4503-5933-7","","","","2019","","","","","","","374","381","","10.1145/3297280.3297319","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3297280.3297319","","","8","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BN1NS","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000474685800049","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Accordingly, we conduct a rolling-window analysis, and those results point to significant herding behaviour, which varies over time. Using a logistic regression, we find that herding tends to occur as uncertainty increases.

They are found to exist on distinct planar locations in the representation space, ranging from structured to stochastic-like behavior. The temporal trajectories of entropy and statistical complexity of prices vary drastically with position along the plane. Lastly cryptocurrencies appear to be characterized by ordinal patterns that represent strictly decreasing or increasing trends in price.

In this paper, we first propose a new digital signature algorithm and use it to design an online wallet, which can help the user derive the signature without obtaining the user's private key. Secondly, using our proposed online wallet, we extend the application of private key so that the cryptocurrency system can implement the authorization function. In more detail, we define a new primitive that we call decentralized hierarchical authorized payment scheme (DHAP scheme). We next propose a concrete instantiation and prove its correctness.

As a result of blockchain technology, not only Bitcoin but also various cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash are being developed. Blockchain is used in various fields because of its features such as integrity and anonymity, but it is also used for illegal transactions and drug transactions. To solve these problems, monitoring system is needed to collect data from blockchain networks and detect abuse and illegal transactions.

Cryptocurrencies provide anonymity while making transactions and have a decentralized structure when compared to other currencies. The first cryptocurrency can be traced back to the period of financial crisis (2007-08). The financial crisis pointed out the instability and the flaws of the prevalent currencies. This resulted in the introduction of a digital, decentralized currency- Bitcoin, which did not require the involvement of any third party. Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, numerous cryptocurrencies have emerged in the market. Cryptocurrency named Namecoin was introduced after Bitcoin back in the year 2011, which was later followed by Litecoin and other respective cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin obtained significant attention after its consistent rise in prices and market capitalization. In 2017, Bitcoin's price was nearly $19,000 and held a market capitalization of $314 billion USD making it the oldest, popular and highest valued cryptocurrency of all time. Currently, the market capitalization of Bitcoin has declined to $63.6 Billion and its price stands at $3,638 USD. Cryptocurrencies have observed a varied acceptance around the world. Countries like Japan, USA, Germany, Australia and many more are accepting cryptocurrencies, but these countries take some preventive measures to avoid its use for illegal transactions. Whereas, Countries like China, Vietnam, Russia, Bolivia, Columbia and Ecuador have banned the use of cryptocurrencies in their countries. Certain countries like India. Jordan, Thailand and many more remain uncertain and are yet to decide regarding its legality in their countries. Till date, a major concern remains the sustainability and stability of cryptocurrencies in the future. This paper focuses on the history of cryptocurrencies and their performance over a period 2008-17. This paper throws light on the exchange platforms and their market capitalization.","[Ratnakrishnan, Devansh; Panda, Prashant] Pandit Deendayal Petr Univ, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India","Pandit Deendayal Energy University","Ratnakrishnan, D (corresponding author), Pandit Deendayal Petr Univ, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India.","devansh.rbb15@sls.pdpu.ac.in","","","","","","","2","0","0","0","1","BC GRUP INC","CANKAYA","MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH, 2134 SOK, DERELI APT.

Blockchain seeks to improve information security and transparency by sharing encrypted data among peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Due to its emphasis on security and trust, there is increased demand for blockchain's application in a variety of business sectors. The decentralized nature of blockchain creates the new concept of a token economy in which the community's revenue can be allocated to the actual content producers and service users who create value. This article looks at how blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are evolving and interconnected, creating a token economy through different business models. Blockchain is expected to be a key technology that enables new protocols for the establishment of a token economy in the future, leading to a new economic paradigm.

In this paper, we established and validated a model for Proof-of-Work mining, introduced the concept of equivalent blocks, and quantitatively derived that pooling effectively lowers the income variance of miners. We also analyzed Bitcoin and Ethereum data to prove that pooled mining has become prevalent in the real world. The percentage of pool-mined blocks increased from 49.91% to 91.12% within four months in Bitcoin and from 76.9% to 92.2% within five months in Ethereum.

The blockchain technology underlying Bitcoin is said to be trustless because it has been designed to avoid a trusted third party. Drawing on the institutionalist approach of Aglietta and Orlean emphasizing the importance of trust in money and the monetary system, we show that Bitcoin is characterized by: (1) methodical trust through the existence of an objective proof of payment; (2) hierarchical trust due to the concentration in the mining process; and (3) ethical trust organized around the rejection of banks and the state, although the early ethical commitment is unstable. In other words, trust is now materialized in a form of technical institution, the blockchain. However, Bitcoin cannot be used as everyday money as it would bring about a deflationist and dysfunctional monetary regime, as well as high transaction costs.

However, the anonymity of Bitcoin is fragile. Many altcoins and protocols are designed to improve Bitcoin on this issue, among which Zero cash is the first full-fledged anonymous ledger-based currency, using zero-knowledge proof, specifically zk-SNARK, to protect privacy. However, Zerocash suffers two problems: Poor scalability and low efficiency. In this paper, we address the above issues by constructing a micropayment system in Zerocash called Z-Channel. First, we improve Zerocash to support multisignature and time lock functionalities, and prove that the reconstructed scheme is secure. Then we construct Z-Channel based on the improved Zerocash scheme. Our experiments demonstrate that Z-Channel significantly improves the scalability and reduces the confirmation time for Zerocash payments. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, there exist very few studies about the security of its mining strategies, especially from the selfish mining perspective. In this paper, we aim to fill this research gap by analyzing selfish mining in Ethereum and understanding its potential threat. First, we introduce a 2-dimensional Markov process to model the behavior of a selfish mining strategy inspired by a Bitcoin mining strategy proposed by Eyal and Sirer. Second, we derive the stationary distribution of our Markov model and compute long-term average mining rewards. This allows us to determine the threshold of computational power that makes selfish mining profitable in Ethereum. We find that this threshold is lower than that in Bitcoin mining (which is 25% as discovered by Eyal and Sirer), suggesting that Ethereum is more vulnerable to selfish mining than Bitcoin.","[Niu, Jianyu; Feng, Chen] Univ British Columbia, Sch Engn, Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC, Canada","University of British Columbia","Niu, JY (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Sch Engn, Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC, Canada.","jianyu.niu@ubc.ca; chen.feng@ubc.ca","","","NSERC [RGPIN-201605310]","NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","We sincerely thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and feedback as well as Arthur Gervais for useful discussions on his landmark paper [6].

Since Cyclonopedia's publication, however, Negarestani has left behind Landian nihilism to develop in his 2018 book Intelligence and Spirit a neorationalist philosophy of mind whose primary influences are Sellars, Brandom, and Hegel. At 579 clearly written yet dense pages, it is difficult even for a review article to encapsulate the book in its entirety. The first half of this article instead aims to provide a sense of the book's overall project by focusing on how Negarestani outlines and develops his neorationalist philosophy through a critique of Land's antihumanism. Never one to remain silent whilst others seek to resurrect Hegel from the dead, since December 2018, Land has been releasing a draft on his blog Urban Futures 2.1 of his new monograph Crypto-Current: Bitcoin and Philosophy, which proffers the most up to date articulation of his main antihumanist tenets. Having organized Intelligence and Spirit around Negarestani's objections to Land, this article's second half turns to Crypto-Current to see how Land is able to provide convincing responses to each of Negarestani's objections, showing some to be based on strawman characterizations, others to stem from misunderstandings of Land's position, and still others to lack traction at all. By putting Negarestani and Land's new books in combat, we will ultimately see that the grounds for Negarestani's efforts to move continental philosophy from its Kanto-Landian phase to a renewed Hegelian phase is unsuccessful in that antihumanism is able to respond to each of his objections in kind.","","","","eltnecniv@gmail.com","","","","","","","4","0","0","0","1","COSMOS PUBL COOPERATIVE","HAWTHORN","C/O ARRAN GARE, PHILOSOPHY & CULTURAL INQUIRY, PO BOX 218, HAWTHORN, VIC 3122, AUSTRALIA","1832-9101","","","COSM HIST","Cosm.

Using Bitcoin as an example, we demonstrate that if the attack is implemented successfully, a legitimate user is able to prove that fact of this attack with a high probability. We also consider two options for modification of existing cryptocurrency protocols for dealing with this type of attacks. First, we discuss a modification that requires introducing changes in the Bitcoin protocol and allows diminishing the motivation to attack wallets. Second, an alternative option is the construction of special smart-contracts, which reward the users for providing evidence of the brute-force attack. The execution of this smart-contract can work as an automatic alarm that the employed cryptographic mechanisms, and (particularly) hash functions, have an evident vulnerability.","[Kiktenko, E.

We estimate a multivariate stochastic volatility model with discontinuous jumps to mean returns and volatility. This formulation allows us to extract a time varying shared average volatility and to account for possible large outliers. Nine cryptocurrencies with roughly three years of daily price observations are considered in the sample. Our results point to two high volatility periods in 2017 and early 2018. Qualitatively, the permanent volatility component seems driven by major market developments, as well as the level of popular interest in cryptocurrencies. Transitory mean jumps become larger and more frequent starting from early 2017, further suggesting shifts in cryptocurrencies return dynamics. Calibrated simulation exercises suggest the long memory dependence features of cryptocurrencies are well reproduced by stationary models with jump components.","[Chaim, Pedro; Laurini, Marcio P.] Univ Sao Paulo, FEA RP, Dept Econ, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil","Universidade de Sao Paulo","Laurini, MP (corresponding author), Ave Bandeirantes 3900, BR-14040905 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.","laurini@fearp.usp.br","Chaim, Pedro/U-2465-2019","Chaim, Pedro/0000-0002-0134-3369","CNPq [303738/2015-4]; FAPESP [2018/04654-9]","CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP))","We thank the comments of two anonymous referees.

Bitcoin is currently one of the largest cryptocurrencies in terms of capital market share. Therefore, this study proposes that sentiment analysis can be used as a computational tool to predict the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for different time intervals. A key characteristic of the cryptocurrency market is that the fluctuation of currency prices depends on people's perceptions and opinions, not institutional money regulation. Therefore, analysing the relationship between social media and web search is crucial for cryptocurrency price prediction. This study uses Twitter and Google Trends to forecast the short-term prices of the primary cryptocurrencies, as these social media platforms are used to influence purchasing decisions. The study adopts and interpolates a unique multimodel approach to analyse the impact of social media on cryptocurrency prices. Our results prove that people's psychological and behavioural attitudes have a significant impact on the highly speculative cryptocurrency prices.","[Wolk, Krzysztof] Polish Japanese Acad Informat Technol, Dept Multimedia, Warsaw, Poland","Polsko-Japonska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","Wolk, K (corresponding author), Polish Japanese Acad Informat Technol, Koszykowa 86, PL-02008 Warsaw, Poland.","kwolk@pja.edu.pl","Wolk, Krzysztof/E-9957-2015","Wolk, Krzysztof/0000-0001-5030-334X","","","","","27","18","18","3","37","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0266-4720","1468-0394","","EXPERT SYST","Expert Syst.","APR","2020","37","2","","","","","","","e12493","10.1111/exsy.12493","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/exsy.12493","","NOV 2019","16","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science","LA1YK","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000497759200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

If miners have different energy efficiencies and are restricted to choose the same hash rate for many epochs, there is a unique pure equilibrium in which miners either participate at low levels that depend in intricate ways on all the other miners' efficiencies, or choose to abstain from mining if their efficiency is too low. In the general setting in which miners can adapt their hash rates over time, we show that, unless the number of miners is very small, the only possible pure equilibria are rather chaotic, with miners quitting and starting again periodically-or there is no pure equilibrium at all.

Bitcoin revolutionized this conventional view of a cryptocurrency, trading decentralized, distributed ledger, completely secured by the majority rule without predetermined authority or owner. Only standard cryptographic primitives such as signatures and hash functions were used to achieve security. Though other cryptocurrencies such as Bit-gold and B-money which are among the authority free cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is the first one to experience public acceptance on a large scale. There are various factors which contribute to Bitcoins success, though there is still a little question of doubt that the decentralized design of blockchain technology and perceived resilience to government or third-party intervention played an extremely crucial role in its uptake. Distributed crypto cash, more specifically in Blockchain technology has hailed as one key and most eminent and widely accepted innovation of Bitcoin. In this paper we have worked on the use of blockchain technology to implement cryptocurrency for IOT.","[Jain, Samyak; Rastogi, Umang; Bansal, Nikita; Kaur, Gagandeep] Jaypee Inst Informat Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Noida, India","Jaypee Institute of Information Technology (JIIT)","Jain, S (corresponding author), Jaypee Inst Informat Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Noida, India.","samyakb50@gmail.com; umangrastogi555@gmail.com; nikitabansal711@gmail.com; gagandeep.kaur@jiit.ac.in","RASTOGI, UMANG/ADM-6568-2022","RASTOGI, UMANG/0000-0003-2767-7348","","","","","8","4","4","1","4","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-1380-7","","","","2019","","","","","","","744","749","","","","","","6","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BM9DX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000470844100144","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Findings show that most cryptocurrencies do not significantly affect other variances, except for Monero, which represented between 19% and 45% of the variances of five cryptocurrencies. Autoregressive (AR) models are superior in forecasting one day ahead return forecasts, compared to the VAR model, whereas the random walk (RW) model ranked last. Although remarkable structural breaks are observed via impulse response functions during December 2017-January 2018, no major news announcements were released on the same day the breaks occurred.

They are not efficient payment methods, although they bring some benefits linked to the underlying technology they use (Blockchain). In reality, they function more as investment assets than as payment instruments and pose various risks, which are very similar to those encountered on capital markets (price volatility, fraud, market manipulation). In order to deal with these risks, regulation should apply to intermediaries who provide services in relation to cryptocurrencies, such as crypto wallets, operation of crypto exchanges and brokerage. To this end, the European legislator should consider two options. It could, on the one hand, bring cryptocurrency service providers within the scope of the existing financial services regime and thus modify MIFID II in order to include cryptocurrencies in the list of financial instruments. The European legislator could also, on the other hand, aim at creating a new appropriate and proportionate regime that draws on the existing one. Insofar as the existing regulatory framework was not designed with cryptocurrencies in mind and as some of the current rules may not be tailored to the specificities of these assets, the second option is preferable.","[Sotiropoulou, Anastasia] Univ Orleans, Private Law, Labex Refi, France","Universite de Orleans","Sotiropoulou, A (corresponding author), Univ Orleans, Private Law, Labex Refi, France.","","","","","","","","54","0","0","1","11","WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH","BERLIN","GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY","1613-2548","1613-2556","","EUR CO FINANC LAW R","Eur.

The industry's response to securing the user's assets is to offer tamper-resistant hardware wallets. Although such wallets are considered to be the most secure means for managing an account, no formal attempt has been previously done to identify, model and formally verify their properties. This paper provides the first formal model of the Bitcoin hardware wallet operations. We identify the properties and security parameters of a Bitcoin wallet and formally define them in the Universal Composition (UC) Framework. We present a modular treatment of a hardware wallet ecosystem, by realizing the wallet functionality in a hybrid setting defined by a set of protocols. This approach allows us to capture in detail the wallet's components, their interaction and the potential threats. We deduce the wallet's security by proving that it is secure under common cryptographic assumptions, provided that there is no deviation in the protocol execution. Finally, we define the attacks that are successful under a protocol deviation, and analyze the security of commercially available wallets.","[Arapinis, Myrto; Gkaniatsou, Andriana; Karakostas, Dimitris; Kiayias, Aggelos] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Karakostas, Dimitris; Kiayias, Aggelos] IOHK, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","University of Edinburgh","Karakostas, D (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.;Karakostas, D (corresponding author), IOHK, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.","marapini@inf.ed.ac.uk; agkaniat@ed.ac.uk; dimitris.karakostas@ed.ac.uk; aggelos.kiayias@ed.ac.uk","","","EPSRC [EP/P002692/1]; H2020 project FENTEC [780108]","EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); H2020 project FENTEC","This work was partially supported by the EPSRC grant EP/P002692/1.

However, these solutions have a number of limitations, e.g., PoW approach requires a huge amount of computational power, scales poorly, and wastes a lot of electrical energy. Recently, an innovative protocol called Algorand has been proposed to overcome these limitations. Algorand not only guarantees an overwhelming probability of linearity of the blockchain, but it also aims to solve the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, scalability, and security. In this paper, we present a security analysis of Algorand. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first security analysis as well as the first formal study on Algorand. We designed an attack scenario in which a group of malicious users tries to break the protocol, or at least limit it to a reduced partition of network users, by exploiting a security flaw in the messages validation process of the Byzantine Agreement (BA). Since the source code or an official simulator for Algorand was not available at the time of our study, we created a simulator (which is available on request) to implement the protocol and assess the feasibility of our attack scenario. Our attack requires the attacker to merely have the trivial capability of establishing multiple connections with targeted nodes, and it costs practically nothing to the attacker. Our results show that it is possible to slow down the message validation process on honest nodes - which eventually forces them to select default values on the consensus - leaving the targeted nodes behind in the chain as compared to the non-attacked nodes. Even though our results are subject to the real implementation of the protocol, the core concept of our attack remains valid.","[Conti, Mauro; Gangwal, Ankit] Univ Padua, Dept Math, Padua, Italy; [Todero, Michele] PwC Advisory SpA Italy, Cyber Security, Milan, Italy","University of Padua","Gangwal, A (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Math, Padua, Italy.","conti@math.unipd.it; ankit.gangwal@phd.unipd.it; michele.todero@studenti.unipd.it","Conti, Mauro/F-9145-2012; Gangwal, Ankit/M-3965-2017","Conti, Mauro/0000-0002-3612-1934; Gangwal, Ankit/0000-0002-8065-3700","Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Padova e Rovigo (CARIPARO); EU LOCARD Project [H2020-SU-SEC-2018-832735]; Huawei Project Secure Remote OTA Updates for In-Vehicle Software Systems [HIRPO 2018040400359-2018]","Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Padova e Rovigo (CARIPARO)(Fondazione Cariparo); EU LOCARD Project; Huawei Project Secure Remote OTA Updates for In-Vehicle Software Systems","Ankit Gangwal is pursuing his Ph.D. with a fellowship for international students funded by Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Padova e Rovigo (CARIPARO).

As such, online discussions related to cryptocurrencies often go beyond posts about the technology and underlying architecture of the various coins, to subjective speculations of price fluctuations and predictions. Furthermore, online discussions, potentially driven by foreign adversaries, criminals or hackers, can have a significant impact on our economy and national security if spread at scale. This paper is the first to qualitatively measure and contrast discussion growth about three popular cryptocurrencies with key distinctions in motivation, usage, and implementation Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Monero on Reddit. More specifically, we measure how discussions relevant to these coins spread in online social environments how deep and how wide they go, how long they last, how many people they reach, etc. More importantly, we compare user behavior patterns between the focused community of the official coin subreddits and the general community across Reddit as a whole. Our Reddit sample covers three years of data between 2015 and 2018 and includes a time period of a record high Bitcoin price rise.(1) Our results demonstrate that while the largest discussions on Reddit are focused on Bitcoin, posts about Monero (a cryptocurrency often used by criminals for illegal transactions on the Dark Web(2)) start discussions that are typically longer and wider. Bitcoin posts trigger subsequent discussion more immediately but Monero posts are more likely to trigger a longer lasting discussion. We find that moderately subjective posts across all three coins trigger larger, longer, and more viral discussion cascades within both focused and general communities on Reddit. Our analysis aims to bring the awareness to online discussion spread relevant to cryptocurrencies in addition to informing models for forecasting cryptocurrency price that rely on discussions in social media.","[Glenski, Maria] Univ Notre Dame, Comp Sci & Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Saldanha, Emily; Volkova, Svitlana] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Data Sci & Analyt Grp, Richland, WA 99352 USA","University of Notre Dame; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","Glenski, M (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Comp Sci & Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.","mglenski@nd.edu; emily.saldanha@pnnl.gov; svitlana.volkova@pnnl.gov","","","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) SocialSim program [71177]","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) SocialSim program(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA))","The research described in this paper was performed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a multiprogram national laboratory operated by Battelle for the U.S. Department of Energy.

But security and privacy have always been major concerns for most users. Among existing payment systems, PayPal as well as Alipay has a third-party payment provider (TPP) but does not provide anonymity. Bitcoin provides anonymity but its decentralized framework without TPP causes high energy consumption and security attack issues. Further information can be deduced from the public decentralized ledger, Bitcoin cannot offer strong privacy guarantees. Therefore, unifying strong anonymity, security and efficiency is challenging in mobile payment. This paper proposes a strong anonymous mobile payment against a curious third-party provider (SATP). A ticket as a new means of payment is partially blindly signed by TPP using certificateless cryptographic primitives. SATP can ensure confidentiality of payment data, non-repudiation and revocation of payment operation, and anonymity of payer's identity. Especially, it can enable a user to pay anonymously even in face of a curious TPP. Performance analysis shows that SATP avoids high energy consumption like Bitcoin, and its communication cost is less than that of the existing anonymous research work.","[Cao, Chenglong] Anhui Finance & Trade Vocat Coll, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xiaoling] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Comp & Informat, Hefei 230009, Anhui, Peoples R China","Anhui University of Finance & Economics; Hefei University of Technology","Cao, CL (corresponding author), Anhui Finance & Trade Vocat Coll, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China.","chenglongcao@sina.cn; zhuxl@hfut.edu.cn","","","Major Research Project for Social Science Innovation and Development of Anhui Province [2017ZD005]; Visiting Scholar Projects of Anhui Province for Excellent Young and Middle-aged Backbone Talents [gxfxZD2016305]; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province [1608085MF141]","Major Research Project for Social Science Innovation and Development of Anhui Province; Visiting Scholar Projects of Anhui Province for Excellent Young and Middle-aged Backbone Talents; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province)","This work was supported by the Major Research Project for Social Science Innovation and Development of Anhui Province (Grant No. 2017ZD005), the Visiting Scholar Projects of Anhui Province for Excellent Young and Middle-aged Backbone Talents (Grant No. gxfxZD2016305), and the Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province (Grant No. 1608085MF141).

The results show that tracking Coin Join transactions is a feasible task that allows to determine the fact of user participation in the creation of a transaction, which gives additional advantages in the process of detecting transactions involved in money laundering schemes.","[Maksutov, Artem A.; Alexeev, Maxim S.; Fedorova, Natalia O.; Andreev, Daniil A.] Natl Res Nucl Univ MEPhI, Dept Comp Syst & Technol, Moscow, Russia","National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute)","Maksutov, AA (corresponding author), Natl Res Nucl Univ MEPhI, Dept Comp Syst & Technol, Moscow, Russia.","AAMaksutov@mephi.ru","","","","","","","4","7","7","1","7","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2376-6557","","978-1-7281-0339-6","IEEE NW RUSS YOUNG","","","2019","","","","","","","274","277","","","","","","4","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering","BM8NI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000469452600064","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Regardless of the sign of returns, the results show that Litecoin and Bitcoin are at the centre of the connected network of returns. This finding implies that return shocks arising from these two cryptocurrencies have the most effect on other cryptocurrencies. Further analysis shows that connectedness via negative returns is largely stronger than via positive ones. Ripple and Ethereum are the top recipients of negative-return shocks, whereas Ethereum and Dash exhibit very weak connectedness via positive returns. Regarding volatility spillovers, Bitcoin is the most influential, followed by Litecoin; Dash exhibits a very weak connectedness, suggesting its utility for hedging and diversification opportunities in the cryptocurrency market. Taken together, results imply that the importance of each cryptocurrency in return and volatility connectedness is not necessarily related to its market size. Further analyses reveal that trading volume and global financial and uncertainty effects as well as the investment-substitution effect are determinants of net directional spillovers. Interestingly, higher gold prices and US uncertainty increase the net directional negative-return spillovers, whereas they do the opposite for net directional positive-return spillovers. Furthermore, gold prices exhibit a negative sign for net directional-volatility spillovers, whereas US uncertainty shows a positive sign. Economic actors interested in the cryptocurrency market can build on our findings when weighing their decisions.","[Ji, Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Ji, Qiang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Bouri, Elie] Holy Spirit Univ Kaslik, USEK Business Sch, Jounieh, Lebanon; [Lau, Chi Keung Marco] Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield Business Sch, Dept Accountancy Finance & Econ, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England; [Roubaud, David] Montpellier Business Sch, Energy & Sustainable Dev, Montpellier, France","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Huddersfield; Montpellier Business School","Lau, CKM (corresponding author), Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield Business Sch, Dept Accountancy Finance & Econ, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England.","eliebouri@usek.edu.lb; c.lau@hud.ac.uk; d.roubaud@montpellier-bs.com","Ji, Qiang/AAY-1986-2021; ROUBAUD, DAVID/ABA-8123-2020; Ji, Qiang/AAA-4001-2020; Bouri, Elie/ABC-4197-2020; Lau, Chi Keung/T-7850-2019; Bouri, Elie/N-1368-2015","ROUBAUD, DAVID/0000-0003-3827-6187; Ji, Qiang/0000-0002-3502-5254; Bouri, Elie/0000-0003-2628-5027; Lau, Chi Keung/0000-0002-2430-5592; Bouri, Elie/0000-0003-2628-5027","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71774152, 91546109]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y7X0231505]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences","Supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71774152, No. 91546109 and Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant: Y7X0231505) are acknowledged.","","41","222","222","19","102","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1057-5219","1873-8079","","INT REV FINANC ANAL","Int.

For legal and ethical reasons, however, individuals and organizations might be compelled to erase locally stored data, be it encoded on a blockchain or not. The common assumption for blockchain networks like Bitcoin is that forcing nodes to erase data contained on the blockchain is equal to permanently restricting them from participating in the system in a full-node role. Challenging this belief, in this paper, we propose and demonstrate a pragmatic approach towards functionality-preserving local erasure (FPLE). FPLE enables full nodes to erase infringing or undesirable data while continuing to store and validate most of the blockchain. We describe a general FPLE approach for UTXO-based (i.e., Bitcoin-like) cryptocurrencies and present a lightweight proof-of-concept tool for safely erasing transaction data from the local storage of Bitcoin Core nodes. Erasing nodes continue to operate in tune with the network even when erased transaction outputs become relevant for validating subsequent blocks. Using only our basic proof-of-concept implementation, we are already able to safely comply with a significantly larger range of erasure requests than, to the best of our knowledge, any other full node operator so far.","[Florian, Martin; Beaucamp, Sophie; Henningsen, Sebastian; Scheuermann, Bjoern] Humboldt Univ, Weizenbaum Inst, Berlin, Germany","Humboldt University of Berlin","Florian, M (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Weizenbaum Inst, Berlin, Germany.","","","","","","","","26","26","26","3","6","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-3026-2","","","","2019","","","","","","","367","376","","10.1109/EuroSPW.2019.00047","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EuroSPW.2019.00047","","","10","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BN6IW","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000485315600041","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, recent studies have highlighted the potential for de-anonymization of bitcoin transactions, bringing into question the level of anonymity afforded by cryptomarkets. We examine a set of over 100,000 product reviews from several cryptomarkets collected in 2018 and 2019 and conduct a comprehensive analysis of the markets, including an examination of the distribution of drug sales and revenue among vendors, and a comparison of incidences of opioid sales to overdose deaths in a US city. We explore the potential for de-anonymization of vendors by implementing a Naive-Bayes classifier to predict the vendor from a given product review, and attempt to link vendors' sales to specific Bitcoin transactions. On the buyer side, we evaluate the efficacy of hierarchical agglomerative clustering for grouping together transactions corresponding to the same buyer. We find that the high degree of specialization among the small subset of high-revenue vendors may render these vendors susceptible to de-anonymization. Further research is necessary to confirm these findings, which are restricted by the scarcity of ground-truth data for validation.","[Carr, Theo] Northeastern Univ, Dept Math, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhuang, Jun; Al Hasan, Mohammad; Mohler, George] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Sablan, Dwight] Univ Guam, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Mangilao, GU USA; [LaRue, Emma] Univ Arkansas Little Rock, Dept Math & Stat, Little Rock, AR USA; [Wu, Yubao] Georgia State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA","Northeastern University; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; University of Guam; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Little Rock; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University","Carr, T (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Dept Math, Boston, MA 02115 USA.","carr.ken@husky.neu.edu; junz@iu.edu; sabland9706@gotritons.uog.edu; exlarue@ualr.edu; ywu28@gsu.edu; alhasan@iupui.edu; gmohler@iupui.edu","","Wu, Yubao/0000-0001-9356-8508","National Science Foundation Dr. Mohler and Dr. Hasan's NSF [REU-1659488]","National Science Foundation Dr. Mohler and Dr. Hasan's NSF","This research was supported by National Science Foundation Dr. Mohler and Dr. Hasan's NSF grant, numbered REU-1659488.","","31","0","0","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2639-1589","","978-1-7281-0858-2","IEEE INT CONF BIG DA","","","2019","","","","","","","1432","1441","","","","","","10","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP4WK","","Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000554828701067","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We designed and implemented MFScope, a new framework which collects Dark Web data, extracts cryptocurrency information, and analyzes their usage characteristics on the Dark Web. Specifically, MFScope collected more than 27 million dark webpages and extracted around 10 million unique cryptocurrency addresses for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Monero. It then classified their usages to identify trades of illicit goods and traced cryptocurrency money flows, to reveal black money operations on the Dark Web. In total, using MFScope we discovered that more than 80% of Bitcoin addresses on the Dark Web were used with malicious intent; their monetary volume was around 180 million USD, and they sent a large sum of their money to several popular cryptocurrency services (e.g., exchange services). Furthermore, we present two real-world unlawful services and demonstrate their Bitcoin transaction traces, which helps in understanding their marketing strategy as well as black money operations.","[Lee, Seunghyeon; Kang, Heedo; Kim, Yeonkeun; Kim, Yongdae; Han, Dongsu; Son, Sooel; Shin, Seungwon] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Daejeon, South Korea; [Lee, Seunghyeon; Yoon, Changhoon; Shin, Seungwon] S2W Lab Inc, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea","Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST)","Lee, S (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Daejeon, South Korea.;Lee, S (corresponding author), S2W Lab Inc, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.","seunghyeon@kaist.ac.kr; cy@s2wlab.com; kangheedo@kaist.ac.kr; yeonk@kaist.ac.kr; yongdaek@kaist.ac.kr; dhan.ee@kaist.ac.kr; sl.son@kaist.ac.kr; claude@kaist.ac.kr","Son, Sooel/AAE-6749-2019","Son, Sooel/0000-0003-0904-2875","","","","","53","21","21","3","7","INTERNET SOC","RESTON","1775 WIEHLE AVE, STE 201, RESTON, VA, UNITED STATES","","","978-1-891562-55-6","","","","2019","","","","","","","","","","10.14722/ndss.2019.23055","http://dx.doi.org/10.14722/ndss.2019.23055","","","15","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS0BA","","Bronze","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000680713300078","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It allows Bitcoin to scale by performing transactions off-chain to reduce load on the blockchain. Malicious payment channel participants can try to commit fraud by closing channels with outdated balances. The Lightning Network allows resolving this dispute on the blockchain. However, this mechanism forces the channels' participants to watch the blockchain in regular intervals. It has been proposed to offload this monitoring duty to a third party, called a watchtower. However, existing approaches for watchtowers do not scale as they have storage requirements linear in the number of updates in a channel. In this work, we propose TEE Guard, a new architecture for watchtowers that leverages the features of Trusted Execution Environments to build watchtowers that require only constant memory and are thus able to scale. We show that TEE Guard is deployable because it can run with the existing Bitcoin and Lightning Network protocols. We also show that it is economically viable for a third party to provide watchtower services. As a watchtower needs to be trusted to be watching the blockchain, we also introduce a mechanism that allows customers to verify that a watchtower has been running continuously.","[Leinweber, Marc; Grundmann, Matthias; Schoenborn, Leonard; Hartenstein, Hannes] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Karlsruhe, Germany","Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology","Leinweber, M (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Karlsruhe, Germany.","marc.leinweber@kit.edu; matthias.grundmann@kit.edu; leonard.schoenborn@student.kit.edu; hannes.hartenstein@kit.edu","Grundmann, Matthias/AAZ-4918-2020","Grundmann, Matthias/0000-0002-1352-0625; Leinweber, Marc/0000-0002-9638-8526","","","","","21","4","5","1","4","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-31500-9; 978-3-030-31499-6","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2019","11737","","","","","","177","194","","10.1007/978-3-030-31500-9_11","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-31500-9_11","","","18","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BP5UZ","","Green Accepted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000558296200011","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Its diffusion is related to cryptocurrency, the most widespread of which is Bitcoin. The protocol on which BCs operate sees the interaction between users, interested in performing their transactions, and miners, who certify the trust behind the transactions by putting some form of effort that allows acknowledging their trustfulness, obtaining Bitcoins in reward for their work. In the so-called proof-of-work implementation of the BC, such effort is the computational power needed to find a specific string of bits called nonce. The resulting game-theoretic setting has subtle dynamics, and its functioning could be strongly improved using closed-loop control. This work is an attempt to define a control-oriented description of the agent-based BC dynamics and offer a redesign of the difficulty control system that regulates the amount of work needed to add a new trusted block to the BC.

Besides faster verification, it is useful to reduce storage and bandwidth, and is especially attractive for blockchain and cryptocurrency. In this work, we first demonstrate the subtlety of achieving AS from general groups, by a concrete attack that actually works against the natural implementations of AS based on almost all the variants of DSA and Schnorr's. Then, we show that aggregate signature can be derived from the G-signature scheme proposed by Yao, et al. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first aggregate signature scheme from general elliptic curves without bilinear maps (in particular, the secp256k1 curve used by Bitcoin). The security of aggregate G-signature is proved based on a new assumption proposed and justified in this work, referred to as non-malleable discrete-logarithm (NMDL), which might be of independent interest. When applying the resultant aggregate G-signature to Bitcoin, the storage volume of signatures reduces about 49.8%, and the signature verification time can even reduce about 72%. Finally, we specify in detail the application of the proposed AS scheme to Bitcoin, with the goal of maximizing performance and compatibility. We adopt a Merkle-Patricia tree based implementation, and the resulting system is also more friendly to segregated witness and provides better protection against transaction malleability attacks.","[Zhao, Yunlei] Fudan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Fudan University","Zhao, YL (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.","ylzhao@fudan.edu.cn","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0802000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61472084, U1536205]; Shanghai Innovation Action Project [16DZ1100200]; Shanghai Science and Technology Development Funds [16JC1400801]; Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program of China [2017CXG0701, 2018CXGC0701]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Innovation Action Project; Shanghai Science and Technology Development Funds; Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program of China","This work is supported in part by National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant No. 2017YFB0802000, National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 61472084 and U1536205, Shanghai Innovation Action Project under Grant No. 16DZ1100200, Shanghai Science and Technology Development Funds under Grant No. 16JC1400801, and Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant Nos. 2017CXG0701 and 2018CXGC0701.","","68","11","12","0","7","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-6752-3","","","","2019","","","","","","","529","538","","10.1145/3321705.3329826","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3321705.3329826","","","10","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BP1KI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000539861300048","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Many consider blockchain as a technology breakthrough for cryptography and cybersecurity, with use cases ranging from globally deployed cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin, to smart contracts, smart grids over the Internet of Things, and so forth. Although blockchain has received growing interests in both academia and industry in the recent years, the security and privacy of blockchains continue to be at the center of the debate when deploying blockchain in different applications. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the security and privacy of blockchain. To facilitate the discussion, we first introduce the notion of blockchains and its utility in the context of Bitcoin-like online transactions. Then, we describe the basic security properties that are supported as the essential requirements and building blocks for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency systems, followed by presenting the additional security and privacy properties that are desired in many blockchain applications. Finally, we review the security and privacy techniques for achieving these security properties in blockchain-based systems, including representative consensus algorithms, hash chained storage, mixing protocols, anonymous signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, and so forth. We conjecture that this survey can help readers to gain an in-depth understanding of the security and privacy of blockchain with respect to concept, attributes, techniques, and systems.","[Zhang, Rui; Xue, Rui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, State Key Lab Informat Secur, 89 Minzhuang Rd, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Rui; Xue, Rui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Cyber Secur, 19 Yuquan Rd, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ling] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Engineering, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology","Zhang, R (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, State Key Lab Informat Secur, 89 Minzhuang Rd, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.;Zhang, R (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Cyber Secur, 19 Yuquan Rd, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.","zhangrui@iie.ac.cn; xuerui@iie.ac.cn; ling.liu@cc.gatech.edu","","Zhang, Rui/0000-0003-0002-5593","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB1400700]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61472414, 61772514, 61602061]; National Science Foundation [1564097, 1547102]; IBM faculty award","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); IBM faculty award(International Business Machines (IBM))","The first two authors acknowledge the partial support from National Key R&D Program of China under Grant No. 2017YFB1400700 and National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No.: 61472414, 61772514, 61602061.

The results from testing the existence of non-linearity revealed that the time series of all digital currencies exhibit fractal dynamics, long memory and self-similarity. The predictability of long-short term memory neural network topologies (LSTM) is significantly higher when compared to the generalized regression neural architecture, set forth as our benchmark system. The latter failed to approximate global nonlinear hidden patterns regardless of the degree of contamination with noise, as they are based on Gaussian kernels suitable only for local approximation of non-stationary signals. Although the computational burden of the LSTM model is higher as opposed to brute force in nonlinear pattern recognition, eventually deep learning was found to be highly efficient in forecasting the inherent chaotic dynamics of cryptocurrency markets.

We propose an alternative protocol named Ari, which is a P2P optimization for blockchain systems.

To answer this question, we use individual-level brokerage data and study their behavior in stock trading around the time they engage in their first cryptocurrency trade. We find that when engaging in cryptocurrency trading investors simultaneously increase their risk-seeking behavior in stock trading as they increase their trading intensity and use of leverage. The increase in risk-seeking in stocks is particularly pronounced when volatility in cryptocurrency returns is low, suggesting that their overall behavior is driven by excitement-seeking.

Rooted from the nature of decentralization and anonymity of blockchain, the cryptocurrencies have, unfortunately, been leveraged for illicit activities by the criminals. The good news is that typical cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have to publicly publish their transactions, known as a graph, to retain their ultimate goal of trustless and decentralized transaction verification, which lends law enforcement a means to deanonymizing cryptocurrencies. At meantime, graph learning is an extremely powerful tool to extract the latent features of each vertex in a graph to fulfill various tasks, such as, classifying graph vertices. In this work, we discuss the promises and challenges of exploiting graph learning to deanonymizing cryptocurrencies, which can aid the cyberfighters to circumvent cryptocurrency-based illicit activities.","[Gaihre, Anil; Pandey, Santosh; Liu, Hang] Univ Massachusetts, Lowell, MA 01854 USA","University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Lowell","Gaihre, A (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Lowell, MA 01854 USA.","","Gaihre, Anil/AAB-5486-2020","","","","","","42","2","2","0","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2474-025X","","978-1-5386-7117-7","IEEE CONF COMM NETW","","","2019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3","Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BO1WR","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000502733200002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It is popular today among advocates of blockchain technology. While frequently employed as if it were a technical term, decentralization more reliably appears to operate as a rhetorical strategy that directs attention toward some aspects of a proposed social order and away from others. It is called for far more than it is theorized or consistently defined. This nonspecificity has served to draw diverse participants into common political and technological projects. Yet even the most apparently decentralized systems have shown the capacity to produce economically and structurally centralized outcomes. The rhetoric of decentralization thus obscures other aspects of the re-ordering it claims to describe. It steers attention from where concentrations of power are operating, deferring worthwhile debate about how such power should operate. For decentralization to be a reliable concept in formulating future social arrangements and related technologies, it should come with high standards of specificity. It also cannot substitute for anticipating centralization with appropriate mechanisms of accountability.","[Schneider, Nathan] Univ Colorado, Dept Media Studies, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder","Schneider, N (corresponding author), Coll Media Commun & Informat, 1511 Univ Ave, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.","nathan.schneider@colorado.edu","","SCHNEIDER, NATHAN/0000-0002-2745-0533","","","","","98","19","19","1","13","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1753-0350","1753-0369","","J CULT ECON-UK","J.

Design/methodology/approach A number of parametric (t-test, ANOVA, regression analysis with dummy variables) and non-parametric (Mann-Whitney U-test) tests confirm the presence of price patterns after overreactions: the next day price changes in both directions are bigger than after normal days. A trading robot approach is then used to establish whether these statistical anomalies can be exploited to generate profits. Findings The results suggest that a strategy based on counter-movements after overreactions is not profitable, whilst one based on inertia appears to be profitable but produces outcomes not statistically different from the random ones. Therefore, the overreactions detected in the cryptocurrency market do not give rise to exploitable profit opportunities (possibly because of transaction costs) and cannot be seen as evidence against the efficient market hypothesis (EMH).

My Consensus Protocol Circle of Trust overcomes the drawbacks of other consensus protocols such as PoW, PoS and DPos. Apart from this, Circle of Trust also has an architecture capable of scaling the transactions per second, as the network of miners grow, which no other blockchain on the market is capable of doing. This consensus protocol will be able to beat VISAs 56,000 transactions per second[3] while maintaining the sequence of blocks.

In this paper, we propose a lightweight blockchain called ZeroCalo. It constructs thousands of miner nodes into DHT (Distributed Hash Table) structure. Efficient message broadcast and key lookup are developed. With them, a consensus-based proof-of-work algorithm for distributed ledger is fulfilled. The evaluation shows that a transaction requires O(logN) of time and O(N) of bandwidth consumption. ZeroCalo consumes very little energy while providing good TPS.

Firstly, quantum teleportation technology is used for coin transaction, which prevents from the owner of the coin keeping the original coin data even after sending the coin to another. This was a main problem in a classical circuit and a blockchain was introduced to solve this issue. In qBitcoin, the double-spending problem never happens and its security is guaranteed theoretically by virtue of quantum information theory. Making a block is time consuming and the system of qBitcoin is based on a quantum chain, instead of blocks. Therefore, a payment can be completed much faster than Bitcoin. Moreover we employ quantum digital signature so that it naturally inherits properties of peer-to-peer (P2P) cash system as originally proposed in Bitcoin.","[Ikeda, Kazuki] Osaka Univ, Dept Phys, Suita, Osaka, Japan","Osaka University","Ikeda, K (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Dept Phys, Suita, Osaka, Japan.","kikeda@het.phys.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp","Ikeda, Kazuki/ABD-5604-2020","Ikeda, Kazuki/0000-0003-3821-2669","","","","","26","8","8","1","1","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","2194-5357","2194-5365","978-3-030-01174-1; 978-3-030-01173-4","ADV INTELL SYST","","","2019","858","","","","","","763","771","","10.1007/978-3-030-01174-1_58","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-01174-1_58","","","9","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BQ4OH","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000591565600058","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Rather than spending tokens for transaction fees, a token owner (known as a client) locks tokens to generate new tokens as a reward for the miner who includes the transaction in a block. This token-locking reward model eases congestion on the blockchain in the same manner as fees do in protocols like Bitcoin, but without forcing clients to sacrifice their tokens. This same design can be used to incentivize service providers. We show how a client can lock their tokens to generate new tokens for storage providers, and how this reward mechanism can help to facilitate an audit of the storage provider.","[Merrill, Paul; Austin, Thomas H.] 0Chain LLC, Res Grp, San Jose, CA USA; [Merrill, Paul; Austin, Thomas H.] San Jose State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Thakker, Jenil; Park, Younghee] San Jose State Univ, Dept Comp Engn, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Rietz, Justin] San Jose State Univ, Dept Econ, San Jose, CA 95192 USA","California State University System; San Jose State University; California State University System; San Jose State University; California State University System; San Jose State University","Merrill, P (corresponding author), 0Chain LLC, Res Grp, San Jose, CA USA.;Merrill, P (corresponding author), San Jose State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, San Jose, CA 95192 USA.","","","","","","","","24","3","3","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-1264-0","","","","2019","","","","","","","19","28","","10.1109/DAPPCON.2019.00013","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DAPPCON.2019.00013","","","10","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO1XR","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000502835000003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Hence, to arrive at intelligible conclusions, this paper carries out a systematic study of the peculiarities of the IoT environment including its security and performance requirements and progression in blockchain technologies. We have identified the gaps by mapping the security and performance benefits inferred by the blockchain technologies and some of the blockchain-based IoT applications against the IoT requirements.

Therefore, our construction is based on quantum-resistant cryptography, it is secure against the attack of a quantum adversary and ensures long-term safety. In addition, we design a decentralized blockchain structure with extended X.509 certificate, and it is secure for the single point of failure.","[An, Hyeongcheol; Kim, Kwangjo] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol KAIST, Grad Sch Informat Secur, Daejeon, South Korea; [Choi, Rakyong; Kim, Kwangjo] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol KAIST, Sch Comp, Daejeon, South Korea","Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST)","Kim, K (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol KAIST, Grad Sch Informat Secur, Daejeon, South Korea.;Kim, K (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol KAIST, Sch Comp, Daejeon, South Korea.","anh1026@kaist.ac.kr; thepride@kaist.ac.kr; kkj@kaist.ac.kr","","","Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT) [2017-0-00555]","Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT)(Institute for Information & Communication Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP), Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2017-0-00555, Towards Provable-secure Multi-party Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol based on Lattices in a Quantum World).","","16","1","1","2","6","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-17982-3; 978-3-030-17981-6","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2019","11402","","","","","","229","240","","10.1007/978-3-030-17982-3_18","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-17982-3_18","","","12","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Mathematics","BS7SQ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000766408800018","View Full Record in Web of Science"

There is no such authority which will provide them feasibility information. So, investors can be helped by providing them feasibility information about locations for cryptocurrency investment around the world. This paper aims to provide the aforementioned information to the investors. The proposed methodology is based on Topic modeling along with public opinion mining about cryptocurrencies, blockchain network, bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum. The crawled data for other cryptocurrencies are much insufficient, so that are excluded from the study. In the proposed methodology, the top locations where cryptocurrency is widely used are identified, then in that particular locations' users concerns along with their sentiment analyses are investigated. Top locations are identified such as Australia, Denmark, Netherlands, and the USA etc. Almost 83.7% tweets of Sweden show positive sentiment for cryptocurrency investment which ranks as the highest having friendly environment for cryptocurrency investment. Similarly, the UK shows the least positive perception of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology usage. Some of the noteworthy terms found are legitimacy, authorization rules, volatility, profit, investment, and fluctuations. Which describe the users' concerns/ interests' about cryptocurrency. Investors can focus on all these areas during business.

The main goal of MFA is to set up extra layer of safeguard while seeking access to a targets such as physical location, computing device, network or database. MFA security scheme requires more than one method for the validation from commutative family of credentials to verify the user for a transaction. MFA can reduce the risk of using single level password authentication by introducing additional factors of authentication. MFA can prevent hackers from gaining access to a particular account even if the password is compromised. The superfluous layer of security introduced by MFA offers additional security to a user. MFA is implemented by using time-based one-time password (TOTP) technique. For logging to any entity with MFA enabled, the user first needs username and password, as a second factor, the user then needs the MFA token to virtually generate a TOTP. It is found that MFA can provide a better means of secured transaction of CR.","[Abu Taher, Kazi; Nahar, Tahmin] Bangladesh Univ Profess, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Hossain, Syed Akhter] Daffodil Int Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Dhaka, Bangladesh","Daffodil International University","Abu Taher, K (corresponding author), Bangladesh Univ Profess, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Dhaka, Bangladesh.","kataher@bup.edu.bd; tahmincse9@yahoo.com; aktarhossain@daffidilvarsity.edu.bd","","Taher, Kazi Abu/0000-0003-2179-4607","","","","","16","5","5","0","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-8012-4","","","","2019","","","","","","","308","312","","","","","","5","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Robotics","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Robotics","BM3RP","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000462598800060","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this paper, we study three cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin, by analysing the state of their UTXO sets, that is, the status of their sets of spendable coins. These three cryptocurrencies are the top-3 UTXO-based cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Our analysis shows that the usage of each cryptocurrency presents some differences, and led to different results. Furthermore, it also points out that the management of the transactions has not always been performed efficiently and therefore, the current state of the UTXO sets is far from ideal.","[Perez-Sola, C.; Delgado-Segura, S.; Navarro-Arribas, G.; Herrera-Joancomarti, J.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Informat & Commun Engn, Barcelona, Spain; [Perez-Sola, C.; Delgado-Segura, S.; Navarro-Arribas, G.; Herrera-Joancomarti, J.] CYBERCAT, Ctr Recerca Ciberseguretat Catalunya, Tarragona, Spain; [Perez-Sola, C.] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Comp Engn & Math, Tarragona, Spain","Autonomous University of Barcelona; Universitat Rovira i Virgili","Herrera-Joancomarti, J (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Informat & Commun Engn, Barcelona, Spain.;Herrera-Joancomarti, J (corresponding author), CYBERCAT, Ctr Recerca Ciberseguretat Catalunya, Tarragona, Spain.","jordi.herrera@uab.cat","Navarro-Arribas, Guillermo/AFP-6074-2022; Pérez-Solà, Cristina/AAC-6445-2019; Herrera-Joancomarti, Jordi/B-8627-2009","Navarro-Arribas, Guillermo/0000-0003-3535-942X; Pérez-Solà, Cristina/0000-0001-7534-1326; Herrera-Joancomarti, Jordi/0000-0002-4935-4681","Spanish ministry [TIN2014-55243-P]; Catalan Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR) [2014SGR-691]; Marti-Franques postdoctoral program from Universitat Rovira i Virgili","Spanish ministry(Spanish Government); Catalan Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR)(Agencia de Gestio D'Ajuts Universitaris de Recerca Agaur (AGAUR)); Marti-Franques postdoctoral program from Universitat Rovira i Virgili","This work is partially supported by the Spanish ministry under grant no.

Blockchain technology often causes controversies surrounding its application potential and business ramifications. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer network of information technology that keeps records of digital asset transactions using distributed ledgers that are free from control by intermediaries such as banks and governments. Thus, it can mitigate risks associated with intermediaries' interventions, including hacking, compromised privacy, vulnerability to political turmoil, costly compliance with government rules and regulation, instability of financial institutions, and contractual disputes. This article unlocks the mystique of blockchain technology and discusses ways to leverage blockchain technology to enhance supply chain resilience in times of increased risks and uncertainty.

According to Homeland Security statistics, 1.5 million ransomware attacks have occurred per year since 2016. Cybercriminals often use creative methods to inject their malware into the target machines and use sophisticated cryptographic techniques to hold hostage victims' files and programs unless a certain amount of equivalent Bitcoin is paid. The return to the cybercriminals is so high (estimated $1 billion in 2019) without any cost because of the advanced anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin [1]. Given this context, this study first discusses the current state of ransomware, detection, and prevention systems. Second, we propose a global ransomware center to better manage our concerted efforts against cybercriminals.

The divisibility of a blockchain cryptocurrency to even fractions of a cent, caused microtransactions to become feasible to formerly non-existent denominations. These microtransactions have spurred the development of novel ways of monetizing online resources and hold the potential to aid in alleviation of poverty. The paper conducts a feasibility study on Stellar as a blockchain-based micropayment system. It highlights the limitations in Stellar that impedes its progress and utilizes a characterization model for micropayment systems to evaluate the efficacy of the Stellar platform. The paper conducts a comparison with the micropayment solutions from Bitcoin, Ethereum and PayPal.

The best model or superior set of models is then chosen by backtesting VaR and ES as well as using a Model Confidence Set (MCS) procedure for their loss functions. The results imply that using standard GARCH models may yield incorrect VaR and ES predictions, and hence result in ineffective risk-management, portfolio optimisation, pricing of derivative securities etc. These could be improved by using instead the model specifications allowing for asymmetries and regime switching suggested by our analysis, from which both investors and regulators can benefit.","[Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] Brunel Univ London, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Zekokh, Timur] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia","Brunel University; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics)","Caporale, GM (corresponding author), Brunel Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, London UB8 3PH, England.","Guglielmo-Maria.Caporale@brunel.ac.uk","","Zekokh, Timur/0000-0001-8447-012X; Caporale, Guglielmo Maria/0000-0002-0144-4135","Russian Academic Excellence Project '5-100'","Russian Academic Excellence Project '5-100'(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian FederationProject 5-100, Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation)","The second-named author gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Russian Academic Excellence Project '5-100'.","","55","61","61","6","29","ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","AMSTERDAM","PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0275-5319","1878-3384","","RES INT BUS FINANC","Res.

While there have been some previous studies, most of them have focused exclusively on the behavior of Bitcoin. In this paper, we propose the usage of common machine learning tools and available social media data for predicting the price movement of the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin cryptocurrency market movements. We compare the utilization of neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) while using elements from Twitter and market data as input features.

As of today, there are many different implementations of cryptocurrencies working over a blockchain, with different approaches and philosophies. However, many of them share one common feature: they require proof-of-work to support the generation of blocks (mining) and, eventually, the generation of money. This proof-of-work scheme often consists in the resolution of a cryptography problem, most commonly breaking a hash value, which can only be achieved through brute-force. The main drawback of proof-of-work is that it requires ridiculously large amounts of energy which do not have any useful outcome beyond supporting the currency. In this paper, we present a theoretical proposal that introduces a proof-of-useful-work scheme to support a cryptocurrency running over a blockchain, which we named Coin.AI. In this system, the mining scheme requires training deep learning models, and a block is only mined when the performance of such model exceeds a threshold. The distributed system allows for nodes to verify the models delivered by miners in an easy way (certainly much more efficiently than the mining process itself), determining when a block is to be generated. Additionally, this paper presents a proof-of-storage scheme for rewarding users that provide storage for the deep learning models, as well as a theoretical dissertation on how the mechanics of the system could be articulated with the ultimate goal of democratizing access to artificial intelligence.","[Baldominos, Alejandro; Saez, Yago] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Comp Sci, Madrid 28911, Spain","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid","Baldominos, A (corresponding author), Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Comp Sci, Madrid 28911, Spain.","abaldomi@inf.uc3m.es","Saez, Yago/X-8782-2019; Saez, Yago/B-9763-2013; Baldominos, Alejandro/Z-3709-2019","Saez, Yago/0000-0002-0998-2907; Baldominos, Alejandro/0000-0002-8906-7572","","","","","48","26","29","4","19","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1099-4300","","ENTROPY-SWITZ","Entropy","AUG","2019","21","8","","","","","","","723","10.3390/e21080723","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e21080723","","","17","Physics, Multidisciplinary","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Physics","IU6YX","33267437","gold, Green Published, Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000483732700078","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this study, we intend to compare the transaction graph of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, and Z-Cash, with respect to the dynamics of their transaction graphs over time, and discuss their properties. In particular, we observed that the growth rate of the nodes and edges of the transaction graphs, and the density of these graphs, are closely related to the price of these currencies. We also found that the transaction graph of these currencies is non-assortative, i.e. addresses do not tend for transact with a particular type of addresses of higher or lower degree, and the degree sequence of their transaction graph follows the power law distribution.","[Motamed, Amir Pasha; Bahrak, Behnam] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, North Kargar St, Tehran, Iran","University of Tehran","Bahrak, B (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, North Kargar St, Tehran, Iran.","bahrak@ut.ac.ir","","","","","","","25","14","15","0","1","SPRINGERNATURE","LONDON","CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND","","2364-8228","","APPL NETW SCI","Appl.

With the increasing number of public blockchains, the evaluation of public blockchains becomes meaningful. This paper aims to make a comprehensive evaluation of public blockchains from multiple dimensions. Three first-level indicators and eleven second-level indicators are designed to evaluate the public blockchains. The technique for order preferences by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is used to rank public blockchains. The entropy method is used to calculate the weights of different indicators objectively. Since Bitcoin has an absolute advantage, a let-the-first-out (LFO) strategy is proposed to reduce the criteria of the positive ideal solution and make a more reasonable evaluation. The evaluation indicators and the ranking results of public blockchains can provide related researchers and managers with references and support their decisions. The three first-level indicators are technology, recognition, and activity. Their weights are 16.80%, 59.00%, and 24.20% respectively. The evaluation result shows that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and EOS are ranked in the top three public blockchains. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, being a technology that could decrease significance many of today's large global corporations, institutions and power structures which have keen interest in preserving established hierarchies, its potential could well remain unexploited. This paper aims to introduce and present the concept of blockchain and its current applications in logistics and supply networks.

Owing to this, one serious rising concern is that the energy waste not only dilutes the value of the blockchain but also hinders its further application. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain design that fully recycles the energy required for facilitating and maintaining it, which is re-invested to the computation of deep learning. We realize this by proposing Proof-of-Deep-Learning (PoDL) such that a valid proof for a new block can be generated if and only if a proper deep learning model is produced. We present a proof-of-concept design of PoDL that is compatible with the majority of the cryptocurrencies that are based on hash-based PoW mechanisms. Our benchmark and simulation results show that the proposed design is feasible for various popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin.","[Chenli, Changhao; Li, Boyang; Shi, Yiyu; Jung, Taeho] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","University of Notre Dame","Chenli, C (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.","cchenli@nd.edu; Boyang.Li.258@nd.edu; yshi4@nd.edu; tjung@nd.edu","","","","","","","10","22","25","3","13","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-1328-9","","","","2019","","","","","","","19","23","","","","","","5","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO0IT","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000491257000010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In particular, it compares and contrasts Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus mechanisms, assessing not just how they operate in a technical sense but also (and most important) the political, economic and social dimensions of these different blockchain governance strategies. This comparison highlights efforts by blockchain communities to redefine or push the bounds of democracy, as well as the challenges they have faced in their efforts to create digital democracies that do not reproduce the same economic and social inequalities present in traditional democratic systems.","[Tozzi, Christopher] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Troy, NY 12181 USA","Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute","Tozzi, C (corresponding author), Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Troy, NY 12181 USA.","tozzic@rpi.edu","","","","","","","16","4","4","1","5","UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, SERVICIO PUBLICACIONES","MADRID","CIUDAD UNIV, OBISPO TREJO 3, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN","1549-2230","","","TEKNOKULT REV CULT D","Teknokult.

Dynamic pricing throughout the smart grid will require frequent transfer of energy consumption data from the customers to the ISOs. Privacy and security issues related to transferring this data are widely studied. However, typical frameworks rely on a trusted third party, such as the ISO or a load aggregator, that would then have access to all of the consumer data. This paper proposes a Bitcoin-like decentralized model as a solution for secure information transfer within the smart grid, eliminating the presence of a centralized data aggregator or other third party operator. Each smart meter participates as an equal peer in the proposed peer-to-peer network, and elements of authentication, confidentiality and data verification are developed similar to the existing Bitcoin framework. The contribution of this paper is the proposed framework for the smart grid which cryptographically secures the transfer of energy consumption data while ensuring privacy.","[Upreti, Angela] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Cardell, Judith B.; Thiebaut, Dominique] Smith Coll, Northampton, MA 01063 USA","University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Smith College","Upreti, A (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.","aupreti@cs.umass.edu; jcardell@smith.edu; dthiebaut@smith.edu","","","Department of Energy [DE-OE0000843]","Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This material is partially based upon work supported by the Department of Energy under Award Number DE-OE0000843.","","20","0","0","0","1","HICSS","Honolulu","Dept IT Mgmt, Shidler College of Business, Univ Hawaii at Manoa 2404 Maile Way D307, Honolulu, Hawaii, UNITED STATES","","","978-0-9981331-2-6","","","","2019","","","","","","","3504","3513","","","","","","10","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BQ9KL","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000625294903068","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This cash mostly stay in people's pockets and travels back to people's home country. There are ways that LFC can be brought back into the economy such as souvenir shopping at the airports, donations to a charity wending machine or throwing into fountains to wish. However, these means of utilization have various limitations associated with them. Hence, there is a need for a transparent and a more convenient method to spend the LFC. In this work, we implement a system that solves the LFC problem by converting it into a cryptocurrency. The process of conversion requires depositing the LFC at a kiosk. The users can then use an android application to receive the cryptocurrency which they deposit in the foreign country. The amount of cryptocurrency bought by current rate appears in the users' e-wallet. The kiosk backend handles the currency and storage of critical transactions in a blockchain. The proposed system gives a fairly simple solution for a long lasting problem that is only possible because of the blockchain technology.","[Saldamli, Gokay; Babji, Shreyas; Grubic, Miroslav; Shekar, Nischala Raja; Satyanarayana, Chaitra] San Jose State Univ, Dept Comp Engn, San Jose, CA 95192 USA","California State University System; San Jose State University","Saldamli, G (corresponding author), San Jose State Univ, Dept Comp Engn, San Jose, CA 95192 USA.","","","","","","","","14","0","0","1","5","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-0722-6","","","","2019","","","","","","","290","293","","","","","","4","Computer Science, Software Engineering; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BO0PK","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000492873000042","View Full Record in Web of Science"

To transfer funds from one user to another, the owner of the money signs a new transaction that transfers the funds to the new recipient. This makes secret keys a highly attractive target for attacks, and has lead to prominent examples where millions of dollars worth in cryptocurrency have been stolen. To protect against these attacks, a widely used approach are so-called hot/cold wallets. In a hot/cold wallet system, the hot wallet is permanently connected to the network, while the cold wallet stores the secret key and is kept without network connection. In this work, we propose the first comprehensive security model for hot/cold wallets and develop wallet schemes that are provable secure within these models. At the technical level our main contribution is to provide a new provably secure ECDSA-based hot/cold wallet scheme that can be integrated into legacy cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Our construction and security analysis uses a modular approach, where we show how to generically build secure hot/cold wallets from signature schemes that exhibit a rerandomizing property of the keys.","[Das, Poulami; Faust, Sebastian] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany; [Loss, Julian] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany; [Loss, Julian] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Technical University of Darmstadt; Ruhr University Bochum; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park","Das, P (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany.","poulami.das@crisp-da.de; sebastian.faust@cs.tu-darmstadt.de; julian.loss@ruhr-uni-bochum.de","","","DFG [CRC 1119 CROSSING]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) iBlockchain project; ERC Project ERCC [FP7/615074]; German Federal Ministery of Education and Research; Hessen State Ministry for Higher Education, Research and the Arts within the National Research Center for Applied Cybersecurity (CRISP)","DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) iBlockchain project(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); ERC Project ERCC; German Federal Ministery of Education and Research; Hessen State Ministry for Higher Education, Research and the Arts within the National Research Center for Applied Cybersecurity (CRISP)","This work was partly supported by the DFG CRC 1119 CROSSING (project S7), the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) iBlockchain project, and the ERC Project ERCC (FP7/615074).

Although GitHub currently hosts more than six thousand active Blockchain software (BCS) projects, few software engineering researchers have investigated these projects and their contributors. Although the number of BCS projects is growing rapidly, the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers remain a puzzle. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to understand the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers and analyze the differences between BCS and non-BCS development. On this goal, we sent an online survey to 1,604 active BCS developers identified by mining the GitHub repositories of 145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses that met our criteria for analysis. The results suggest that the majority of the BCS developers are experienced in non-BCS development and are primarily motivated by the ideology of creating a decentralized financial system. Although most of the BCS projects are Open Source Software (OSS) projects by nature, more than 93% of our respondents found BCS development somewhat different from a non-BCS development as BCS projects have higher emphasis on security and reliability than most of the non-BCS projects. Other differences include: higher costs of defects, decentralized and hostile environment, technological complexity, and difficulty in upgrading the software after release. These differences were also the primary sources of challenges to them. Software development tools that are tuned for non-BCS development are inadequate for BCS and the ecosystem needs an array of new or improved tools, such as: customized IDE for BCS development tasks, debuggers for smart-contracts, testing support, easily deployable simulators, and BCS domain specific design notations.","[Bosu, Amiangshu] Wayne State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Iqbal, Anindya; Shahriyar, Rifat; Chakraborty, Partha] Bangladesh Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Dhaka, Bangladesh","Wayne State University; Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET)","Bosu, A (corresponding author), Wayne State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.","amiangshu.bosu@wayne.edu; anindya@cse.buet.ac.bd; rifat@cse.buet.ac.bd; shuvopartho@gmail.com","Bosu, Amiangshu/AAB-1259-2020","Bosu, Amiangshu/0000-0002-3178-6232","","","","","92","23","24","4","45","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1382-3256","1573-7616","","EMPIR SOFTW ENG","Empir.

In such an environment, providing a transparent and secure voting system is a key to gain back the trust of the citizens. The traditional paper-based or digital voting system has several problems encountered as it is managed by a single organization having fully control of the system and database. This organization can tamper with the database, and can easily eliminate the traces. Furthermore, these systems have also encountered problems like security of people, security and privacy of data, time consumption, and potential system attacks. In modern world it is possible to build a transparent voting system to address these security credentials of current voting systems. The technology which paves the ground for this new generation voting system is called Blockchain. Blockchain is a distributed, transparent and unchangeable database of continually growing data records that ensures the truth of data by providing public inspection of votes cast for a candidate in a secure, anonymous and verifiable way. Core tent of this voting system is to remove all need for trust and place strong emphasis on open End to End verification of the process and votes. The implementation of proposed system will result to higher voter turnout as it has substantial benefits and brings more easing to cast a vote. The implementation of proposed system in Afghanistan may also encounter some challenges such as cyber security hacks, digital devices and internet access requirement, and low literacy rate. To avoid these obstacles the government can make some alternate arrangements to make it more secure and reliable. This research focused on effectiveness and challenges of this new generation voting system in Afghanistan.","[Hedayati, Mohammad Hadi; Baktash, Jawid Ahmad; Mohmand, Omer Salim] Kabul Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Kabul, Afghanistan","","Hedayati, MH (corresponding author), Kabul Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Kabul, Afghanistan.","hdhedayati@gmail.com; jawid.baktash@yahoo.com; omersalim786@gmail.com","","","","","","","16","1","1","0","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-93-80544-34-2","","","","2019","","","","","","","435","438","","","","","","4","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP3QH","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000548605000088","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It removes the reliance on a third-party intermediary, while securing information exchange and creating shared truth via transaction records that are hard to tamper with. The successful operation of DLT stems largely from two computer science technologies: consensus mechanisms and information security protocols. Consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Raft, ensure that the DLT network collectively agrees on contents stored in the ledger. Information security protocols, such as encryption and hashing, protect data integrity and safeguard data against unauthorized access. The most popular incarnation of DLT has been used in cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, through public blockchains, which requires the application of more robust consensus protocols across the entire network. An example is PoW, which has been employed by Bitcoin, but which is also highly energy inefficient. Other forms of DLT include consortium and private blockchains where networks are configured within federated entities or a single organization, in which case less energy intensive consensus protocols (such as Raft) would suffice. This chapter surveys existing consensus mechanisms and information security technologies used in DLT.","[Zhang, Peng] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biomed Informat, Nashville, TN 37212 USA; [Schmidt, Douglas C.; White, Jules; Dubey, Abhishek] Vanderbilt Univ, Inst Software Integrated Syst, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA","Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University","Zhang, P (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biomed Informat, Nashville, TN 37212 USA.","","","Dubey, Abhishek/0000-0002-0168-4948","","","","","36","7","7","2","7","ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC","SAN DIEGO","525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","0065-2458","","978-0-12-817189-9","ADV COMPUT","Adv.

As such, the emergence of this asset into global markets requires tax regulators to be particularly nimble with respect to regulation. This article reviews the rapidly shifting regulatory landscape of digital currency by comparing its definition, for tax purposes, as an intangible asset under Australian and US tax law. The article finds that reactive regulatory responses triggered a piecemeal inclusion of digital currencies into a pre-existing taxation framework, causing unintended regulatory consequences. The article concludes that the regulation of digital currency needs to be increasingly proactive, as the placement of new market products under an existing definitional framework leads to inconsistencies in regulatory application. While tax administration will not drive stabilisation of the digital marketplace, tax administrators might consider that regulation of digital currency, as a new hybrid intangible asset in a global marketplace, may provide an opportunity to consider forward-thinking global harmonisation.","[Powell, Karen; Hope, Monica] Deakin Univ, Sch Law, Geelong, Vic, Australia","Deakin University","Powell, K (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Sch Law, Geelong, Vic, Australia.","k.powell@deakin.edu.au; m.hope@deakin.edu.au","","Powell, K.E./0000-0002-9006-0466","","","","","50","0","0","0","7","UNIV NEW SOUTH WALES, FAC LAW","KENSINGTON","PO BOX 1, KENSINGTON, NSW 2033, AUSTRALIA","1448-2398","","","EJOURNAL TAX RES","EJournal Tax Res.","","2019","16","3","","","","","594","619","","","","","","26","Law","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Government & Law","HO6FO","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000461025200009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This differs from the classical approach in which the expected rate of price change and variance are assumed to be independent. The microeconomic and stochastic analysis leads to the conclusion that a particular measure of the marginal volatility has a minimum shortly before the expected log-price has an extremum. The maximum of the volatility occurs when prices are likely to change most rapidly, and the supply/demand imbalance is greatest. The great bubble and collapse of Bitcoin's price serves as a test of this analysis. The volatility reached a minimum shortly prior to the peak of Bitcoin's price in December 2018. The model is further developed under the assumption that supply and demand depend on the fundamental value of the asset. Thus the paper is a key step in understanding the issue of whether volatility highs and lows can forecast trading price tops and bottoms. The methodology can be extended beyond log-normal returns and is further compared with an empirical study of 40 sharp market boom/bust events studied by Sornette et. al. (2017).

These blockchains are being used in media, health, finance, transportation and government with little understanding, acknowledgment of the risk and no known plans for mitigation and migration to safer public-key cryptography. The second aim is to evaluate ECDSA against the threat of Quantum Computing and propose the most practical National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Post-Quantum Cryptography candidate algorithm lattice-based cryptography countermeasure that can be implemented near-term and provide a basis for a coordinated industry-wide lattice-based public-key implementation. Commercial quantum computing research and development is rapid and unpredictable, and it is difficult to predict the arrival of fault-tolerant quantum computing. The current state of covert and classified quantum computing research and advancement is unknown and therefore, it would be a significant risk to blockchain and Internet technologies to delay or wait for the publication of draft standards. Since there are many hurdles Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) must overcome for standardisation, coordinated large-scale testing and evaluation should commence promptly.","[Campbell, Robert E., Sr.] Capitol Technol Univ, Laurel, MD 20708 USA","","Campbell, RE (corresponding author), Capitol Technol Univ, Laurel, MD 20708 USA.","rc@medcybersecurity.com","","","","","","","11","3","3","4","4","BRITISH BLOCKCHAIN ASSOC","LONDON","KEMP HOUSE 152-160 CITY RD, LONDON, EC1V 2NX, ENGLAND","","2516-3957","","J BRIT BLOCKCHAIN AS","J.

To this end, we concentrate on the top 9 cryptocurrencies by virtue of market capitalization and one market factor - based on 45 additional digital currencies - capturing the co-movements in the cryptocurrency market. The period of study spans between August 7, 2015 and May 31, 2018. We find that the dynamic total connectedness across several cryptocurrencies exhibits large dynamic variability ranging between 25% and 75%. In particular, periods of high (low) market uncertainty correspond to strong (weak) connectedness. We show that these results could be explained on the basis of increased market uncertainty that is associated with periods of highly volatile prices. In addition, despite the fact that Bitcoin still influences the cryptocurrency market substantially, we note that, recently, Ethereum has become the number one net transmitting cryptocurrency. We further note that the market gradually becomes more complex considering our connectedness approach and that this might be attributed to the unique characteristics and possibilities inherent in the technology of each cryptocurrency. A simplified application concentrating on bivariate portfolios is indicative of potential hedging opportunities using dynamic hedge ratios and dynamic portfolio weights. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Bitcoin uses short-lived immutable data structures called UTXOs for data manipulation. Ethereum, on the other hand uses, long-lived mutable data structures called accounts. UTXOs are easier to handle, less error prone and scale better because the only operation we can do with them is to create or destroy (i.e., spend) them. The code inside a UTXO is executed only once, when it is spent. Additionally, this code refers to only local context (i.e., it is stateless). In Ethereum's account based system, there is a shared global context which each account can access and modify, thereby causing side affects. However, the benefit of persistent storage offered by accounts makes up for these drawbacks. In this work, we describe how to emulate persistent storage in UTXO based systems using a technique called transaction trees. This allows us to emulate the functionality of account-based systems such as Ethereum without the overhead of accounts. We demonstrate this via several examples which include contracts for a Rock-Paper-Scissors game, crowdfunding and an initial coin offering (ICO). The contracts are created in a UTXO based smart contract platform called Ergo that supports transaction trees.","[Chepurnoy, Alexander; Saxena, Amitabh] Ergo Platform, Bern, Switzerland","","Saxena, A (corresponding author), Ergo Platform, Bern, Switzerland.","kushti@protonmail.ch; amitabh123@protonmail.ch","","","","","","","14","2","2","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-31500-9; 978-3-030-31499-6","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2019","11737","","","","","","244","254","","10.1007/978-3-030-31500-9_16","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-31500-9_16","","","11","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BP5UZ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000558296200016","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It is implemented based on a consensus algorithm called Proof-of-Work (PoW) which confirms transactions and produces new blocks to the chain. With PoW, miners compete against each other to complete transactions on the network and get rewarded. In this paper, we simulate bitcoin, which is a well-known example of a Blockchain, to perform tasks such as network and blockchain simulation, and being the subject of a double spending attacks using a framework established by Arthur Gervais. This framework is utilized to evaluate the double-spending behavior of bitcoin based on an average attacker's hashrate as a proxy measure of the security of processed transactions. This stimulation runs in a discrete-event network simulator called NS-3. The result of this simulation shows that an increase in attacker's hashrate is parallel with an increase in number of double-spending attacks, an increase in attacker's income and the number of stale blocks posing a threat to transaction's security. Stale blocks increase the advantage of attacker in the double spending attacks in the network.","[Suliyanti, Widya Nita; Sari, Riri Fitri] Univ Indonesia, Dept Elect Engn, Depok, Indonesia","University of Indonesia","Suliyanti, WN (corresponding author), Univ Indonesia, Dept Elect Engn, Depok, Indonesia.","widya.nita@ui.ac.id; riri@ui.ac.id","","","Ministry of Research and Higher Education of Republic of Indonesia [NKB-1743/UN2.R3.1/HKP.05.00/2019]","Ministry of Research and Higher Education of Republic of Indonesia","We thank Ministry of Research and Higher Education of Republic of Indonesia for financial support for this research under the PTUPT Grant number NKB-1743/UN2.R3.1/HKP.05.00/2019.","","19","3","4","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2162-1233","","978-1-7281-0893-3","I C INF COMM TECH CO","","","2019","","","","","","","169","174","","","","","","6","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering","BO7KM","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000524690200038","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, the security and consistency of such system derive from the wide replication of transaction data and expensive distributed consensus mechanism, which makes current cryptocurrencies suffer great scalability gap from meeting commercial demand. To date, several solutions have been proposed to solve the scalability bottleneck of blockchain systems such as Bitcoin-NG, sharding mechanism and off-chain payment network. The off-chain payment network is one of the most promising approaches since it could significantly extend the throughput of the system and provide cheap instant micro-payment. In this work, we introduce Gnocchi, a multiplexed off-channel payment channel scheme that offers a novel method to construct an off-channel payment system to allow multi-party payment in one channel. We formally model our payment network and analyze network connectivity of our scheme to show that this newly proposed scheme significantly reduces the routing cost and transfer fee for cross-channel payment in contrast to existing off-chain payment scheme such as Lightning Network. This improves the efficiency of off-chain payment system further. We introduce transaction supervisor in a channel while maintaining the decentralization feature of the system by elaborately designing a fraud proof contract to restrain any adversary in the channel.","[Pan, Chen; Tang, Shuyang; Ge, Zhonghui; Liu, Zhiqiang; Long, Yu; Liu, Zhen; Gu, Dawu] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Shanghai Jiao Tong University","Tang, SY; Liu, ZQ; Long, Y; Liu, Z; Gu, DW (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.","htftsy@sjtu.edu.cn; ilu_zq@sjtu.edu.cn; longyu@sjtu.edu.cn; liuzhen@sjtu.edu.cn; dwgu@sjtu.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61672347]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61672347).","","27","1","1","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-36938-5; 978-3-030-36937-8","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2019","11928","","","","","","488","503","","10.1007/978-3-030-36938-5_30","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-36938-5_30","","","16","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Mathematics","BS4ZQ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000724601900030","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It is the consensus protocol that ensures a common and unambiguous update of transactions by creating blocks of transactions for which integrity, veracity, and consistency are guaranteed through geographically distributed nodes. Bitcoin, the first popular blockchain concept, introduced the Proof of Work consensus based on work validation, and has been extended to thousands of participants. Despite its success and its large use in other crypto-currencies, Proof of Work's disadvantages are a high latency, a low transaction rate, and a high energy expenditure, making it a less-than-perfect choice for many applications. In addition the validation of transactions is not carried out with a definite temporality. For Bitcoin, it takes on average 10 minutes to create a block. However, for certain use cases such as auctions or the exchange of energy, there is a need for this temporality. The purpose of this article is to propose a new type of consensus that is faster, less energy-consuming and that can be synchronized with a time reference.

We illustrate this point with a brief case study of Chelan County, Washington-where an influx of crypto mining over the past five years has stirred community debate. We collected more than 100 newspaper articles, public comments, and public meeting recordings to identify the cautions, hesitations, and criticisms that have caused local regulators to take a precautionary approach. We highlight five key points of the debate that may be of interest to energy social scientists: (1) impacts on the local energy supply and prices, (2) unclear socioeconomic benefits to the county, (3) the illegitimacy of cryptocurrency, (4) environmental considerations, and (5) a disconnect with local legacy industries and community economic identity.

One solution to protect users is splitting the money between super-wallet and sub-wallet. The user stores a large amount of money on her super-wallet and keeps it safe; she refills the sub-wallet when she needs while using the sub-wallet for her daily purchases. In this paper, we propose a new scheme to create sub-wallet that we call deterministic sub-wallet. In this scheme, the seed of the sub-wallet keys is derived from the super-wallet master seed, and therefore the super-wallet can build many sub-wallet addresses and refill them in a single blockchain transaction. Compared to existing approaches, our mechanism is cheaper, real-time, more secure against man-in-the-middle attack and easier for backup and recovery. We implement a proof-of-concept on a hardware wallet and evaluate its performance. In addition, we analyze the attacks and defenses of this design to demonstrate that our proposed method has a higher level of security than existing models.","[Rezaeighaleh, Hossein; Zou, Cliff C.] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Comp Sci, Orlando, FL 32816 USA","State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida","Rezaeighaleh, H (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Dept Comp Sci, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.","rezaei@knights.ucf.edu; czou@cs.ucf.edu","","","National Science Foundation [DGE-1723587]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under grant DGE-1723587.","","13","3","3","1","5","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-4693-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","419","424","","10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00064","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00064","","","6","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO8PX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000528931600055","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This combination becomes apparent in their volatility, which is driven only by demand-side factors. In particular, cryptocurrencies represent an extreme case of the excess volatility puzzle, with asset prices moving more than the fundamentals. We explore the effects of market capitalization on the dynamics of cryptocurrencies within both returns and volatility networks and show that these cryptocurrencies exhibit scaling properties in volatility with respect to market capitalization. The dependency network suggests that currencies with a larger market share have a larger presence in the dominant eigenspectrum, and they exert more influence in the comovement network. In these regards, we find parallels between the dynamics of cryptocurrencies and those of more traditional asset classes. Our findings have implications for both researchers and practitioners in terms of modeling and analyzing the collective behavior of financial assets.","[Pogudin, Andrey; Di Matteo, Tiziana] Kings Coll London, Dept Math, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Chakrabati, Anindya] Indian Inst Management, Econ Area, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India; [Di Matteo, Tiziana] Complex Sci Hub Vienna, Josefstaedter Str 39, A-1080 Vienna, Austria","University of London; King's College London; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad","Pogudin, A (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Dept Math, London WC2R 2LS, England.","andrey.pogudin@kcl.ac.uk; anindyac@iima.ac.in; tiziana.di_matteo@kcl.ac.uk","DiMatteo, Tiziana/AGZ-7196-2022","","Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad RP grant; Department of Mathematics, King's College London","Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad RP grant; Department of Mathematics, King's College London","A.

In the Bitcoin payment system, all the activities of users are stored on the public blockchain. However, with the increase of users and the number of transactions, the traditional blockchain based system cannot provide fast processing due to the limited throughput of the blockchain. To solve these problems, an off-chain transaction has been proposed. The most famous method of building the off-chain transaction is a micropayment channel in the Bitcoin payment system. Users create a payment channel among them and all most transactions that occur in the payment channel are stored on the off-chain, except for some transactions. In this paper, we propose an enhanced blockchain-based access control system for reducing the cost of transactions. A grantor and a grantee create the micropayment channel between them. All the activities of them are stored as the off-chain transaction and when they want to close the channel, the last committed off-chain transaction is broadcasted to the blockchain network. As a result, the cost of the transaction can be reduced by reducing the number of transactions stored in the on-chain.","[Noh, Siwan] Pukyong Natl Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Informat Secur, Busan, South Korea; [Park, Youngho; Rhee, Kyung-Hyune] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept IT Convergence & Applicat Engn, Busan, South Korea","Pukyong National University; Pukyong National University","Rhee, KH (corresponding author), Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept IT Convergence & Applicat Engn, Busan, South Korea.","nosiwan@pukyong.ac.kr; pyhoya@pknu.ac.kr; khrhee@pknu.ac.kr","","","Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT) [2017-0-00156]; MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program [IITP-2017-2015-0-00403]","Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT); MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program","This work was supported by Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2017-0-00156, The Development of a Secure Framework and Evaluation Method for Blockchain) and partially supported by the MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program (IITP-2017-2015-0-00403) supervised by the IITP (Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion).","","8","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD","SINGAPORE","152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE","1876-1100","1876-1119","978-981-13-1328-8; 978-981-13-1327-1","LECT NOTES ELECTR EN","","","2019","518","","","","","","687","692","","10.1007/978-981-13-1328-8_88","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-1328-8_88","","","6","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT3NL","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000821121100088","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We first provide evidence that all conditional variances are significantly affected by both previous squared errors and past conditional volatility. It is also shown that both methodologies indicate that cryptocurrency investors pay the most attention to news relating to Neo and the least attention to news relating to Dash, while shocks in OmiseGo persist the least and shocks in Bitcoin persist the most, although all of the considered cryptocurrencies possess high levels of persistence of volatility over time. We also demonstrate that the conditional covariances are significantly affected by both cross-products of past error terms and past conditional covariances, suggesting strong interdependencies between cryptocurrencies. It is also demonstrated that the Asymmetric Diagonal BEKK model is a superior choice of methodology, with our results suggesting significant asymmetric effects of positive and negative shocks in the conditional volatility of the price returns of all of our investigated cryptocurrencies, while the conditional covariances capture asymmetric effects of good and bad news accordingly. Finally, it is shown that time-varying conditional correlations exist, with our selected cryptocurrencies being strongly positively correlated, further highlighting interdependencies within cryptocurrency markets.

The development of the blockchain technology has enabled the cryptocurrency to invade the financial industry by providing, to some extent, an alternative banking system with extra benefits such as lower cost of transaction, faster transaction processing, and higher level of privacy. Bitcoin is the first completely decentralized digital currency to exist in the cryptocurrency market. People have adopted cryptocurrency for several reasons. This adoption is a purchasing decision where the users make the adoption decision based on set of factors that matter to them. This paper aims at evaluating the factors impacting the cryptocurrency adoption decision. To do so, we have identified the factors that the users consider when making the purchasing decision based on a comprehensive review of recent literature and expert's inputs. The objectives of the paper are to: (1) identify the factors impacting the adoption decision, (2) and determine the ranking of these factors based on the quantification of users' judgments. This paper proposes a hierarchical Decision Model (IIDM) to understand the users' decision to adopt cryptocurrency. The model suggests four main perspectives that influence the adoption decision namely: economic, technical, social, and personal. Every perspective consists of set of related criteria. We then used the pairwise comparison method to assess the importance of the perspectives and criteria to the overall objective of the model. The findings of this study suggest that users evaluate and make their decision mostly from economic and social perspectives. The top criteria found to influence the cryptocurrency adoption decision arc the investment opportunity, subjective norms, businesses acceptance, privacy, and global attention. This paper provides insights into the factors impacting the adoption decision and their importance level. It also helps the cryptocurrency developers to understand the consumers' adoption criteria to encourage cryptocurrency adoption.","[Alzahrani, Saeed; Daim, Tugrul U.] Portland State Univ, Engn & Technol Management Dept, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Alzahrani, Saeed] King Saud Univ, Management Inforinat Syst Dept, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Portland State University; King Saud University","Alzahrani, S (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Engn & Technol Management Dept, Portland, OR 97201 USA.;Alzahrani, S (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Management Inforinat Syst Dept, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","","","","","","","","51","4","4","1","5","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2159-5100","","978-1-890843-40-3","PORTL INT CONF MANAG","","","2019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering","BO5RJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000518681200134","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, the presence of Bitcoin's obvious shortcomings such as excessive electricity consumption, unsatisfying transaction throughput, and large validation time (latency) makes it clear that a new, more efficient system is needed. We propose a protocol in which a set of nodes maintains and updates a linear ordering of transactions that are being submitted by users. Virtually every cryptocurrency system has such a protocol at its core, and it is the efficiency of this protocol that determines the overall throughput and latency of the system. We develop our protocol on the grounds of the well-established field of Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (ABFT) systems. This allows us to formally reason about correctness, efficiency, and security in the strictest possible model, and thus convincingly prove the overall robustness of our solution. Our protocol improves upon the state-of-the-art HoneyBadgerBFT by Miller et al. by reducing the asymptotic latency while matching the optimal communication complexity. Furthermore, in contrast to the above, our protocol does not require a trusted dealer thanks to a novel implementation of a trustless ABFT Randomness Beacon.","[Gagol, Adam; Lesniak, Damian; Straszak, Damian; Swietek, Michal] Aleph Zero Fdn, Zug, Switzerland; [Gagol, Adam; Lesniak, Damian; Swietek, Michal] Jagiellonian Univ, Krakow, Poland","Jagiellonian University","Gagol, A (corresponding author), Aleph Zero Fdn, Zug, Switzerland.;Gagol, A (corresponding author), Jagiellonian Univ, Krakow, Poland.","","","","Aleph Zero Foundation","Aleph Zero Foundation","This research was funded by the Aleph Zero Foundation.","","43","14","14","0","1","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-6732-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","214","228","","10.1145/3318041.3355467","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3318041.3355467","","","15","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO5QB","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000518634900015","View Full Record in Web of Science"

While the cryptocurrency applications of a blockchain, such as Bitcoin, primarily store financial data in blockchain transactions, numerous approaches to arbitrarily insert other types of data are possible, including content in the form of readable text and images. Thus, considering the blockchain principles of decentralization, immutability, censorship resistance, and net neutrality, we are suddenly presented with a set of new challenges for mitigating the storage and distribution of illicit and potentially illegal data. Such a novel cybersecurity threat requires an adequate solution within a decentralized paradigm. In stark contrast to the countermeasures proposed in literature for filleting out illicit content from other legitimate data, this study proposes the first appropriately designed solution for effectively mitigating these threats whilst maintaining fidelity to the underlying core principles of the blockchain. Through the designed approach, arbitrary images in blockchain transactions are detected, and whilst leveraging an off-chain content filtering service, successful discrimination is achieved between clean and illicit embedded data. The proposed methodology was evaluated directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, successfully demonstrating a pioneering and viable approach for thwarting the insertion of child pornography images. The presented solution within this research is made available on GitHub [1] for open-source use.","[Cremona, Kirsten; Tabone, Donald; De Raffaele, Clifford] Middlesex Univ Malta, Fac Sci & Technol, Pembroke, Malta","","Cremona, K (corresponding author), Middlesex Univ Malta, Fac Sci & Technol, Pembroke, Malta.","kirstencremona@gmail.com; dtabone@gmail.com; cderaffaele@ieee.org","","","","","","","26","2","2","2","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2475-7020","","978-1-7281-2542-8","INT CONF CYBER DIST","","","2019","","","","","","","197","204","","10.1109/CyberC.2019.00042","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CyberC.2019.00042","","","8","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO7KO","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000524698400032","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It bridges the gap between findings in initial public offering (IPO) literature and empirical results from ICOs. Design/methodology/approach The sample set consists of 279 ICOs between April 2013 and January 2018. A regression analysis is performed with data from the ICOs. Findings The results show an average level of underpricing of ICOs of 123 percent in the USA and 97 percent in the other countries. The results for the US ICOs are significantly higher than for US IPOs on average and also higher than US IPOs at the beginning of the dot.com bubble. The authors also study the determinants of ICO underpricing. The authors use proxies based on asymmetric information from the IPO literature as well as ICO-related variables. First-day trading volume and a good sentiment on the ICO market go together with more ICO underpricing. Moreover, hot markets make first-day investors to benefit less. Finally, companies that use a large issue size or a pre-ICO (a sale of cryptocurrencies before the ICO) leave less money on the table. Practical implications The research may help in reducing underpricing, as the authors find that issuers can reduce it by holding a pre-ICO and by considering larger issue sizes. If they do so, investors will get fewer opportunities to benefit from underpricing. Investors can, nevertheless, also profit from the knowledge generated in this paper. When market sentiment is positive and first-day trading volume is expected to be high, investing in ICOs is likely to give them higher first-day returns. Finally, the authors hope that this paper will serve as a basis for further research into the exciting and dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Originality/value There is hardly any research on underpricing of ICOs. The paper is interesting for its table with a brief comparison of ICOs and IPOs. It also searches for variables from the asymmetric information theory behind IPOs to be applied in explaining ICOs. It shows high levels of ICO underpricing in comparison to IPOs. It also gives suggestions for issuers of (and investors in) ICOs.","[Felix, Thomas Heine] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands; [von Eije, Henk] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands","University of Groningen; University of Groningen","Felix, TH (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands.","thijnfelix@hotmail.com","von Eije, Henk/V-7158-2018","","","","","","47","18","18","1","24","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","0307-4358","1758-7743","","MANAG FINANC","Manag.

Blockchain and cryptocurrencies will dramatically transform how we do transactions, just as the Internet revolutionized how we communicate. Currently, more than 2,000 cryptocurrencies are quoted on the market, and many more are being launched in initial coin offerings for use as an exchange method in a specific business ecosystem or as rights to assets or liabilities. As an emerging fintech, cryptocurrencies open up many opportunities, but they also pose significant challenges and limitations. This paper analyzes the key factors for the successful development of a cryptocurrency from a consumer-behavior perspective. Using a technology acceptance theoretical framework, we test a model able to explain almost 85% of the intention to use cryptocurrencies. Surprisingly, risk was not a significant factor. This could be because most of the respondents considered operating with cryptocurrencies to be risky; the lack of variability in their responses to the questions about perceived risk would explain this lack of explanatory power. However, willingness to manage cryptocurrency risk could be a precondition for adoption. The performance expectancy for a given cryptocurrency was the most important factor for its success.

The consensus algorithms in Blockchain plays a major role and are crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of a distributed network. In addition, there are various problems arising from the consensus algorithms adopted in the existing Blockchain network. Therefore, it is of upmost importance to develop a consensus algorithm to address these problems. In this paper, therefore, we propose an efficient consensus algorithm in a Blockchain network environment consisting of several distributed users. First, we study the process of consensus among users to add new blocks to the existing Blockchain. Second, we introduce the other conventional consensus algorithms, analyze the problems of each algorithm, and propose Rock-Scissors-Paper (RSP) algorithm to mitigate these problems. The RSP algorithm is an algorithm that achieves consensus among distributed users using three static balanced variables, Rock (R), Scissors (S), and Paper (P) to avoid attacks by malicious participants. Furthermore, the propose RSP algorithm is compared with the existing consensus algorithms to predict the performance and its effects in a distributed mobile network environment.","[Kim, Dong-Hak; Ullah, Rehmat] Hongik Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Byung-Seo] Hongik Univ, Dept Software & Commun Engn, Seoul, South Korea","Hongik University; Hongik University","Kim, DH (corresponding author), Hongik Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Seoul, South Korea.","rlaehdgkr7@mail.hongik.ac.kr; trehmat_ciit@hotmail.com; jsnbs@hongik.ac.kr","Ullah, Rehmat/G-3430-2016","Ullah, Rehmat/0000-0002-6475-2434","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) through the Korea Government [2018R1A2B6002399]","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) through the Korea Government","This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) through the Korea Government (2018R1A2B6002399).","","11","2","2","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2576-8565","2576-8557","978-4-88552-320-5","ASIA-PAC NETW OPER M","","","2019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Telecommunications","BQ8EY","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000620140500082","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Payment networks overcome this limitation through off-chain transactions. Instead of writing to the blockchain for each transaction, they only settle the final payment balances with the underlying blockchain. When executing off-chain transactions in current payment networks, parties must access the blockchain within bounded time to detect misbehaving parties that deviate from the protocol. This opens a window for attacks in which a malicious party can steal funds by deliberately delaying other parties' blockchain access and prevents parties from using payment networks when disconnected from the blockchain. We present Teechain, the first layer-two payment network that executes off-chain transactions asynchronously with respect to the underlying blockchain. To prevent parties from misbehaving, Teechain uses treasuries, protected by hardware trusted execution environments (TEEs), to establish off-chain payment channels between parties. Treasuries maintain collateral funds and can exchange transactions efficiently and securely, without interacting with the underlying blockchain. To mitigate against treasury failures and to avoid having to trust all TEEs, Teechain replicates the state of treasuries using committee chains, a new variant of chain replication with threshold secret sharing. Teechain achieves at least a 33x higher transaction throughput than the state-of-the-art Lightning payment network. A 30-machine Teechain deployment can handle over 1 million Bitcoin transactions per second.","[Lind, Joshua; Kelbert, Florian; Pietzuch, Peter] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Naor, Oded; Eyal, Ittay] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Haifa, Israel; [Sirer, Emin Gun] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Imperial College London; Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Cornell University","Lind, J (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, London, England.","","","","European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the SecureCloud project [690111]; Israel Science Foundation; US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF); US National Science Foundation (NSF); Israel Cyber Bureau; Engima MPC Inc; Mel Berlin Cyber-Security Scholarship","European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the SecureCloud project; Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF)(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation); US National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Israel Cyber Bureau; Engima MPC Inc; Mel Berlin Cyber-Security Scholarship","We thank the anonymous reviewers and our shepherd, David Andersen, for their feedback and suggestions.

This article is aimed at the analysis and systematisation of the notion of cryptocurrency on the basis of selected digital and electronic money characteristics, including the determination of its place in the system of market values along with the classification of approaches to the regulation of cryptocurrency flows in European countries. Also this paper provides an individual interpretation of Burniske's formula to calculate the cryptocurrency monetary supply at global financial markets. The research stipulates the use of morphological and synthesis, structural and functional, and comparative legal types of analyses, including generalisation. The paper provides an analysis of the category and concept framework of digital currencies, in particular cryptocurrencies from the standpoint of tools used to develop the crypto infrastructure. The electronic currency as a means of value has certain advantages, if compared to the fiat currency, yet a lack of proper legal mechanism leads to collapse in its functioning in the financial market. It is also established that cryptocurrencies have high volatility resulting in the limitation of its functioning in certain states (Ecuador, Iceland, India, China, etc). The authors reveal characteristics and legal content of Burniske's formula which justifies the proportional relation between the product of currency flow velocity and gross monetary supply and the product of monetary supply price and circulation volume. National legislation must identify cryptocurrency as a financial means - an alternative for the unstable banking system and extension of economic rights of individuals and legal entities.","[Vozniuk, Andrii] Natl Acad Internal Affairs, Res Lab, 1 Solomianska Sq, UA-03035 Kiev, Ukraine; [Tytko, Anna] Natl Acad Internal Affairs, 1 Solomianska Sq, UA-03035 Kiev, Ukraine","","Vozniuk, A (corresponding author), Natl Acad Internal Affairs, Res Lab, 1 Solomianska Sq, UA-03035 Kiev, Ukraine.","vaa.999999@gmail.com; hanna.tytko@gmail.com","Tytko, Anna/AAP-3910-2020; Vozniuk, Andrii/AAJ-1865-2020; Tytko, Anna/S-2483-2017","Tytko, Anna/0000-0002-5669-2208; Vozniuk, Andrii/0000-0002-3352-5626; ","","","","","23","0","0","6","16","INST SOC TRANSFORMATION","KYIV","VUL GONCHARA 43-V, OFIS 20, KYIV, 01030, UKRAINE","1728-6220","1728-6239","","ECON ANN-XXI","Econ.

This paper proposes a tree chain architecture that adds peer-to-peer blockchain to main chain of the Ethereum. When there is a task to be processed in the main chain, the architecture assigns the task to branch or leaf. The branch first determines whether the task can be sliced. If the task can be sliced, divide the task into leaf nodes for processing, otherwise let the branch nodes handle. By assigning tasks in this way, it is possible to help the main chain reduce the computational pressure and increase the system throughput.","[Lin, Tanglin; Dong, Minggang; Jing, Chao] Guilin Univ Technol, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Guilin, Guangxi, Peoples R China","Guilin University of Technology","Dong, MG (corresponding author), Guilin Univ Technol, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Guilin, Guangxi, Peoples R China.","820087551@163.com; d2015mg@qq.com; jingchao@glut.edu.cn","Dong, minggang/GLQ-7019-2022","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61563012, 61203109]; Guangxi Natural Science Foundation [2014GXNSFAA118371, 2015GXNSFBA139260]; Innovation Project of Guangxi Graduate Education [YCSW2019162]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangxi Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province); Innovation Project of Guangxi Graduate Education","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61563012, 61203109), Guangxi Natural Science Foundation (2014GXNSFAA118371, 2015GXNSFBA139260), Innovation Project of Guangxi Graduate Education (YCSW2019162).","","19","0","0","0","0","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","","978-1-4503-6191-0","","","","2019","","","","","","","375","378","","10.1145/3378065.3378136","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3378065.3378136","","","4","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR4XF","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000653645300071","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This paper provides the first quantitative analysis on the fairness of the Atomic Swap protocol, and proposes the first fair Atomic Swap protocol with implementations. In particular, we model the Atomic Swap as the American Call Option, and prove that an Atomic Swap is equivalent to an American Call Option without the premium. Thus, the Atomic Swap is unfair to the swap participant. Then, we quantify the fairness of the Atomic Swap and compare it with that of conventional financial assets (stocks and fiat currencies). The quantification results show that the the Atomic Swap is much more unfair on cryptocurrencies than on stocks and fiat currencies in the same setting. Moreover, we use the conventional Cox-Ross-Rubinstein option pricing model in Finance to estimate the premium, and show that the estimated premium for cryptocurrencies is 2%similar to 3% of the asset value, while the premium for stocks and fiat currencies is approximately 0.3%. Furthermore, we propose two fair Atomic Swap protocols, one is for currency exchange and the other is for American Call Options. Our protocols are based on the original Atomic Swap protocol, but implement the premium mechanism. Blockchains supporting smart contracts such as Ethereum support our protocols directly. Blockchains only supporting scripts such as Bitcoin can support our protocols by adding a simple opcode. Finally, we provide the reference implementation of our protocols in Solidity, and give detailed instructions on implementing our protocols with Bitcoin script.","[Han, Runchao; Yu, Jiangshan] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Han, Runchao] CSIRO, Data61, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Monash University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)","Han, RC (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia.;Han, RC (corresponding author), CSIRO, Data61, Canberra, ACT, Australia.","runchao.han@monash.edu; chris.haoyul@gmail.com; jiangshan.yu@monash.edu","Yu, Jiangshan/AAC-9520-2019","Yu, Jiangshan/0000-0001-8006-7392","","","","","28","16","16","2","2","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-6732-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","62","75","","10.1145/3318041.3355460","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3318041.3355460","","","14","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO5QB","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000518634900005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation based topic modeling, we identify discussion topics from the two Blockchain related StackExchange sites. We manually investigated the posts belonging to each topic to understand challenges encountered by the developers. The results of our study revealed that while the ratios of posts on BCS development are increasing, the ratios of posts on mining cryptocurrencies are decreasing. Due to the scarcity of expert blockchain developers, posts on BCS development are more likely to go either answered or encounter more delays than posts on other topics.

However, research shows that NC fails to achieve perfect chain quality, allowing malicious miners to alter the public ledger in order to launch several attacks, i.e., selfish mining, double-spending and feather-forking. Some later designs, represented by Ethereum, Bitcoin-NG, DECOR+, Byzcoin and Publish or Perish, aim to solve the problem by raising the chain quality; other designs, represented by Fruitchains, DECOR+ and Subchains, claim to successfully defend against the attacks in the absence of perfect chain quality. As their effectiveness remains self-claimed, the community is divided on whether a secure PoW protocol is possible. In order to resolve this ambiguity and to lay down the foundation of a common body of knowledge, this paper introduces a multi-metric evaluation framework to quantitatively analyze PoW protocols' chain quality and attack resistance. Subsequently we use this framework to evaluate the security of these improved designs through Markov decision processes. We conclude that to date, no PoW protocol achieves ideal chain quality or is resistant against all three attacks. We attribute existing PoW protocols' imperfect chain quality to their unrealistic security assumptions, and their unsatisfactory attack resistance to a dilemma between rewarding the bad and punishing the good. Moreover, our analysis reveals various new protocol-specific attack strategies. Based on our analysis, we propose future directions toward more secure PoW protocols and indicate several common pitfalls in PoW security analyses.","[Zhang, Ren] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Nervos, Leuven, Belgium; [Zhang, Ren; Preneel, Bart] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Imec COSIC, Leuven, Belgium","KU Leuven; KU Leuven","Zhang, R (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Nervos, Leuven, Belgium.;Zhang, R (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Imec COSIC, Leuven, Belgium.","ren@nervos.org; bart.preneel@esat.kuleuven.be","Zhang, Ren/T-7141-2017; Preneel, Bart/O-3798-2016","Zhang, Ren/0000-0003-2063-1769; Preneel, Bart/0000-0003-2005-9651","Flemish government imec ICON BoSS project; Research Council KU Leuven [C16/15/058]","Flemish government imec ICON BoSS project; Research Council KU Leuven(KU Leuven)","This work was supported in part by Blockstream, the Flemish government imec ICON BoSS project, and the Research Council KU Leuven: C16/15/058.

For safety against double-spending, a bitcoin transaction is only considered to be unrevokable after it is within a chain of at least six mined blocks on the blockchain termed six confirmations for short. Besides the use for securing financial activity, blockchain technology is now also merged with various emerging applications, including Internet of Things (IoT) and vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET). However, such emerging applications may have comparatively low Internet connectivity due to incorporating mobile devices, that may range away from network infrastructure. This paper investigates the impact of network latency on blockchain forking behavior and possible violations of the aforementioned six confirmations convention for transaction approval. To speed up our simulations, we simplify the blockchain's data structure, and avoid the extensive computation required in proof-of-work (PoW). Through simulation, we show that the six confirmations convention is sensitive to the peer-to-peer network latency, and also show how quickly it is violated with an easier difficulty of PoW mining. Unsurprisingly, the speed at which all nodes on the blockchain converge is shown to be severely affected by the latency of the underlying peer-to-peer network. It is also shown the extent to which nodes with more frequent Internet connectivity can gain an unfair advantage in terms of proof-ofwork mining rewards. We thus recommend that networks with heterogeneous latency profiles across nodes monitor fairness, and potentially preclude some nodes from being miners.","[Wan, Luming; Eyers, David; Zhang, Haibo] Univ Otago, Dept Comp Sci, Dunedin, New Zealand","University of Otago","Wan, LM (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Comp Sci, Dunedin, New Zealand.","lwan@cs.otago.ac.nz; dme@cs.otago.ac.nz; haibo@cs.otago.ac.nz","Eyers, David/AAW-4836-2020","Eyers, David/0000-0002-7284-8006","","","","","20","13","14","1","2","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-4693-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","194","201","","10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00033","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00033","","","8","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO8PX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000528931600024","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A cryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses code to verify transactions via a peer-to-peer network. Since 2016, emerging technology companies have increasingly opted to conduct initial coin offerings (ICO) to fund the development of their networks rather than pitch to venture capitalists or hold an IPO. In an ICO, developers sell a new cryptocurrency, sometimes called a token, that allows exclusive access to their network without selling off equity or granting investors voting rights. Retail investors looking for the next cryptocurrency to make Bitcoin-level gains in value are investing significant capital into these tokens without the protections afforded by the SEC for similar investment opportunities. In 2017, billions of dollars were raised by these ICOs, and many investors were duped by fraudulent sales. This year, ICOs are on pace to raise over $10 billion. The U.S. government has regulated ICOs inconsistently. The SEC identifies most ICO tokens as securities, the IRS taxes them as property, and the FinCEN regulates them as money. For the SEC, applying the traditional Howey test to these tokens has proven difficult. While some tokens are clearly securities, others may not be, due to their independent utility as a means to access proprietary networks. Regardless, SEC warnings have not subdued ICOs. This Comment presents a new legal framework that meets the interests of the SEC, investors, and the innovative companies in the cryptocurrency industry.","[Essaghoolian, Nareg] UCLA, Sch Law, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Essaghoolian, Nareg] Calif State Univ Northridge, Northridge, CA 91330 USA","University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; California State University System; California State University Northridge","Essaghoolian, N (corresponding author), UCLA, Sch Law, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Essaghoolian, N (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Northridge, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.","","","","","","","","188","7","7","2","21","UNIV CALIF","LOS ANGELES","SCH LAW 405 HILGARD AVE, LOS ANGELES, CA 90024 USA","0041-5650","","","UCLA LAW REV","UCLA Law Rev.","JAN","2019","66","1","","","","","294","343","","","","","","50","Law","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Government & Law","HI9HK","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000456765700005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The methodology contains formal-legal methods and comparative law techniques, as well as logical and systematic ways of interpretation of rules and regulations. The results: The investigation reveals that Articles 272 and 273 of the RF's Criminal Code as presently in force don't admit of applying these measures to individuals committing the given crimes for the purpose of affecting information and telecommunication networks and points out that definite regulations related to computerized data crimes take into account neither a dramatic increase in crime danger to the public in the area of blockchain functioning and cryptocurrency turnover nor the identity of criminals of a relevant category. The conclusion proposes the following amendments: (1) to edit both Part 1 Article 272 and Part 1 Article 273 of the RF's Criminal Code in order to eliminate the aforementioned neglected issues; (2) to assign the status of a qualifying element: (a) to the way of committing a crime in the area of computerized data in relation to the intervention in the operation of information and telecommunication networks (Part 2 Article 1596); (b) to the effect after unauthorized access to the computerized data by way of intervening in the information and telecommunication network (Part 2 Article 272 of the RF's Criminal Code); (c) to the target of crime (Part 2 Article 273 of the RF's Criminal Code), i.e., the creation, use and distribution of malware aimed to intervene in the operation of information and telecommunication networks; (3) to amend Part 1 Article 63 of the RF's Criminal Code by inserting a new section committing a crime with the use of specific knowledge and (or) special skills.","[Mkrtchian, Sona M.] Volgograd State Univ, Dept Criminal Law, Volgograd, Russia","Volgograd State University (VOLSU)","Mkrtchian, SM (corresponding author), Volgograd State Univ, Dept Criminal Law, Volgograd, Russia.","s.mkrtchian1992@volsu.ru","Mkrtchian, Sona/ABA-6578-2021","","","","","","12","2","2","0","2","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","1860-949X","1860-9503","978-3-030-13397-9; 978-3-030-13396-2","STUD COMPUT INTELL","","","2019","826","","","","","","355","361","","10.1007/978-3-030-13397-9_41","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-13397-9_41","10.1007/978-3-030-13397-9","","7","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Information Science & Library Science; Law","Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)","Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science; Government & Law","BN7KN","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000487332600042","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Conversely, to enable transactions in a disaster area, current payment systems need communication infrastructures (such as wired networks and cellular networks) which may be ruined during such disasters as large-scale earthquakes and flooding and thus cannot be depended on in a disaster area. In this paper, we introduce a new mobile payment system utilizing infrastructure-less mobile adhoc networks to enable transactions that permit users to shop in disaster areas. Specifically, we introduce an endorsement-based mechanism to provide payment guarantees for a customer-to-merchant transaction and a multilevel endorsement (MLE) mechanism with a lightweight scheme based on Bloom filter and Merkle tree to reduce communication overheads. Our mobile payment system achieves secure transaction by adopting various schemes such as location-based mutual monitoring scheme and blind signature, while our newly introduced event chain mechanism prevents double spending attacks. As validated by simulations, the proposed mobile payment system is useful in a disaster area, achieving high transaction completion ratio, 65%-90% for all scenario tested, and is storage-efficient for mobile devices with an overall average of 7 MB merchant message size.","[Ojetunde, Babatunde; Shibata, Naoki; Gao, Juntao] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Informat Sci, Nara 6300192, Japan","Nara Institute of Science & Technology","Ojetunde, B (corresponding author), Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Informat Sci, Nara 6300192, Japan.","ojetunde.babatunde.nq3@is.naist.jp; n-sibata@is.naist.jp; jtgao@is.naist.jp","Shibata, Naoki/AAH-5104-2019","Shibata, Naoki/0000-0002-9430-5555; Ojetunde, Babatunde/0000-0001-9897-0774","Otsuka Toshimi Scholarship Foundation [16-S38, 17-S72]; JSPS KAKENHI [JP16K12421, JP15K15981, JP16K01288]","Otsuka Toshimi Scholarship Foundation(Otsuka Pharmaceutical); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported in part by the Otsuka Toshimi Scholarship Foundation under Grant 16-S38 and Grant 17-S72, and in part by JSPS KAKENHI under Grant JP16K12421, Grant JP15K15981, and Grant JP16K01288.

In Bitcoin and similar e-cash systems, privacy is limited to anonymity and addressed by using cryptographic pseudonyms for identification and authentication of parties. Privacy has more breadth in systems maintaining actual data such as medical records or energy meters. In this paper, we look into recently proposed privacy-preserving blockchains, analyze their strengths and weaknesses, and highlight research questions requiring future investigation.

The findings indicate that observed cryptocurrencies could be regarded as a new asset class, a fully digital, sui-generis financial instruments, as they are not coherently connected to the stock market. However, allocating capital into cryptocurrencies remains in the domain of pure speculation due to their strong volatility.","[Sajter, Domagoj] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ, Osijek, Croatia","University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek","Sajter, D (corresponding author), JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ, Osijek, Croatia.","sajter@efos.hr","Sajter, Domagoj/AAC-3874-2022","Sajter, Domagoj/0000-0001-5492-3570","","","","","11","3","3","2","2","UNIV DUBROVNIK","DUBROVNIK","BRANITELJ DUBROVNIKA 29, DUBROVNIK, 20000, CROATIA","1330-1039","1848-963X","","EKON MISAO PRAKSA","Ekon.

Disintermediation become the keyword defining many e-commerce technologies. Bitcoin, the original application motivated development of Blockchain technology, aimed removing banks as the mediators and trusted third party in financial transactions. But the scope of this underlying technology is much broader than purely the word of cryptocurrency. Blockchain technology offers new paradigm of connectivity, information exchange and information use, exploring decentralized, distributed data processing, and encrypting via public and private keys. Blockchain was launched as the underlying technology in introducing bitcoins. Research conducted on the dynamics of publications addressing Blockchain, shows that this technology deserted recently from purely bitcoin / crypto-currencies application domain. The intensity of publication addressing applications of this technology demonstrated its relevance to different business domains, mostly Internet of Things (IoT), but also sectors as Energy, Healthcare, and Finance, mostly related to retailed services. Consideration of Blockchain technology from this broader perspective, justify the needs of introducing it to students in fields like Computer Science, Information Systems, and Information Technology, but it is especially valuable for programs training Data Science competences. The paper shares experience of introducing Blockchain technology, which is still in its infantry stage according to maturity life cycle, in Data Science Master Program. Resolving problems like lack of sufficient well-developed training materials, lack of competent trainers, and lack of adequate equipment to experiment are among the overcome major barriers. Dynamics of innovations in area of information technologies and shortening the life cycle from discovery to wide distribution forces education institutions, traditionally conservative in adopting innovation, to develop experience in fast adjustment of their curriculum to react to the emerging challenges. The case of incorporated Blockchain related content into curriculum is discussed as a possible practice.","[Toleva-Stoimenova, Stefka; Rasheva-Yordanova, Katia] Univ Lib Studies & Informat Technol, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Christozov, Dimitar] Amer Univ Bulgaria, Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria","University for Library Studies & Information Technology; American University Bulgaria","Toleva-Stoimenova, S (corresponding author), Univ Lib Studies & Informat Technol, Sofia, Bulgaria.","","Toleva-Stoimenova, Stefka/AAT-4719-2021; Christozov, Dimitar/AAN-4072-2020; Рашева-Йорданова, Катя/ABC-4557-2020","Christozov, Dimitar/0000-0002-5780-3117; Рашева-Йорданова, Катя/0000-0001-5859-9114","National Science Fund at the Ministry of Education and Science, Republic of Bulgaria [DM 12/4 - 20/12/2017]","National Science Fund at the Ministry of Education and Science, Republic of Bulgaria","This work has been supported by National Science Fund at the Ministry of Education and Science, Republic of Bulgaria, within the Project DM 12/4 - 20/12/2017.","","12","0","0","0","5","FILODIRITTO PUBLISHER","BOLOGNA","INFOROMATICA SRL, VIA CASTIGLIONE, 81, BOLOGNA, 40124, ITALY","","","978-88-85813-45-8","","","","2019","","","","","","","186","190","","","","","","5","Education & Educational Research","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Education & Educational Research","BO1CO","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000494943300030","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Public proof-of-work based networks specifically, despite their limitations and challenges, continue to be popular due to their simplicity and intuitiveness. However, for such networks to perpetually meet viability, efficiency, security and environmental sustainability objectives, they need to adapt to environmental changes via continuous reconfiguration of their operating parameters. In this paper, we attempt to formulate this blockchain network adaptability problem as one of control engineering. We sketch the basic characteristics of blockchain networks as systems and identify variables available for designing a controller that allows such networks to attain macroscopic operating objectives. By means of describing and simulating a simple idealized proportional controller, we demonstrate the benefits and some of the challenges in designing such controllers.","[Liaskos, Sotirios] York Univ, Sch Informat Technol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wang, Bo; Alimohammadi, Nahid] York Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada","York University - Canada; York University - Canada","Liaskos, S (corresponding author), York Univ, Sch Informat Technol, Toronto, ON, Canada.","liaskos@yorku.ca; bowang@eecs.yorku.ca; nalim@eecs.yorku.ca","","","","","","","26","2","2","0","1","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-3368-3","","","","2019","","","","","","","139","145","","10.1109/SEAMS.2019.00025","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SEAMS.2019.00025","","","7","Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BQ4FJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000589350700015","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This paper focuses on the prediction of the global computing power.

As we examine data in the most recent year, we find that surprisingly more than one principal component appears to explain the cross-sectional variation. Second, similar to hedge fund returns, cryptocurrency returns suffer from the beta-in-the-tails hidden risk. Third, we find that predicting cryptocurrency movements with machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms is marginally attractive with variation in predictability power per crypto-currency. Fourth, lower volatile cryptocurrencies are slightly more predictable than more volatile ones. Fifth, evidence exists that efficacy of distinct information sets varies across machine learning algorithms, showing that predictability may be much more complex given a set of machine learning algorithms. Finally, short-term predictability is very tenuous, which suggests that near-term cryptocurrency markets are semi-strong form efficient and therefore, day trading cryptocurrencies may be very challenging.","[Liew, Jim Kyung-Soo] Johns Hopkins Univ, Carey Business Sch, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Li, Richard Ziyuan; Budavari, Tamas] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Sharma, Avinash] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bioengn & Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University","Liew, JKS (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Carey Business Sch, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.","kliew1@jhu.edu","","","","","","","19","3","3","1","2","BRITISH BLOCKCHAIN ASSOC","LONDON","KEMP HOUSE 152-160 CITY RD, LONDON, EC1V 2NX, ENGLAND","","2516-3957","","J BRIT BLOCKCHAIN AS","J.

This paper builds a model for blockchain core protocol, and adopts the trace semantics, i.e. a sequence of actions, which can record any possible conditions that the running protocol may reach.

In these systems, a miner will consume significant time and resources to obtain a reward for contributing to the blockchain. To overcome these limitations, recent research on blockchains are focused on accelerating the speed, scalability, and enhancing the security level. By enhancing specific procedures of blockchain system, the level of data integrity supported by the blockchain can become more robust, and efficient. In this paper, a new blockchain consensus model based on the Bryllite Consensus Protocol (BCP) is proposed to support a hyper-connected massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) ecosystem. The BCP scheme enables users to participate directly in new consensus processes through a Proof of Participation (PoP) algorithm. In this model, the consensus algorithm has a simpler form while maintaining high security level. In addition, because the BCP scheme gives users an equal chance to make a contribution to the blockchain, rewards are distributed in an equal fashion, which motivates user participation. The analysis of the proposed scheme is applied to the Bryllite consortium blockchain system (homed in Hong Kong), which is a new blockchain network developed for international game industries, gamers, and game events.","[Yun, Jusik; Goh, Yunyeong; Chung, Jong-Moon] Yonsei Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, OkSeok; Shin, SangWoo; Choi, Jin; Kim, Yoora] HanbitSoft, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, OkSeok; Shin, SangWoo; Choi, Jin; Kim, Yoora] Bryllite, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Yonsei University","Chung, JM (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Seoul, South Korea.","awp212@yonsei.ac.kr; rhdbsdud@yonsei.ac.kr; jmc@yonsei.ac.kr; jade@hanbitsoft.co.kr; swoows@hanbitsoft.co.kr; program@t3.co.kr; yoora@t3.co.kr","","","MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT) of the Republic of Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program [IITP-2019-2018-0-01799]","MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT) of the Republic of Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program","A preliminary version of this paper was presented at ICONI 2018, where it received the Outstanding Paper Award.

The compilation of 102 articles found in the scientific literature were presented in the Blockchain context, providing a reference for the fields of blockchain applications. Results: The results indicate a large increase in the number of articles published since 2017, the largest number of publications were written by authors affiliated with institutions located in China, as well as the most referenced applications are related to cryptocurrencies, smart contracts and IoT. Limitations of the investigation: The limitation lies in using only the Scopus database for bibliometry, despite being a renowned scientific base. Practical implications: This study can serve as a bibliographic reference with a global view of the main Blockchain applications that can be applied by different types of organizations Originality/value: Blockchain is a technology that aims to securely store data, such as financial data, contracts, proof of identity, documents of possession, medical information, etc. To do so, a framework based on laws of mathematics and cryptography is used to ensure the security of transactions of different applications, such as Bitcoin, which is a digital currency that guarantees the safe transfer of financial data. However, being a new technology, there is still little research on the subject. On the other hand, there are different types of applications that are already benefiting from the blockchain structure.","[Meirino, Marcelo Jasmim; Mexas, Mirian Picinini; Faria, Alexandre do Valle; Mexas, Rodrigo Picinini; Meirelles, Geisa Drumond] Fluminense Fed Univ UFF, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil","Universidade Federal Fluminense","Meirino, MJ (corresponding author), Fluminense Fed Univ UFF, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.","marcelojm@id.uff.br; mirian_mexas@id.uff.br; avalle.faria@gmail.com; rodrigopicinini@id.uff.br; meirellesdrumond@gmail.com","Meiriño, Marcelo J/M-1958-2016; Méxas, Mirian Picinini/M-6670-2018","Meiriño, Marcelo J/0000-0001-9165-2300; Méxas, Mirian Picinini/0000-0003-4506-7009","Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [430119/2016-0]; FOPESQ","Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FOPESQ","The research was supported by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) - Universal Call 01-2016, Process Number: 430119/2016-0; and FOPESQ Call 2017 Proppi UFF.","","112","3","3","5","45","ASSOC BRASILEIRA ENGENHARIA PRODUCAO-ABEPRO","SAO PAULO","AV PROF ALMEIDA PRADO 531, 1O ANDAR, SALA 102, SAO PAULO, 05508-900, BRAZIL","2237-8960","","","BRAZ J OPER PROD MAN","Braz.

It simulates the peer-to-peer network of a public blockchain, e.g., Bitcoin, which consists of thousands of nodes, as well as parameters related to a blockchain and its network are flexibly configurable. SimBlock can also visualize nodes' behavior and block propagation.

The breakthrough blockchain technology and the prospects for its application attract more and more attention of specialists and the general public, associated with the formation of fundamentally new outlines of a globally integrated and high-tech digital economic system. At the same time, the idea of Bitcoin itself is more likely to cause cautious reactions and fears, primarily from governments and regulatory authorities, which see the spread of cryptographic currencies as a challenge to traditional monetary institutions, including the state monopoly on money. The authors of the article reflect on the problems of cryptocurrency market regulation in the context of this public discourse, which is taking place against the background of growing discontent with respect to the traditional institutions of the monetary and financial system. The official positions of the financial authorities on the development of the cryptocurrency industry are discussed. The European - namely, German - experience of regulation of the sphere of cryptocurrency circulation is presented. It is noted that Russian experience differs from that of a number of foreign countries, in which certain approaches to civil law interpretation and the development of adapted norms and rules for interacting with cryptocurrencies have already been formed. Russia still lacks any legal definition as well as clear legislative regulation of cryptocurrencies. The cautious position of Russian regulators is determined by the need for a more thorough study of the economic and legal nature of private digital means of payment in order to prevent risks of financial losses for consumers and eliminate possible threats to the stability of the financial and economic system as a whole. An appeal to the late legacy of Friedrich August von Hayek and his ideas regarding the denationalization of monetary systems will help to clarify the potential dynamics of this situation.","[Doerr, Julian] Familienunternehmer eV, German Assoc Family Owned Enterprises, Digitalizat, Berlin, Germany; [Kowalski, Olaf] Univ Bonn, Dept Constitut Law, Inst Publ Law, Res Ctr Normat Fdn Soc, Bonn, Germany; [Nevskiy, Sergey I.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Moscow, Russia","University of Bonn; Lomonosov Moscow State University","Dorr, J (corresponding author), Familienunternehmer eV, German Assoc Family Owned Enterprises, Digitalizat, Berlin, Germany.","jdoerr1@uni-bonn.de; olafkowalski@uni-bonn.de; nevskij@econ.msu.ru","","","","","","","49","0","1","2","18","SOUTHERN FEDERAL UNIV","ROSTOV-ON-DON","OF 211, GORGOKO ST, 88, ROSTOV-ON-DON, 344002, RUSSIA","2073-6606","","","TERRA ECON","Terra Econ.","","2019","17","4","","","","","6","22","","10.23683/2073-6606-2019-17-4-6-22","http://dx.doi.org/10.23683/2073-6606-2019-17-4-6-22","","","17","Economics","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Business & Economics","JY6BG","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000504497400001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The results demonstrate that the OTS service is highly reliable with a zero false positive and false negative error rate for timestamp attestations, but that it is not suitable for time-sensitive timestamping due to the variance of the accuracy of timestamps induced by block confirmation times in the Bitcoin blockchain.","[Motara, Yusuf Moosa] Rhodes Univ, Comp Sci, Grahamstown, South Africa","Rhodes University","Motara, YM (corresponding author), Rhodes Univ, Comp Sci, Grahamstown, South Africa.","","Motara, Yusuf M/H-6933-2013","Motara, Yusuf M/0000-0003-1340-260X","","","","","22","4","5","2","7","SOUTH AFRICAN INST ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS","JOHANNESBURG","PO BOX 93541 YEOVILLE, JOHANNESBURG, 2143, SOUTH AFRICA","1991-1696","","","SAIEE AFR RES J","SAIEE Afr.

Barring the divergent opinions on whether permitted in Islamic law (that is/are halal) or forbidden in Islamic law (that is/are haram), and for which the swing tends to be in favor of its blockchain underlying technology permissibility in Islam, cryptocurrencies are undoubtedly indicating potential for relevance in the global trade, investment, and other contract settlements in some years to come. The potential of the blockchain technology is phenomenal with recent estimates suggesting it will be worth more than $20 trillion in just two years, which is more than the entire American economy. Since fortunes are made by those entrepreneurs and indeed savvy investors who have discerned its future potential earlier on, there exists some great temptation for people to jump on the blockchain bandwagon. Apparently the growing acceptability of digital fiat money as a result of technology development on one hand, and the failure of the paper money to mitigate inflation and other economic disequilibria since the disappearance of the gold standard on the other, various forms of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoins (referred to as the king) appear to roar toward wider recognition. However, an emerging phenomenon associated with cryptocurrency revolution is an observed significant fluctuation (the tide) in its value and thus a subject of discussion within Islamic finance community and beyond. In the midst of this also is the current agitation founded on some of the Islamic law (Shari'a) view on the necessity of asset-backed money, to be extended to the current cryptocurrency innovation for its transformation into a Shari.a compliant precious metal backed currency. The big question now which this chapter sought to provide the answer is, what are the implications of these developments to a more established and widening global phenomenon of Islamic finance and its development in Muslim world vis-a-vis aspirations for sustained economic development. The work finds that cryptocurrencies would generate three advantages over all forms of money including gold through: establishing a unified financial system through its standard decentralization, being rarer than gold and its significant mitigation of inflation. It is also noted that the prevalent foreign exchange risk resulting from the underlying activities (rather than the currency itself) is free from speculation (Gharar). It is, therefore, recommended that stakeholders in the Islamic Finance world should not be passive but be proactive in commencing processes to develop technical notes, standards, and operational guidelines to partake in the inevitable migration to cryptocurrencies.","[Abubakar, Mustapha] Ahmadu Bello Univ, Zaria, Nigeria; [Hassan, M.

This paper reviews the typical vulnerabilities that are widespread during development in the Solidity language. It also presents an analysis of existing tools to help identify software bugs.

However, slow transaction speed, high demand of resources, and scalability have become the bottlenecks that limit the blockchain's applicability. Instead of a chain, IOTA is a network of tangle distributed ledger in order to offer higher scalability and quicker transaction time, compared to blockchain. In this paper, we propose a new TSGP (Tree Solve Graph Problem) tip selection algorithm for IOTA. Our experiments show that our algorithm performs better than tip selection algorithms in the literature.

In this tutorial, we discuss the basic protocols used in blockchain, and elaborate on its main advantages and limitations. To overcome these limitations, we provide the necessary distributed systems background in managing large scale fully replicated ledgers, using Byzantine Agreement protocols to solve the consensus problem. Finally, we expound on some of the most recent proposals to design scalable and efficient blockchains in both permissionless and permissioned settings.

That is, even after neutralizing the attack, the targeted files remain encrypted and cannot be accessed without the decryption key. Thus, it is imperative to detect such a threat early, i.e. in the initial phases before the encryption takes place. However, the lack of sufficient information in initial phases of the attack is the main challenge to early detection, leading to low detection accuracy and a high rate of false alarms. This is due to the way that the existing solutions have been designed based on, which assumes the availability of complete information about the behavior of such attacks at detection time. Nevertheless, this does not hold for early detection that takes place while the attack is underway, and data are not fully available. To address such limitations, this paper proposes two novel techniques; incremental bagging (iBagging) and enhanced semi-random subspace selection (ESRS), and incorporates them into an ensemble-based detection model. The proposed iBagging was firstly used to build incremental subsets in a way that reflects the progression of crypto-ransomware behavior during its different attack phases. ESRS was then used to build optimal, noise-free and diverse features subspaces, by which, a pool of classifiers was trained. Finally, a grid search was employed to select the best combination of base classifiers. Majority voting was utilized for the final decision. The experimental evaluation of the proposed techniques and model was conducted and compared with the existing crypto-ransomware early detection solutions. The results demonstrate that the proposed techniques and model overcame the data limitation in the early phases of the attacks and achieved higher detection accuracy than existing solutions.

In decentralized applications (Dapps), parts of the business logic and the data storage of traditional web applications are replaced with smart contracts. They are credited with considerable potential for commercial use, especially in FinTech but also beyond. Smart contracts mostly lack explicit legal regulation as well.

This has led to the development of several attack strategies such as block withholding (BWH) and fork after withholding (FAW) attacks that can weaken the health of PoW systems and but maximize mining pools' profits. In this paper, we present strategies called Adaptive Retaliation Strategies (ARS) to mitigate not only BWH attacks but also FAW attacks. In ARS, each pool cooperates with other pools in the normal situation, and adaptively executes either FAW or BWH attacks for the purpose of retaliation only when attacked. In addition, in order for rational pools to adopt ARS, ARS should strike to an adaptive balance between retaliation and selfishness because the pools consider their payoff even when they retaliate. We theoretically and numerically show that ARS would not only lead to the induction of a no-attack state among mining pools, but also achieve the adaptive balance between retaliation and selfishness.","[Kwon, Yujin; Yi, Yung; Kim, Yongdae] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Daejeon, South Korea; [Kim, Hyoungshick] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, South Korea","Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)","Kwon, Y (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Daejeon, South Korea.","dbwls8724@kaist.ac.kr; hyoung@skku.edu; yiyung@kaist.ac.kr; yongdaek@kaist.ac.kr","","","Institute for Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT) [2016-0-00160]; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT [2016R1A2A2A05921755]","Institute for Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT); Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT","This work was supported by Institute for Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2016-0-00160, Versatile Network System Architecture for Multi-dimensional Diversity); This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (No. 2016R1A2A2A05921755).","","29","1","1","0","0","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-6732-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","169","182","","10.1145/3318041.3355472","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3318041.3355472","","","14","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO5QB","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000518634900012","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In order to cope with the security threats from participants, a blockchain-based crowdsensing framework is proposed, which helps check the authentication of submitted sensor data and resists record tempering. Moreover, a bitcoin-based reward delivery scheme is designed to prevent requesters from denying payments. The sensing capability differences between users are considered in our design. Through security analysis and simulations evaluation, the performance superiority of the proposed framework and reward delivery scheme is demonstrated, in terms of malicious behaviour detection, user utility and sensor data quality.","[Gu, Xin; Peng, Jun; Cheng, Yijun; Jiang, Fu; Zhang, Xiaoyong; Huang, Zhiwu] Cent S Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Yu, Wentao] Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Coll Comp & Informat Engn, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Gu, Xin; Peng, Jun; Yu, Wentao; Cheng, Yijun; Jiang, Fu; Zhang, Xiaoyong; Huang, Zhiwu] Hunan Engn Lab Rail Vehicles Braking Technol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Cai, Lin] Univ Victoria, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Victoria, BC, Canada","Central South University; Central South University of Forestry & Technology; University of Victoria","Zhang, XY (corresponding author), Cent S Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.;Zhang, XY (corresponding author), Hunan Engn Lab Rail Vehicles Braking Technol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.","zhangxy@csu.edu.cn","Cai, Lin/AAA-6667-2021; Cai, Lin/C-3286-2016","Cai, Lin/0000-0002-1093-4865; Cai, Lin/0000-0002-1093-4865","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61772558, 61873353, 61672537, 61803394, 61672539, 61502055, 61503048, 61602529]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The authors would like to acknowledge that this work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61772558, 61873353, 61672537, 61803394, 61672539, 61502055, 61503048 and 61602529).","","17","7","7","0","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2163-5137","","978-1-7281-3666-0","PROC IEEE INT SYMP","","","2019","","","","","","","1859","1864","","","","","","6","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering","BO1LA","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000500998700280","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Stablecoins, i.e. coins that rely on flexible supply designs, are also not backed by a We Owe You and cannot achieve price stability because they build on outdated monetarist theories. Moreover, the algorithmically planned allocation of new coins, which is characteristic of stablecoins, is not market-based. As such, it is inferior to contemporary ways of money creation. Regarding price stability, we suggest that (crypto) monetary policy needs to overcome the illusionary dichotomy between the real and the financial circuit by accounting for systematic coordinated wage bargaining mechanisms to reflect that firms set prices according to cost-based pricing rules.","[Senner, Richard] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Sornette, Didier] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Entrepreneurial Risks, Zurich, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich","Senner, R (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland.","","","","","","","","102","6","6","5","21","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0021-3624","1946-326X","","J ECON ISSUES","J.

The task of committing the recent trade data to independent cryptocurrency systems presents an all-or-nothing fairness problem, to which we present ideal theoretical solutions, as well as practical solutions. Tesseract supports not only real-time cross-chain cryptocurrency trades, but also secure tokenization of assets pegged to cryptocurrencies.

According to known vulnerabilities of different consensus algorithms, censorship attacks can always achieve great benefits at low costs by various means. In this paper, we propose improvements to existing POS and POW algorithms to resolve censorship attacks in two methods. The first method improves the Tendermint consensus mechanism by introducing three new types of messages and an auxiliary role of network nodes. The method can automatically defend against censorship attacks and organize an honest chain. The second method is based on the CasperFFG consensus mechanism and can accurately identify the attackers by evaluating the suspicious scores of all validators. However, an honest validator has to manually choose the honest chain. Theoretical analyses show their effectiveness.","[Xian, Xiangbin; Zhou, Yu; Guo, Yurong; Yang, Zhenguo; Liu, Wenyin] Guangdong Univ Technol, Web Ident Secur Lab, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Guangdong University of Technology","Xian, XB (corresponding author), Guangdong Univ Technol, Web Ident Secur Lab, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.","1245549353@qq.com; yuzhou_1su@163.com; 867837489@qq.com; zhengyang5-c@my.cityu.edu.hk; liuwy@gdut.edu.cn","","","","","","","8","0","0","1","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-8500-6","","","","2019","","","","","","","718","723","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BO5XI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000518988100102","View Full Record in Web of Science"

As such, Markov automata provide the ingredients that enable the study of a wide range of quantitative properties related to risk, cost, performance, and strategy. This tutorial paper gives an introduction to the formalism of Markov automata, to practical modelling of Markov automata in the Modest language, and to their analysis with the MODEST TOOLSET.

The vast majority of these proposed protocols use a trusted third party (TTP) to achieve fairness. The few solutions without a TTP have not been successful due to their high computational and/or communication cost. Blockchain provides a new approach to develop the protocols without a TTP but without the prior drawbacks of the previous solutions without a TTP.

However, the specific-shape priors about anomalous subgraphs of interest are seldom considered by the traditional approaches when detecting the subgraphs in attributed graphs (e.g., computer networks, Bitcoin networks, and etc.). This paper proposes a nonlinear approach to specific-shape graph anomaly detection. The nonlinear approach focuses on optimizing a broad class of nonlinear cost functions via specific-shape constraints in attributed graphs. Our approach can be used to many different graph anomaly settings. The traditional approaches can only support linear cost functions (e.g., an aggregation function for the summation of node weights).

Cryptocurrencies are also independent from the macroeconomic environment and cannot be explained by a standard asset pricing model. A cryptocurrency specific model yields clearly better results. In addition, the whole cryptocurrency space is dominated by only a few individual digital coins.

The contribution of this paper is to propose a split-and-transfer flow model for entropic centrality, where at every node, the flow can actually be arbitrarily split across choices of neighbours.

The security of bitcoin blockchain hugely depends on the complexity and reliability of the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus. However, a non-financial application, whose security requirements are less demanding, requires faster operation and so PoW is not suitable for many of the commercial applications. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Trust-dependent Consensus scheme (TCON) for a blockchain based IoT access control framework. TCON ensures that the blocks are added at a faster rate, spending minimal energy compared to PoW based systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the notion of trust is quantified and used as a means to simplify the consensus problem in blockchain. A comparison of the various metrics to understand the differences in overhead involved suggest that the proposed scheme outperforms other non-trust-based consensus schemes.","[Prabhakar, Anjana; Anjali, Tricha] IIIT B, Bangalore, Karnataka, India","","Prabhakar, A (corresponding author), IIIT B, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.","anjana.prabhakar@iiitb.org; tricha@iiitb.ac.in","Prabhakar, Anjana/AAC-1626-2020","Prabhakar, Anjana/0000-0001-8412-2088","Digital India Corporation","Digital India Corporation","The authors would like to thank Digital India Corporation promoted by the Ministry of Electronics and information Technology (MeitY), Govt. of India, for funding this research under the Visvesvaraya PhD scheme.","","10","5","5","0","6","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2155-2487","","978-1-5386-7902-9","INT CONF COMMUN SYST","","","2019","","","","","","","19","24","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BM8UI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000470001000004","View Full Record in Web of Science"

After Bitcoin became popular, new usage areas of Blockchain was started to being investigating because of the advantage of the technology such as security, agentless transaction, and transparency. HAVELSAN is a large scale software company, investigates on new generation technologies and works on to adapt it. In this manner, Blockchain is one of these new generation technologies that brings impressive advantages. Blockchain is a decentralized transactional database technology in which all transactions are encrypted on blocks, allowing the buyer and seller to make a secure exchange between themselves directly. In this transactional database technology, all transactions are recorded in a structure called Distributed (Open) Ledger, where transactions are held and open to all users. In the traditional approach (central database), when the database is controlled by a third party, the copy of the database in the Blockchain approach is available to all participants. This prevents the data from being corrupted and destroyed. In order to be able to modify this distributed structure, the relevant changes must be recorded on all computers in the system. The success of any type of cyber attack becomes impossible because of the necessity of accepting changes in the vast majority of the network. Smart Contract is a key concept of Blockchain in order to gather all these advantages. Smart Contracts not only define the rules and penalties around an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does, but also automatically enforce those obligations. HAVELSAN is a large scale software company that has wide range of operation field, so there could be different applications of Blockchain with regard to company operation fields. Combining this variety with the importance of Smart Contract concept, which could be counted as the basis for most Blockchain applications, it is beneficial to establish a strong based Smart Contract frame before starting to build our own applications with Blockchain. Therefore, we aimed to build our customized Smart Contract structure before developing miscellaneous applications. In this article, HAVELSAN Blockchain Smart Contract framework establishment; which infrastructures were used, the problems encountered during the development and the most applicable way of use this framework will be explained.","[Mendi, Arif Furkan; Erol, Tolga; Safak, Emre; Kayin, Tolga] HAVELSAN AS, R&D, Technol & Prod Management Dept, Ankara, Turkey","Havelsan AS","Mendi, AF (corresponding author), HAVELSAN AS, R&D, Technol & Prod Management Dept, Ankara, Turkey.","afmendi@havelsan.com.tr; terol@havelsan.com.tr; esafak@havelsan.com.tr; tkayin@havelsan.com.tr","","","","","","","11","0","0","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2472-4386","","978-1-7281-1244-2","INT SYM NETWO COMP","","","2019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering","BO6JH","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000520478600102","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this paper, we introduce EQREL, a specialized parallel union-find data structure for scalable equivalence relations, and its integration into a Datalog compiler. Our data structure provides a quadratic worst-case speed-up and space improvement. We demonstrate the efficacy of our data structure in SOUFFLE, which is a Datalog compiler that synthesizes parallel C++ code.

The authors study the civil and criminal law aspects of this phenomenon. The legislation does not define the legal status of cryptocurrencies, while the theory of law and court practice have not yet worked out a unified approach to it. The authors present an overview of the existing positions regarding this issue and suggest that cryptocurrency should be regarded as other property. It is stated that whatever position is incorporated into law, in real life cryptocurrency is in global circulation and has a great potential. As for criminal law, the authors show that it is relatively independent from civil law when dealing with issues within its object. It is suggested that, for the purposes of criminal law, the available instruments should be adjusted to enable a prompt reaction to the crimes committed at the present moment. The authors analyze the possibility of recognizing cryptocurrencies as an object and instrument of committing crimes within the framework of current legislation. Using the examples different crimes, the authors demonstrate that cryptocurrency could act as an instrument of committing them. It is also stated that cryptocurrency could be recognized as an object of some crimes. To support their position, the authors present such arguments as crimes of terrorism, illegal trade in drugs and psychoactive substances, economic crimes and some others. They also discuss cryptocurrency as an object of theft. It is proven that there is a practical necessity to recognize cryptocurrency as an object of theft. Criticism of this approach by some researchers is also discussed. The authors, however, show that it is possible to solve this problem positively. They conclude that current Russian and foreign legislation should be amended and should define the legal status of cryptocurrencies; however, the goal of criminal law could and should be achieved even before these amendments are adopted.","[Korennaya, Anna A.; Tydykova, Nadezhda V.] Altai State Univ, Barnaul, Russia","Altai State University","Korennaya, AA (corresponding author), Altai State Univ, Barnaul, Russia.","lawer_ann@mail.ru; academnauka@ram-bler.ru","","","","","","","22","1","1","1","7","BAIKAL STATE UNIV","IRKUTSK","11 LENIN ST, IRKUTSK, 664003, RUSSIA","2500-4255","2500-1442","","RUSS J CRIMINOL","Russ.

As the adoption of blockchain technologies by various sectors increases, there is a demand for tools that enable regulatory enforcement, which include monitoring, examining and ensuring compliance of the data stored by the blockchain systems, all in a privacy preserving way. Current blockchain solutions store transactions in append-only and immutable fashion without any indexing, which contributes to limited and inefficient queries. Additionally, there is no support for privacy-preserving query processing. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a system that can provide auditors, enforcing regulatory compliance, with efficient, scalable and richer blockchain query processing over Hadoop and synchronized Ethereum clients. The system additionally ensures auditors' privacy by utilizing cryptography techniques over semi-trusted servers to protect the auditors' identities, queries and their results.","[Linoy, Shlomi; Mandikhani, Hassan; Ray, Suprio; Lu, Rongxing; Stakhanova, Natalia; Ghorbani, Ali] Univ New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada","University of New Brunswick","Linoy, S (corresponding author), Univ New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada.","slinoy@unb.ca; hmahdikh@unb.ca; sray@unb.ca; rlu1@unb.ca; natalia.stakhanova@unb.ca; ghorbani@unb.ca","","","","","","","12","8","8","2","6","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-4693-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","398","404","","10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00061","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00061","","","7","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO8PX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000528931600052","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We have conducted an online study of eleven marketplaces residing within the darknet, addressing what kind of cyber attack items are available and where the profit lies. The results have been used to create a detailed categorization of items, showing a distribution based on item type and availability.

Although in this context a deep exploration of the Stock, Forex, and Future exchange markets has already been made, a more limited effort has been devoted to the application of machine learning techniques to the emerging cryptocurrency exchange market. This paper explores the potential of the most established classification and time series forecasting models in cryptocurrency trading by backtesting model performance over a eight year period. The results show that, due to the heterogeneity and volatility of the underlying financial instruments, prediction models based on series forecasting perform better than classification techniques. Furthermore, trading multiple cryptocurrencies at the same time significantly increases the overall returns compared to baseline strategies exclusively based on Bitcoin trading.","[Attanasio, Giuseppe; Cagliero, Luca; Garza, Paolo; Baralis, Elena] Politecn Torino, Turin, Italy","Polytechnic University of Turin","Attanasio, G (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Turin, Italy.","giuseppe.attanasio@polito.it; luca.cagliero@polito.it; paolo.garza@polito.it; elena.baralis@polito.it","","Cagliero, Luca/0000-0002-7185-5247","","","","","14","5","7","1","3","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","","978-1-4503-6823-0","","","","2019","","","","","","","","","","10.1145/3336499.3338003","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3336499.3338003","","","6","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS1OO","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000693942400001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In extensive application scenarios, conducting community detection over blockchain networks has potential effects on both discovering hidden information and enhancing communicating efficiency. However, the decentralised nature poses a restriction on community detection over blockchain networks. In coping with this restriction, we propose a distributed community detection method based on the Propose-Select-Adjust (PSA) framework that runs in an asynchronous way. We extend the PSA framework using the concept of structural entropy and aim to detect a community structure with low entropy. We test our entropy-based distributed community detection algorithm on both benchmark networks and bitcoin trust networks.

This article starts by introducing the basic concept of blockchain and illustrating why a consensus mechanism plays an indispensable role in a blockchain enabled IoT system. Then we discuss the main ideas of two famous consensus mechanisms, PoW and PoS, and list their limitations in IoT. Next, two mainstream DAG based consensus mechanisms, the Tangle and Hashgraph, are reviewed to show why DAG consensus is more suitable for IoT system than PoW and PoS.

Aggregate multisignature scheme is a combination of both aforementioned signature schemes, where signers can choose to generate either a multisignature or an aggregate signature. This combination scheme has many concrete application scenarios such as Bitcoin blockchain, Healthcare, Multicast Acknowledgment Aggregation, and so on. On the other hand, to deal with the problems of expensive certificates in certified public key cryptography and key escrow in identity-based cryptography, the notion of certificateless public key cryptography has been introduced by Riyami and Paterson at Asiacrypt'03. In this paper, we propose the first certificateless aggregate multisignature scheme that achieves the constant-size of signature and is secure in the standard model under a generalization of the Diffie-Hellman exponent assumption.

In order to successfully meet this use-case, cryptocurrencies combine various advanced information technologies (e.g., blockchain as a replicated database, asymmetrical ciphers and hashes guaranteeing integrity properties, peer-to-peer networking providing fault-tolerant service). Mining process not only introduces new cryptocurrency units, but it has become a business how to generate revenue in real life. This paper aims at different approaches how to detect cryptocurrency mining within corporate networks (where it should not be present). Mining activity is often a sign of malware presence or unauthorized exploitation of company resources.

Currently, the Lightning Network (LN) is the mainstream and most used payment channel network. In a previous work we introduced CLoTH, a payment channel network simulator we developed to analyze capabilities and limitations of such networks. In this work, using CLoTH, we present results of three groups of simulations on a recent snapshot of the LN, aimed to shed a light on the following aspects. Firstly, we investigated how hubs influence the LN performance. Then, we analyzed the effectiveness of two different channel rebalancing approaches, an active and a passive one. Eventually, we studied performance of the LN when a few service-providers nodes receive payments from the other network nodes, which is a typical use case of payment channel networks. We found that the LN is resilient to the removal of hubs, that our passive rebalancing approach reduces of about one fourth the payments failures due to channel unbalancing, and that in the service-providers scenario a consistent part of payments fails because channels directing to the service providers become unbalanced. Our work contributes to prove the strengthen of the Lightning Network when removing hubs and its weakness in the service-provider scenario. In addition, the passive rebalancing approach proposed in this work is a good candidate for the implementation in the Lightning Network protocol to mitigate channel unbalancing.","[Conoscenti, Marco; Vetro, Antonio; De Martin, Juan Carlos] Politecn Torino DAUIN, Nexa Ctr Internet & Soc, I-10129 Turin, Italy","Polytechnic University of Turin","Conoscenti, M (corresponding author), Politecn Torino DAUIN, Nexa Ctr Internet & Soc, I-10129 Turin, Italy.","marco.conoscenti@polito.it","Vetro', Antonio/P-7939-2018","Vetro', Antonio/0000-0003-2027-3308; De Martin, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-7867-1926","","","","","23","9","9","1","4","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2019","7","","","","","","132828","132840","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2941448","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2941448","","","13","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","JQ0HX","","gold, Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000498637200003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The General Agreement on Trade in Services ('GATS') as the only multilateral treaty that creates binding international obligations on the treatment to be accorded to service suppliers, including online services provides a solid foundational framework for services supplied by participants on blockchain, even if, unsurprisingly, several grey areas exist.

Due to its popularity and wide applications, enormous number of Blockchain systems have been proposed in the past few years. One way to understand the performance is to build a benchmarking tool to evaluate different systems under different scenarios. A few research teams have build their benchmarking tools, such as BLOCKBENCH and HFBench. Unfortunately, there are several limitations of these tools. In this paper, we enumerate these limitations and challenges. We then present our tool Boston Blockchain Benchmarking (BBB), which is more configurable and extensible than prior benchmarking tools. Moreover, BBB allows us to evaluate the impact of some common attacks against Blockchains. Finally, we present some preliminary results using BBB.","[Duan, Xuheng; Pan, Haochen; Tseng, Lewis; Wu, Yingjian] Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA","Boston College","Duan, XH (corresponding author), Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.","duanxu@bc.edu; haochen.pan@bc.edu; lewis.tseng@bc.edu; wuit@bc.edu","","","","","","","7","3","3","1","4","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","1555-094X","","978-1-7281-4961-5","IEEE PAC RIM INT SYM","","","2019","","","","","","","61","62","","10.1109/PRDC47002.2019.00026","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PRDC47002.2019.00026","","","2","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BO9CC","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000530687800015","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this paper, a design for a blockchain-based system, namely UniChain, for managing Electronic Academic Records (EARs) is proposed. UniChain is designed to improve the current management systems as it provides interoperable, secure, and effective access to EARs by students, universities, and other third parties, while keeping the students' privacy. UniChain employs timed-based smart contracts for governing transactions and controlling access to EARs. It adopts advanced encryption techniques for providing further security. This work proposes a new incentive mechanism that leverages the degree of universities regarding their efforts on maintaining academic records and creating new blocks. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the UniChain performance, and the results indicate the efficiency of the proposal in handling a large dataset at low latency.","[Daraghmi, Eman-Yasser] Palestine Tech Univ Kadoori, Coll Appl Sci, Dept Appl Comp, POB 7, Tulkarm, Palestine; [Daraghmi, Yousef-Awwad] Palestine Tech Univ Kadoori, Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Syst Engn, POB 7, Tulkarm, Palestine; [Yuan, Shyan-Ming] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan","National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University","Daraghmi, EY (corresponding author), Palestine Tech Univ Kadoori, Coll Appl Sci, Dept Appl Comp, POB 7, Tulkarm, Palestine.;Yuan, SM (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.","e.daraghmi@ptuk.edu.ps; y.awwad@ptuk.edu.ps; smyuan@cs.nctu.edu.tw","Daraghmi, Yousef-Awwad/J-8872-2018; Yuan, Shyan-Ming/O-1809-2013","Daraghmi, Yousef-Awwad/0000-0001-9126-376X; Yuan, Shyan-Ming/0000-0002-3621-9528; daraghmi, eman/0000-0001-8986-4232","Palestine Technical University-Kadoori; Bank of Palestine; Taawon association","Palestine Technical University-Kadoori; Bank of Palestine; Taawon association","We thank Palestine Technical University-Kadoori, Bank of Palestine, and Taawon association for their support.","","24","12","12","2","33","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2076-3417","","APPL SCI-BASEL","Appl.

Design/methodology/approach This paper is a theoretical paper that discusses cryptocurrencies and their role in the money laundering process. Findings Cryptocurrencies eliminate the need for intermediary financial institutions and allow direct peer-to-peer financial transactions. Because of the anonymity introduced through blockchain, cryptocurrencies have been favored by the darknet and other criminal networks. Originality/value Cryptocurrencies are a nascent form of money that first arose with the creation of bitcoin in 2009. This form of purely digital currency was meant as a direct competitor to government-backed fiat currency that are controlled by the central banking system.

However, Blockchain technology is more universal and can be used also in other areas, for example, in IoT, WSN and mobile devices. This paper considers the implementation of Blockchain technology in sensor networks as an element of IoT. The concept of Rolling Blockchain was proposed, which can be used to build WSN with the participation of Smart Cars, as nodes of the network. The order of block formation and structure in the chain is proposed and a mathematical model is created for it.

Unlike mainstream financial services applications, cryptocurrency wallets are not subject to the same stringent security requirements of their regulated counterparts. In this paper, we examine the security profiles of commonly used Android cryptocurrency applications. We examine these applications for common vulnerabilities outlined by OWASP mobile top 10. We establish a baseline for our tests by evaluating commonly used banking and trading applications. We compare the results from our baseline test and establish the state of security provided by cryptocurrency wallet applications. The paper also examines the possible privacy implications of mobile applications.

Existing methods show pros and cons but none of them showed a proper balance between the imbalance of wealth and the security of the ledgers. In proof of sincerity, by allowing each and every entity even with smaller computing power to get rewarded by mining, we can effectively prevent the extreme imbalance of the wealth (often caused by the mining that is dominated by a small number of huge resource owners). At the same time, by maintaining the appropriate level of sincerity in terms of the combination of the number of miners and the level of each mining work, we can effectively maintain the security level of the distributed ledgers.","[Zaman, Miraz Uz; Shen, Tong; Min, Manki] Louisiana Tech Univ, Comp Sci Program, Ruston, LA 71272 USA","University of Louisiana System; Louisiana Technical University","Zaman, MU (corresponding author), Louisiana Tech Univ, Comp Sci Program, Ruston, LA 71272 USA.","muz001@latech.edu; tsh037@latech.edu; mankimin@latech.edu","","","","","","","12","5","5","0","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2331-9852","","978-1-5386-5553-5","CONSUM COMM NETWORK","","","2019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BM4AG","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000462927900072","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Accompanied by the price volatility of bitcoins from 2017 to 2018, blockchain has been a hot word on the internet, and particularly hot in China. Blockchain offers a distributed and secure system for data storage and value transactions. Its applications are springing up in multiple fields. The Chinese government is considering these trends with great caution. Initial coin offering has been banned in China since September 2017. By contrast, an official white paper on China's blockchain technology, which was released in May 2018, said that blockchain technology will be widely applied in the real economy of China within 3 years. In a recent panel discussion held by National Science Review, experts talked about related topics. Their opinions may provide a quick view of the future development of blockchain in China and abroad.","","","","","","","","","","","0","12","12","3","39","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","2095-5138","2053-714X","","NATL SCI REV","Natl.

For the contagion effect, we utilized adaptations of Forbes and Rigobon's (2002) (FR) test, and FR test extensions based on the comoments of Fry, Martin, and Tang (2010) and Fry-McKibbin and Hsiao (2018). The results of using the CSSD test and Hwang and Salmon's (2004) state space model revealed herding behavior, demonstrating extreme periods of adverse herd behavior.

However, protocols with full smart contract-based security are either limited in functionality or complex, with high costs for secured interactions. This observation leads to the development of protocol-specific schemes to avoid costly dispute resolution in case all participants remain honest. In this paper, we introduce SmartJudge, an extensible generalization of this trend for smart contract-based two-party protocols. SmartJudge relies on a protocol-independent mediator smart contract that moderates two-party interactions and only consults protocol-specific verifier smart contracts in case of a dispute. This way, SmartJudge avoids verification costs in absence of disputes and sustains interaction confidentiality among honest parties.

In the past decade, the blockchain technology has evolved and became viable for various applications beyond the domain of finance. However, due to the complexity of blockchain technology, it is usually difficult and costly for most developers or teams to build, maintain and monitor a blockchain network that supports their applications. Most common developers or teams are unable to ensure the reliability and security of the blockchain system, which to a certain extent affects the quality of their applications. In this paper, we develop a BaaS platform called NutBaaS, which provides blockchain service over cloud computing environments, such as network deployment and system monitoring, smart contracts analysis and testing. Based on these services, developers can focus on the business code to explore how to apply blockchain technology more appropriately to their business scenarios, without bothering to maintain and monitor the system.","[Zheng, Weilin; Zheng, Zibin; Chen, Xiangping] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Weilin; Zheng, Zibin; Chen, Xiangping] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Key Lab Big Data Anal & Simulat Publ Op, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Dai, Kemian; Li, Peishan; Chen, Renfei] Badou Financial Blockchain Technol Co Ltd, Dept Blockchain Dev, Guangzhou 510600, Peoples R China","Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University","Zheng, ZB (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.;Zheng, ZB (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Key Lab Big Data Anal & Simulat Publ Op, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.","zhzibin@mail.sysu.edu.cn","Zheng, Zibin/E-3024-2014; Zheng, Zibin/HCH-2408-2022","Zheng, Zibin/0000-0002-7878-4330; Zheng, Zibin/0000-0002-7878-4330","National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFB1000101]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61722214, U1811462]; Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme; Pearl River S&T Nova Program of Guangzhou [201710010046]","National Key Research and Development Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme; Pearl River S&T Nova Program of Guangzhou","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program under Grant 2016YFB1000101, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61722214 and Grant U1811462, in part by the Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme, in 2016, and in part by the Pearl River S&T Nova Program of Guangzhou under Grant 201710010046.","","40","42","42","4","21","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2019","7","","","","","","134422","134433","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2941905","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2941905","","","12","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","NG4LH","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000563954900026","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Blockchains have been proposed as a promising solution for supporting Electronic Health Records (EHRs), but have also been linked to scalability concerns about supporting real-world healthcare systems. This paper quantifies the scalability issues and bottlenecks related to current blockchains and puts into perspective the limitations blockchains have with supporting healthcare systems. Particularly we show that well known blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and IOTA cannot support transactions of a large scale hospital system such as the University of Kentucky HealthCare system and leave over 7.5M unsealed transactions per day. We then discuss how bottlenecks of blockchains can be relieved with sidechains, enabling well-known blockchains to support even larger hospital systems of over 30M transactions per day. We then introduce the Patient-Healthchain architecture to provide future direction on how scaling blockchains for EHR systems with sidechains can be achieved.","[Donawa, Alyssa; Baker, Corey E.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Comp Sci, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Orukari, Inema] Washington Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","University of Kentucky; Washington University (WUSTL)","Donawa, A (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Comp Sci, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.","adonawa@uky.edu; inema.orukari@wustl.edu; baker@cs.uky.edu","","Baker, Corey/0000-0003-4803-2530","","","","","35","10","10","0","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-3885-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","550","556","","","","","","7","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BR4QI","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000652198600086","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The proposed Smart Stamp Duty offers significant improvements on the convenience when paying stamp duty by removing the need of physical revenue stamp. At the same time, the blockchain technology also provides the auditability of the recorded data. Smart stamp duty enables the expansion of the existing electronic stamp duty application to retail level.

Anonymous cryptocurrencies are highly essential since users need to preserve their privacy when conducting transactions. However, some users might misbehave with the cover of anonymity such as rampant trafficking or extortion. Thus, it is important to balance anonymity and accountability of anonymous cryptocurrencies. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a linkable group signature for signing cryptocurrency transactions, which can be used to trace a payer's identity in consortium blockchain based anonymous cryptocurrencies, in case a payer misbehaves in the system. The anonymity can be retained if a user behaves honestly. We prove that the proposed scheme achieves full-anonymity, full-traceability and linkability in the random oracle model. Implementation of the proposed linkable group signature scheme demonstrates its high efficiency and thus, can be adopted in anonymous cryptocurrencies in reality. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This centralization makes the financial system vulnerable to cyber-attacks. A natural way to make the financial system more robust and less vulnerable is to switch to decentralized currencies. Such a transition will also make financial system more transparent. Historically first currency of this type - bitcoin - use a large amount of electric energy to mine new coins and is, thus, not scalable to the level of financial system as a whole. A more realistic and less energy-consuming scheme is provided by proof-of-stake currencies, where the right to mint a new coin is assigned to a randomly selected user, with probability depending of the user's stake (e.g., his/her number of coins). What probabilities should we choose? In this paper, we find the probability selection that provides the optimal result - optimal in the sense that it is the least inductive to cheating.","[Nguyen Ngoc Thach] Banking Univ Ho Chi Minh City, Inst Banking Res & Technol, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Servin, Christian] El Paso Community Coll, El Paso, TX USA; [Kreinovich, Vladik] Univ Texas El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968 USA","Banking University Ho Chi Minh City; University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso","Kreinovich, V (corresponding author), Univ Texas El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.","Thachnn@buh.edu.vn; cservin@gmail.com; vladik@utep.edu","","","US National Science Foundation [HRD-1242122]","US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work was supported in part by the US National Science Foundation via grant HRD-1242122 (Cyber-ShARE Center of Excellence).","","5","0","0","0","3","CHIANG MAI UNIV, FAC SCIENCE","CHIANG MAI","239 HUAY KAEW RD, T SUTHEP, CHIANG MAI, 50200, THAILAND","1686-0209","","","THAI J MATH","Thai J.

Using some biased physical quantities that are observable in sites, we can make the scale-free network through processes of cooperating distributed sites. Each node only proposes connecting to the more attractive node among randomly known nodes. The candidate node that is found by each node agrees to set two-way links if the requesting node is more attractive than the old node that is already connected. Once they establish the new bidirectional relationship, they, respectively, remove the outgoing link to the less attractive node. We analytically calculate the connectivity distribution and show that the scaling exponent is 2.5.

Implementation of the consensus algorithm depends on the nature of targeted business environment. In this research, the performance of two consensus algorithms, Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Collatz Conjecture (PCC), are studied in the context of a private blockchain. A quantitative analysis on the execution time, deployment time, and latency time are done for 1, 10, 100, 1000, and 10000 transactions and the results are presented. The results shows that PCC takes only (1/1000)th of the execution time that is required for PoW for these different sets of transactions.

In order to reduce the reward variance, the miners join mining pools where the miners aggregate their computational resources and divide the reward according to their contributions, measured by shares. The miner-based attacks such as Block Withholding (BWH) and Fork After Withholding (FAW) yield unfair reward advantages to the attackers at the expense of the other honest miners by having the attackers withhold blocks while still submitting the shares and pretending to contribute to the victim pool. This paper introduces Anti-Withholding Reward System (AWRS) to prevent FAW and BWH attacks. Implemented at the pool manager (reducing the adoption overhead and supporting backward-compatibility), AWRS deprives the incentive for FAW and BWH attacks by providing greater rewards to the block submissions. AWRS completely disincentivizes the FAW attack and reduces the optimal attacker's behavior to honest mining, making the withholding-based threats irrelevant for rational miners.","[Sarker, Arijet; Wuthier, Simeon; Chang, Sang-Yoon] Univ Colorado Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, CO 80918 USA","University of Colorado System; University of Colorado at Colorado Springs","Sarker, A (corresponding author), Univ Colorado Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, CO 80918 USA.","asarker@uccs.edu; swuthier@uccs.edu; schang2@uccs.edu","","Wuthier, Simeon/0000-0003-4088-7518","","","","","13","6","6","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-3669-1","","","","2019","","","","","","","43","46","","10.1109/CVCBT.2019.00004","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CVCBT.2019.00004","","","4","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO1JH","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000500473100006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A Stratum mining proxy connects to an upstream mining pool server and to downstream miners through TCP/IP connections. The proxy receives periodic jobs from the pool and broadcasts them to the miners. The broadcast operation becomes a performance and scalability bottleneck when the number of miners increases significantly. In this paper, we propose a hardware/software co-designed architecture for the proxy to accelerate the broadcast of periodic jobs. We customize the Stratum protocol with a layer 2 broadcast mechanism instead of using TCP/IP connections. The proposed architecture is implemented on a Xilinx Zynq SoC (ARM processor and FPGA) board where the layer 2 broadcast mechanism is offloaded on the FPGA.

However, it is facing serious security threats due to its distributed structure with a center. Blockchain has received extensive attention due to its decentralized, secure and trusted characteristics since the existence of Bitcoin. In this paper, we propose a new domain name system based on blockchain techniques called SSHTDNS. The form of consortium chain is adopted in SSHTDNS to guarantee the management of Top-Level Domain names, and linkable ring signature technique is used for identity anonymity and voting fairness of these consortium nodes.

There are continuous arguments at which features from Bitcoin are fundamental for blockchains and what are changeable. Furthermore, a devoted credit system is required to make blockchain systems creditworthy although blockchains provide a creditworthy infrastructure for data-level storage and operations. The necessity, feasibility, efficiency, and expected benefits are crucial factors to evaluate a blockchain venture. Several popular and promising blockchain techniques are underdeveloped; among them are those for blockchain creditworthiness, performance, efficiency, security, privacy, supervision, and online-to-offline integration.

For this purpose, a comprehensive framework of use case clusters of BCT in SCM is developed according to the distinctive features of BCT. The framework is used to analyze 53 applications of BCT in SCM which are derived from a systematic literature review and a secondary dataset of blockchain-driven innovations in SCM.

Many blockchain advocates claim that these software artefacts enable radically new forms of decentralised governance by relying upon computational trust created via cryptographic proof, obviating the need for reliance on conventional trusted third-party intermediaries. But these claims rest on some key assumptions, which this paper subjects to critical examination. It asks: can existing mechanisms and procedures for collective decision-making of public blockchains (which we refer to as internal blockchain governance) live up to these ambitions? By drawing upon HLA Hart's Concept of Law, together with literature from regulatory governance studies, we argue that unless public blockchain systems establish formal and effective internal governance, they are unlikely to be taken up at scale as a tool for social coordination, and are thus likely to remain, at best, a marginal technology.","[Yeung, Karen] Univ Birmingham, Law Sch, Law Eth & Informat, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Yeung, Karen] Univ Birmingham, Sch Comp Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Yeung, Karen] Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Galindo, David] Univ Birmingham, Sch Comp Sci, Comp Secur, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Galindo, David] Fetch AI, Cryptog, Cambridge, England","University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham; University of Melbourne; University of Birmingham","Galindo, D (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Comp Sci, Comp Secur, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.;Galindo, D (corresponding author), Fetch AI, Cryptog, Cambridge, England.","d.galindo@cs.bham.ac.uk","","Galindo, David/0000-0003-3563-5551","Wellcome Trust [210337/Z/18/Z]; EPSRC [EP/R007128/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Wellcome Trust(Wellcome TrustEuropean Commission); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","Interdisciplinary Professorial Fellow in Law, Ethics and Informatics, Law School and School of Computer Science, the University of Birmingham, UK, and Distinguished Visiting Fellow atMelbourne Law School, Melbourne, Australia.

This immutability, however, presents disadvantages for the blockchain technology, when it is used in other areas where the modification of data in blockchain is demanded. In this study, we propose a method for building modifiable blockchains in decentralized public network. To be specific, in computing the hash value of the block, the proposed method uses truncated hash values (these are called 'target values' in this paper) of the transactions that are modifiable upon future requests, instead of transactions themselves. By doing so, the proposed method provides an opportunity to modify those transactions by making truncated hash values of modified versions equal to their original target values. The proposed method uses several cryptographic techniques to prevent the modification of the transaction from being performed for malicious purposes, and a multichain structure to improve the efficiency in transaction modification. By accommodating the modification feature to the blockchain, proposed architecture complies to key demands of the data protection regulations such as 'right to rectification', 'right to withdraw consent', and 'right to be forgotten', et cetera. In addition, detailed threat analysis demonstrates that the proposed truncated hash-based modification is sufficiently secure to open up a wide range of new blockchain based services through added modifiability feature.","[Lee, Nam-Yong] Inje Univ, Dept Appl Math, Gimhae 50834, South Korea; [Lee, Nam-Yong; Onik, Mehedi Hassan; Kim, Chul-Soo] Inje Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Gimhae 50834, South Korea; [Yang, Jinhong; Kim, Chul-Soo] Inje Univ, Dept Healthcare & Informat Technol, Gimhae 50834, South Korea","Inje University; Inje University; Inje University","Lee, NY (corresponding author), Inje Univ, Dept Appl Math, Gimhae 50834, South Korea.;Lee, NY (corresponding author), Inje Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Gimhae 50834, South Korea.;Yang, JH (corresponding author), Inje Univ, Dept Healthcare & Informat Technol, Gimhae 50834, South Korea.","nylee@inje.ac.kr; jinhong@inje.ac.kr","Onik, Mehedi Hassan/AAR-1180-2020","Onik, Mehedi Hassan/0000-0003-3800-3058","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation; Korea Government, Ministry of Science and ICT [2019-0-00250]","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation; Korea Government, Ministry of Science and ICT","This work was supported in part by the Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation, and in part by the Korea Government, Ministry of Science and ICT, through the Development of Decentralized Blockchains With Modifiable Transactions, under Grant 2019-0-00250.","","40","15","15","4","13","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2019","7","","","","","","173571","173582","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2956628","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2956628","","","12","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","KF6TW","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000509374200179","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, because of the limited throughput, current blockchain platforms can not meet the transaction demand in practical use. Though researchers proposed many new solutions, they suffered either decentralization or security issues. In this paper, using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, we improve the linear structure of traditional blockchain protocol. In the new structure, blocks are organized in levels and width, which will generate into a compacted DAG structure (CoDAG). To make CoDAG more efficient and secure, we design algorithms and protocols to place the new-generated blocks appropriately. Compared with traditional blockchain protocols, CoDAG improves the security and transaction verification time, and enjoys the consistency and liveness properties of blockchain. Taking adversary parties into consideration, two possible attack strategies are presented in this paper, and we further prove that CoDAG is a secure and robust protocol to resist them. The experimental results show that CoDAG can achieve 394 transactions per second, which is 56 times of Bitcoin's throughput and 26 times of Ethereum's.","[Yang, Shu; Chen, Ziteng; Cui, Laizhong] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Software Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Xu, Mingwei; Ming, Zhongxing; Xu, Ke] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China","Shenzhen University; Tsinghua University","Cui, LZ (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Software Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.","yang.shu@szu.edu.cn; chenziteng1996@gmail.com; cuilz@szu.edu.cn; xmw@cernet.edu.cn; mzx@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn; xuke@tsinghua.edu.cn","Cui, Laizhong/AAX-9571-2020; Ming, Zhongxing/AAC-4048-2020","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61772345]; National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data System Computing Technology","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data System Computing Technology","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61772345) and National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data System Computing Technology.","","10","11","11","0","10","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-4693-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","314","318","","10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00049","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00049","","","5","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO8PX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000528931600040","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Managing DoS attacks is even harder in peer-to-peer projects because of multiple equal in rights nodes (miners or maintainers) that communicate across the globe to secure the network. In most blockchains, users can send transactions. Moreover, as a systems throughput is limited, the ability to send transactions should be limited in some honest and transparent way. Otherwise, the pool of unconfirmed (pending) transactions mempool could be overloaded, and it may cause DoS. In Bitcoin, users pay a fee for each transaction to address this issue. Steem.io introduced an alternative approach based on the fractional reservation of the blockchain block space. This approach is an adaptation of similar ones from the network routing and banking systems. The block space fractional reservation for blockchains in terms of a score function is introduced in this paper. Authors made a private blockchain project demo on Exonum framework.

We solve this problem for multimedia data by augmenting a blockchain on-chain smart contract between the sender and receiver with an off-chain cryptographic protocol, such that any significant data breach from the receiver is penalized through a monetary loss. Towards achieving the goal, we use an oblivious transfer scheme when used with a robust watermarking and a claim-or-refund blockchain contract provides the necessary framework to realize the APB protocol in a provably secure manner. In our APB protocol, a public data breach by the receiver leads to her Bitcoin (or other blockchain) private signing key getting revealed to the sender, which allows him to penalize the receiver by claiming the deposit from the claim-or-refund contract. Interestingly, the protocol also ensures that the malicious sender cannot steal the deposit, even as he knows the original multimedia document or releases it in any form.","[Mangipudi, Easwar Vivek; Kate, Aniket] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Rao, Krutarth] Hewlett Packard Corp, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Clark, Jeremy] Concordia Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Hewlett-Packard; Concordia University - Canada","Mangipudi, EV (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.","emangipu@purdue.edu; raokrutarth@gmail.com; j.clark@concordia.ca; aniket@purdue.edu","","","","","","","21","2","2","0","4","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-3026-2","","","","2019","","","","","","","340","346","","10.1109/EuroSPW.2019.00044","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EuroSPW.2019.00044","","","7","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BN6IW","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000485315600038","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Thus, it is a key challenge to ensure that blockchain frameworks provide security, access control, and high performance to applications. In this paper, we evaluate two frameworks for blockchain development, Parity, and Multichain, which provide configuration and permission flexibility. Our evaluation is a comprehensive comparison between the frameworks, focusing on the analysis of transaction-validation time, transactionmining time, transaction-seek time and block-seek time. To this end, we deploy peer-to-peer private permissioned networks, in which the frameworks generate the blockchain applications. For each framework, we provide a realistic workload, based on the distribution of probability of interarrival time of transactions on the Bitcoin network. The results show that each framework stands out under specific criteria, and their design decisions imply restrictions on features that are critical for creating secure and efficient blockchain applications.","[Oliveira, Marcela T.; Carrara, Gabriel R.; Fernandes, Natalia C.; Albuquerque, Celio V.

While many people are making investments in Cryptocurrency, the dynamical features, uncertainty, the predictability of Cryptocurrency are still mostly unknown, which dramatically risk the investments. It is a matter to try to understand the factors that infiuence the value formation. In this study, we use advanced artificial intelligence frameworks of fully connected Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network to analyse the price dynamics of Bitcoin, Etherum, and Ripple. We find that ANN tends to rely more on long-term history while LSTM tends to rely more on short-term dynamics, which indicate the efficiency of LSTM to utilise useful information hidden in historical memory is stronger than ANN. However, given enough historical information ANN can achieve a similar accuracy, compared with LSTM. This study provides a unique demonstration that Cryptocurrency market price is predictable. However, the explanation of the predictability could vary depending on the nature of the involved machine-learning model.","[Wang Yiying] Univ Liverpool, Dept Math, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Zang Yeze] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","University of Liverpool; Beijing Jiaotong University","Wang, YY (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Dept Math, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.","y.wang304@student.liverpool.ac.uk; 16311038@bjtu.edu.cn","","","","","","","10","11","11","1","10","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-3430-7","","","","2019","","","","","","","97","101","","","","","","5","Engineering, Industrial; Operations Research & Management Science","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science","BN1OI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000474735200017","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The concept has proven its utility in the practice of IT management, but EA frameworks cannot deal with network organizations that are enabled by IT. EA frameworks assume a hierarchically coordinated organization, where final responsibility for strategy rests with management. The characteristic feature of network organizations is that there is no central coordinator with final responsibility. Yet, today's network organizations are facilitated by IT and they too must be aligned with their IT infrastructure. To align networked organizations, we must take the value viewpoint, which is absent in EA. This paper presents an approach to business-IT alignment for networked organizations based on the concept of networked value models. In addition, since there is no hierarchical management in a network, we view business-IT alignment in a network as a coordination game, and we include results from coordination theory and game theory in our approach. We illustrate our approach with an example from the electricity business and apply it to the Bitcoin network.","[Wieringa, R. J.; Ionita, D.] Univ Twente, Enschede, Netherlands; [Wieringa, R.

In many of the systems we use today, financial rewards and punishments provide a key incentive to participate and abide by the rules. From salaries to traffic tickets, financial motives are often closely tied to a system's viability. Distributed systems such as blockchain also need a mechanism to motivate good behavior. A blockchain must encourage users to maintain the system while preventing a minority of these users from colluding and gaining disproportionate control. Many popular public blockchains use monetary incentives to encourage users to participate and behave appropriately. But these same incentive schemes create more problems than they solve. Mining rewards cause centralization in proof of work chains such as Bitcoin. Validator rewards and punishments invite attacks in proof of stake chains. This paper argues why these incentive schemes are detrimental to blockchain. It also considers a range of other systems-some of which incorporate monetary incentives, some of which do not-to confirm that monetary incentives may be neither necessary nor sufficient for good user behavior.","[Ketsdever, Shea; Fischer, Michael J.] Yale Univ, Dept Comp Sci, POB 2158, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Yale University","Ketsdever, S (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Comp Sci, POB 2158, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.","shea.ketsdever@aya.yale.edu; michael.fischer@yale.edu","","","","","","","17","1","1","1","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-3885-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","873","876","","","","","","4","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BR4QI","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000652198600136","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This paper proposes a TPS(Transaction Per Second) model that can validly describe the PoW-based block-generating method and constructs a simulation experiment. Besides, actual data does not reach the peak of TPS, we assume that each block is full of transactions and get a set of fixed data. By comparing the fixed data, it can be found that when the block size is 1MB, the average relative error between the experimental results and the fixed TPS is 13.00%. The average relative error between the calculated results and the fixed values is 16.90%. When the block size is 4 MB, it is 14.93% and 15.25% respectively.

The processes of generating addresses, signing transactions, and checking the balance are parts of the cryptocurrency core processes. With these activities, the wallet application was created to assist and handle the execution of those processes. The private key plays the most important component to interact with assets inside cryptocurrency blockchain database. Without the private key, the asset in blockchain will not be managed or controlled, thus all cryptocurrency coins in correspondent wallet will be lost. This paper provides a solution to recovery cryptocurrency coin that lost according to inability to login to wallet application. The main component used to recover coins in this paper is the unspent transaction output.","[Rakdej, Pongpat; Lilakiatsakun, Woraphon] Mahanakorn Univ Technol, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, Bangkok, Thailand; [Janpitak, Nanta] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Engn Sriracha, Sri Racha Campus, Sri Racha, Chonburi, Thailand; [Warasart, Maykin] Digital Govt Dev Agcy Publ Org DGA, Digital Innovat Ctr, Bangkok, Thailand","Mahanakorn University of Technology","Rakdej, P (corresponding author), Mahanakorn Univ Technol, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, Bangkok, Thailand.","pongpat7997@gmail.com; njanpitak@gmail.com; maykin@owasp.org; woraphon@mut.ac.th","Warasart, Maykin/ABI-3386-2020","Warasart, Maykin/0000-0001-9855-1676","","","","","15","0","1","2","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-1019-6","","","","2019","","","","","","","99","103","","","","","","5","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP0JQ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000534587300019","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Determining the influential nodes is made with respect to information diffusion models. Most of the existing models only contain trust relationships while distrust exist in social networks as well. There exist some drawbacks in limited studies where distrust relationship is involved. The most outstanding drawback is the lack of assessment on the validity of the schemes presented on how influence propagates through distrust relationships in comparison with real word propagation in social networks. In this paper, two schemes are proposed, where based on each, some new models are proposed in two classes: cascade-based and threshold-based. All models of concern here are evaluated in comparison with the benchmark models through two real data sets, the Epinions and Bitcoin OTC. Results obtained indicate the superiority of one of the proposed schemes: when a distrusted user performs an action or adopts an opinion, the target users may tend not to do it.

And just like that, we don't really have to understand the technology behind it and be knowledge of its importance. But what makes this innovation revolution a bigger deal than Bitcoin and possibly even the Internet itself, are the exponential opportunities the concept provides. However, the potential to integrated Blockchain to Internet of Things (IoT) has constraint due to the required high computational power. IoT comprises of numerous platforms which have limited performance. Usually, these platforms cannot handle intensive procedures and often has scalability issues. In this paper, we give an overview of consensus algorithms and the necessity of this method to blockchain technology.

This article attempts to bring solutions to support small farmers in allowing them to use irrigation systems. It proposes to create associations of small farmers to manage this situation. For this purpose, it is proposed to use green energy using photovoltaic panels. The efficiency of the proposed system will be monitored not only by the location and type of photovoltaic panels, but also by using the new blockchain technology that stimulates innovation and growth in the energy, climate and environment sectors.

To maintain a distributed ledger in many independent peer nodes without central authority, the consensus mechanism is the key protocol to construct a blockchain system with multiple technologies. However compared to the well-studied consensus protocols in public blockchain, the customized consensus mechanism is still lack of research for the consortium blockchain in both industry and academia, especially in the enterprise scenarios of applications and services. The layered consensus mechanism in the consortium blockchain is discussed after considering and combining the common characteristics of enterprise applications and services. Based on the famous Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), the new layered and service-oriented consensus mechanism should be more practical to apply the blockchain technology to much diversified enterprise services with decentralization and extensibility in the principle of enterprise-level security.","[He, Sheng; Ning, Yishuang; Xing, Chunxiao] Beijing Natl Res Ctr Informat Sci & Technol, Res Inst Informat Technol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [He, Sheng; Ning, Yishuang; Xing, Chunxiao] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Inst Internet Ind, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [He, Sheng; Ning, Yishuang; Chen, Huan; Zhang, Liang-Jie] Natl Engn Res Ctr Supporting Software Enterprise, Shenzhen 518057, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [He, Sheng; Ning, Yishuang; Chen, Huan; Zhang, Liang-Jie] Kingdee Int Software Grp, Kingdee Res, Shenzhen 518057, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Tsinghua University","He, S (corresponding author), Beijing Natl Res Ctr Informat Sci & Technol, Res Inst Informat Technol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;He, S (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Inst Internet Ind, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;He, S (corresponding author), Natl Engn Res Ctr Supporting Software Enterprise, Shenzhen 518057, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;He, S (corresponding author), Kingdee Int Software Grp, Kingdee Res, Shenzhen 518057, Guangdong, Peoples R China.","heshengpku@gmail.com","","Xing, Chunxiao/0000-0001-9390-3097","NSFC [91646202]; 1000-Talent program;  [S-2018-164-503559];  [2017YFB0802703];  [JSGG20160331101809920]","NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 1000-Talent program; ; ; ","This work was partially supported by the technical projects No. S-2018-164-503559, No. 2017YFB0802703, and No. JSGG20160331101809920.

Based on the proposed solution, an experiment with 40 Home Nodes is conducted to prove the concepts. From the results, we find that our solution provides a high transaction speed and scalability, as well as good performance on security and micropayment which are important in IoT settings. Then, we conduct an analysis and discuss how the new system breaks out the well-known Trilemma, which claims that it is hard for a DLT platform to simultaneously reach decentralization, scalability and security.

To relieve from this situation, we present a secure versatile light payment (SVLP) scheme. The SVLP merely employs a digital signature algorithm and a one-way function and has similar security comparing to existing blockchain systems, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The proposed scheme is of ultra-low power consumption, since the payers and payees only need one-way functions to achieve multiple transactions, instead of the costly digital signature algorithms. Furthermore, the processes of payment and refunding are flexible. This is due to the fact that the denomination in our scheme possesses divisibility and the users need not to verify the preimages on the long chain one-byone. Finally, as the transaction can be taken off-chain and offline, it can be even used in remote areas or geological disasters areas where communication infrastructures are lacked or destroyed. All these features indicate that our scheme is practical and versatile. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the long confirmation time, and hence the slow finality rate, is far from satisfactory. Alternative paradigms with performance improvement emerge. Nevertheless, there are fewer attempts in modifying the PoW mechanism itself. We find that the slow finality rate in PoW is caused by using only one bit to measure the computational power, namely, whether the attained hash value is smaller than a given target. In this paper, we first propose Demo-of-Work (DoW), a generalized PoW which assigns the computational work with a score depending on the hash value. We also treat the bitcoin blockchain as a global clock to attain synchronization for ensuring that each participant takes part in DoW for roughly the same time interval for ensuring fairness. With these two tools, we construct an alternative blockchain called AB-chain which provides a significantly faster finality rate when compared with the existing PoW-based blockchains, without sacrificing communication complexity or fairness.","[Tang, Shuyang; Liu, Zhiqiang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chow, Sherman S.

It is not a priori clear what the aggregation period should be in case of continuously traded cryptocurrencies at online exchanges. In this work, we aggregate RV values using minute-sampled Bitcoin returns over 3-h intervals. Next, using the RV time series, we predict the future values based on the past samples using a plethora of machine learning methods, ANN (MLP, GRU, LSTM), SVM, and Ridge Regression, which are compared to the Heterogeneous Auto-Regressive Realized Volatility (HARRV) model with optimized lag parameters. It is shown that Ridge Regression performs the best, which supports the auto-regressive dynamics postulated by HARRV model. Mean Squared Error values by the neural-network based methods closely follow, whereas the SVM shows the worst performance.

Because it is a new phenomenon, there are few studies on blockchain, and those studies have focused mainly on the technology's potential impacts, whereas how to effectively implement it in an organization remains unknown. Our study intends to fill that gap. Using affordance-actualization (A-A) theory as the theoretical lens, we conducted a case study of blockchain implementation in an organization that has effectively implemented it. We identify three affordances of blockchain in the organization and a process model whereby these affordances are actualized. The process model extends A-A theory by adding an experimentation phase where blockchain's use cases within the organization are identified, developed and tested through conceptual adaptation and constraint mitigation. Our study makes important theoretical contributions to the literature on A-A theory, blockchain, information technology (IT) implementation, and strategic information systems (SIS). Our study can also help IT practitioners to implement blockchain effectively and extract value from their investment.","[Du, Wenyu (Derek); Ying, Wenchi] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Pan, Shan L.] Univ New South Wales, UNSW Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Leidner, Dorothy E.] Baylor Univ, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Leidner, Dorothy E.] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden","Beihang University; University of New South Wales Sydney; Baylor University; Lund University","Ying, WC (corresponding author), 37 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.","duwenyu@buaa.edu.cn; shan.pan@unsw.edu.au; Dorothy_Leidner@baylor.edu; yingwenchi@buaa.edu.cn","Pan, Shan L/M-6996-2017","","China's NSFC Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese Scholars and Scholars in Hong Kong and Macao [71529001]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71402187, 71402186]","China's NSFC Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese Scholars and Scholars in Hong Kong and Macao; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","Funding for this research was provided by China's NSFC Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese Scholars and Scholars in Hong Kong and Macao (71529001), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71402187, 71402186).","","72","83","83","25","167","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0963-8687","1873-1198","","J STRATEGIC INF SYST","J.

In recent years, this technology has attracted significant scientific interest in research areas beyond the financial sector, one of them being the Internet of Things (IoT). In this context, the blockchain is seen as the missing link toward building a truly decentralized, trustless, and secure environment for the IoT and, in this survey, we aim to shape a coherent and comprehensive picture of the current state-of-the-art efforts in this direction. We start with fundamental working principles of blockchains and how blockchain-based systems achieve the characteristics of decentralization, security, and auditability.

Blockchain has been proven to be a safe alternative to be used in mining systems because it allows a secure applicability in databases and also another important aspect is that each hash in a crypto mining system cannot be changed if it has such an algorithm behind its build. Thus, resulting in a secure and reliable system. The purpose of this paper aims to show how blockchain can affect and be used in a smart power management system going forth from the SealedGrid platform. This system enables the user to monitor in real time the power usage in a smart grid system, in so much that this platform is built to be secure and safe from third-party attacks.

However, the decentralization property also brings difficulties on privacy preserving and auditing. Although several approaches have been suggested to support anonymity, none of them has a reliable anonymity revocation mechanism. We fill this gap by presenting a novel e-cash scheme called traceable decentralized anonymous e-cash (TDAE). In TDAE, the transactions can be publicly verified, and the identities of the payers and payees are hidden from everyone except a designated authority. Moreover, we consider active attackers who can corrupt selected authorities along with many users within the e-cash system. We present rigorous security definitions for a TDAE scheme, ensuring that even an active attacker cannot spend more money than he owns, neither can he frame any user that is not corrupted. We also provide a secure generic construction of a TDAE scheme. This construction is built upon several basic cryptographic tools, and thus it enables one to obtain a TDAE with better security and efficiency when advantageous tools are available.","[Feng, Hanwen; Liu, Jianwei; Wu, Qianhong; Xu, Tongge] Beihang Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China","Beihang University","Xu, TG (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.","feng_hanwen@buaa.edu.cn; liujianwei@buaa.edu.cn; qianhong.wu@buaa.edu.cn; xutg@buaa.edu.cn","","Feng, Hanwen/0000-0002-7069-5165","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0802502]; foundation of Science and Technology on Information Assurance Laboratory [61421120305162112006]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61672083, 61532021, 61472429, 61402029, 61702028, 61571024]; ministry of education [12YJAZH136]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [4132056]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; foundation of Science and Technology on Information Assurance Laboratory; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); ministry of education; Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation)","This paper is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China through project 2017YFB0802502, by the foundation of Science and Technology on Information Assurance Laboratory through project 61421120305162112006, by the National Natural Science Foundation of China through projects 61672083, 61532021, 61472429, 61402029, 61702028 and 61571024, by the planning fund project of ministry of education through project 12YJAZH136, by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation through project 4132056.","","17","1","1","0","2","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-3024-8","","","","2019","","","","","","","344","349","","10.1109/DASC/PiCom/CBDCom/CyberSciTech.2019.00070","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DASC/PiCom/CBDCom/CyberSciTech.2019.00070","","","6","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BQ5ZW","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000609886700054","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Unlike UTXO-based Bitcoin, Ethereum, the account-based blockchain, requires real-time updates of the account balance. Therefore, its corresponding hidden operation has certain difficulties. We propose a privacy protection scheme called RZcash to solve this problem. It implements the hiding of account balances that are updated in real time, and uses rangeproofs to ensure that the amount of each transaction does not exceed the payer's existing balance. For hiding the payee, we improve the related technology of Monero by using the ciphertext equivalent commitment scheme. We also provide the conversion mechanism and trading method between hidden coins and open coins and describe how RZcash can be combined with an existing account-based blockchain system (such as Ethereum). Finally, we implement the core model of RZcash and evaluate its performance. The evaluation results show that the scheme not only guarantees the privacy and security of the blockchain, but also has good performance in practical applications.","[Bai, Xue; Wang, Licheng; Zhou, Lijing; Yang, Sijia; Li, Lixiang] BUPT, Beijing, Peoples R China","Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications","Bai, X (corresponding author), BUPT, Beijing, Peoples R China.","baixue1624@qq.com; wanglc2012@126.com; 379739494@qq.com; ysjhhh@gmail.com; lixiang@bupt.cn.com","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFB0800602]; Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program of China [2018CXGC0701]; 111 Project [B08004]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program of China; 111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project)","fig1.png This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2016YFB0800602, Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2018CXGC0701, and the 111 Project (No. B08004)","","15","0","0","1","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1712-364X","","978-1-7281-3265-5","ANN CONF PRIV SECUR","","","2019","","","","","","","28","36","","","","","","9","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP7DZ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000561703600004","View Full Record in Web of Science"

During this time, different DLT enthusiasts and commercial companies have proposed and developed several DLT platforms. These platforms are usually categorized as public vs private, general purpose vs application specific and so on. As a growing number of people are interested to build DLT applications, it is important to understand their underlying architecture and capabilities in order to determine which DLT platform should be leveraged for a specific DLT application. In addition, the platforms need to be evaluated and critically analyzed to assess their applicability, resiliency and sustainability in the long run. In this paper, we have surveyed several leading DLT platforms and evaluated their capabilities based on a number of quantitative and qualitative criteria. The comparative analysis presented in this paper will help the DLT developers and architects to choose the best platform as per their requirement(s).","[Chowdhury, Mohammad Jabed Morshed; Kayes, A.

The need for an official legislative definition of cryptocurrency attributes to the growth of transactions, cryptocurrencies trading at official marketplaces, and a change in the Russian government' sattitude towards cryptocurrencies from its banning to acceptance. One of the threats to the cryptocurrency turnover in financial markets was its imaginary anonymity -it has been generally accepted that cryptocurrency transactions are completely anonymous. However, all transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, and the key problem is to identify the account holder. Thus, it is not the account holder's identity that is anonymous, but rather an actual transaction.

A blockchain system implements a tamper-evident ledger for recording transactions that modify some global states. The system captures entire evolution history of the states. The management of that history, also known as data provenance or lineage, has been studied extensively in database systems. However, querying data history in existing blockchains can only be done by replaying all transactions. This approach is applicable to large-scale, offline analysis, but is not suitable for online transaction processing. We present LineageChain, a fine-grained, secure and efficient provenance system for blockchains. LineageChain exposes provenance information to smart contracts via simple and elegant interfaces, thereby enabling a new class of blockchain applications whose execution logics depend on provenance information at runtime. LineageChain captures provenance during contract execution, and efficiently stores it in a Merkle tree. LineageChain provides a novel skip list index designed for supporting efficient provenance query processing. We have implemented LineageChain on top of Hyperledger and a blockchain-optimized storage system called ForkBase. Our extensive evaluation of LineageChain demonstrates its benefits to the new class of blockchain applications, its efficient query, and its small storage overhead.","[Ruan, Pingcheng; Tien Tuan Anh Dinh; Lin, Qian; Ooi, Beng Chin] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Chen, Gang] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Meihui] Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China","National University of Singapore; Zhejiang University; Beijing Institute of Technology","Ruan, PC (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.","ruanpc@comp.nus.edu.sg; cg@zju.edu.cn; dinhtta@comp.nus.edu.sg; linqian@comp.nus.edu.sg; ooibc@comp.nus.edu.sg; meihui_zhang@bit.edu.cn","Dinh, Tien Tuan Anh/AAB-1363-2022; Lin, Qian/AAA-5851-2020","Dinh, Tien Tuan Anh/0000-0002-8158-3636; Lin, Qian/0000-0002-7665-601X","Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 3 under MOE's official grant [MOE2017-T3-1-007]","Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 3 under MOE's official grant(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","This research is supported by Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 3 under MOE's official grant number MOE2017-T3-1-007.","","34","49","58","4","16","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA","2150-8097","","","PROC VLDB ENDOW","Proc.

For the management of an accurate ledger, a strong limitation exists that requires a large amount of storage, and it binds the node specifications to force users to perform rational management on the network. These are designed into the system as invisible rules that are not described in the program. Therefore, monitoring the dynamism of nodes on the network can aid in understanding the potential system mechanisms. In this study, by monitoring Bitcoin and Ethereum over a long comparative period of 455 days as a system based on the main blockchains actually used, we demonstrate that it is difficult to balance the distributed structure owing to the rational behavior of users. We empirically provide the following evidence: (1) the node density of a specific hosting region increases; and (2) a local hosting region with less than 1% of the total nodes closes. We conclude that this is a security risk problem that results in a weak network structure, and discuss possible solutions.","[Imamura, Mitsuyoshi; Omote, Kazumasa] Univ Tsukuba, Tennodai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan; [Imamura, Mitsuyoshi] Nomura Asset Management Ltd, Chuo Ku, 1-11-1 Nihonbashi, Tokyo 1038260, Japan","University of Tsukuba","Imamura, M (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Tennodai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan.;Imamura, M (corresponding author), Nomura Asset Management Ltd, Chuo Ku, 1-11-1 Nihonbashi, Tokyo 1038260, Japan.","ic140tg528@gmail.com; omote@risk.tsukuba.ac.jp","","","","","","","16","2","2","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-36938-5; 978-3-030-36937-8","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2019","11928","","","","","","504","519","","10.1007/978-3-030-36938-5_31","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-36938-5_31","","","16","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Mathematics","BS4ZQ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000724601900031","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Today, blockchains do not only act as the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but have also been identified as a potentially disruptive technology in many different fields, e.g., supply chain tracking and healthcare. The widespread attention for blockchains has led to manifold research and development activities. As a result, today's blockchain landscape is heavily fragmented, with different, incompatible technologies being available to potential users. Since interoperability between different blockchains is usually not foreseen in existing protocols and standards, functionalities like sending tokens from one participant to another, or invoking and executing smart contracts can only be carried out within a single blockchain. In this paper, we discuss the need for blockchain interoperability and how it could help to stimulate a paradigm shift from today's closed blockchains to an open system where devices and users can interact with each other across the boundaries of blockchains. For this, we consider the areas of cross-blockchain token transfers, as well as cross-blockchain smart contract invocation and interaction.","[Schulte, Stefan; Sigwart, Marten; Frauenthaler, Philipp] TU Wien, Distributed Syst Grp, Vienna, Austria; [Borkowski, Michael] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Flight Guidance, Braunschweig, Germany","Technische Universitat Wien; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR)","Schulte, S (corresponding author), TU Wien, Distributed Syst Grp, Vienna, Austria.","s.schulte@infosys.tuwien.ac.at; m.sigwart@infosys.tuwien.ac.at; pfrauenthaler@infosys.tuwien.ac.at; michael.borkowski@dlr.de","Schulte, Stefan/I-3110-2019","Schulte, Stefan/0000-0001-6828-9945","Pantos GmbH1 within the TAST research project","Pantos GmbH1 within the TAST research project","The work presented in this paper has received funding from Pantos GmbH1 within the TAST research project.","","19","39","42","3","29","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","1865-1348","","978-3-030-30429-4; 978-3-030-30428-7","LECT NOTES BUS INF P","","","2019","361","","","","","","3","10","","10.1007/978-3-030-30429-4_1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-30429-4_1","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Operations Research & Management Science","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science","BP3BA","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000546027600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

One of their core innovations, Proof-of-Work (PoW), is notoriously inefficient which potentially motivates a centralization of hash power, defeating the original goal of decentralization. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is later proposed to replace PoW. However, both PoW and PoS have different inherent advantages and disadvantages, so does Proof-of-Activity (PoA) of Bentov et al. (SIGMETRICS 2014) which only offers limited hybrids of two mechanisms. On the other hand, the hybrid consensus protocol of Pass and Shi (DISC 2017) aims to improve the efficiency by dynamically maintaining a rotating committee. Yet, there are unsatisfactory issues including chain forks and fair committee election. In this paper, we firstly devise a generalized variant of PoW. After that, we leverage our generalized PoW to construct a fork-free hybrid consensus protocol. We further combine our fork-free hybrid consensus mechanism with PoS for a flexible version of PoA with tunable parameters between PoW and PoS. Compared with Bentov et al.'s PoA, our flexible PoA improves the efficiency, leading to a more applicable consensus protocol. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Conventional DAAs are essentially feedback controllers, and as such, they are inherently reactive. This approach leaves them susceptible to manipulation and often causes them to either under- or over-correct. We present Bonded Mining, a proactive DAA that works by collecting hash rate commitments secured by bond from miners. The difficulty is set directly from the commitments and the bond is used to penalize miners who deviate from their commitment. We devise a statistical test that is capable of detecting hash rate deviations by utilizing only on-blockchain data. The test is sensitive enough to detect a variety of deviations from commitments, while almost never misclassifying honest miners. We demonstrate in simulation that, under reasonable assumptions, Bonded Mining is more effective at maintaining a target block time than the Bitcoin Cash DAA, one of the newest and most dynamic DAAs currently deployed. In this preliminary work, the lowest hash rate miner our approach supports is 1% of the total and we directly consider only two types of fundamental attacks.

However, it is believed that they will soon start to exert negative impact on stakeholders and on the grid. Policy makers advise to phase out two of the most widely applied policies - net metering and feed-in tariff, in favor of support policies that scale better with rising renewable generation. This work quantifies the impact of these traditional policies in future what-if scenarios and confirms the need for their replacement. Based on simulations with real data, we compare net metering and feed-in tariff to four state-of-the-art market-based mechanisms, which involve auction, negotiation and bitcoin-like currency. The paper examines the extent to which each of these mechanisms motivates not only green energy production but also its consumption. The properties and characteristics of the above mechanisms are evaluated from the perspective of key stakeholders in the low voltage grid - prosumers, consumers and energy providers.

This paper gives a brief description of the IoT and its challenges, especially the security aspects. It also discusses how blockchain concept can further resolve these challenges on the SDN-based IoT platform. This paper first discussed the evolution of conventional IoT to the SDN-based IoT, which can resolve many drawbacks of a conventional IoT system. Also, it is focused on how the concept of blockchain can be converged with SDN-based IoT system to further improve its security aspects.

Public blockchains such as Bitcoin realize decentralization at the cost of mining overhead, which is not suitable for real-life scenarios requiring high throughput. Techniques such as the consortium blockchain improve efficiency through partial decentralization. However, the consensus algorithms used in the existing state-of-the-art consortium blockchains face many challenges when dealing with commercial applications. For example, the high communication overhead hinders the scalability of PBFT-based consensus algorithms even though they are efficient at small scale. Hashgraph, one of the most popular Directed Acyclic Graph-based (DAG-based) consensus algorithms, achieves good performance in scalability; however, it does not allow users' dynamic participation. To deal with these challenges, we propose Jointgraph, a Byzantine fault-tolerance consensus algorithm for consortium blockchains based on DAG. In Jointgraph, transactions are packed into events and validated by no less than 2/3 of all members. A supervisor is introduced in our design, who monitors member behaviors and improves consensus efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that Jointgraph outperforms Hashgraph in both throughput and latency.","[Fu Xiang; Wang Huaimin; Shi Peichang; Ouyang Xue; Zhang Xunhui] Natl Univ Def Technol, Sch Comp, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Fu Xiang; Wang Huaimin; Shi Peichang; Zhang Xunhui] Key Lab Software Engn Complex Syst, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China","National University of Defense Technology - China","Shi, PC (corresponding author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Sch Comp, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China.","shipeichang@kylinos.cn","Zhang, Xunhui/AAW-7324-2021","Zhang, Xunhui/0000-0002-4027-9443","National Key RAMP;D Program of China [2016YFB1000100]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61772030]; GF Innovative Research Program","National Key RAMP;D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); GF Innovative Research Program","National Key R&D Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFB1000100; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 61772030; GF Innovative Research Program","","38","7","8","16","69","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0038-0644","1097-024X","","SOFTWARE PRACT EXPER","Softw.-Pract.

These challenges pose extreme pressure on finding advanced technologies and sustainable solutions for secure and reliable operations of the power system. The blockchain is one of the recent technologies that have gained lots of attention in different applications including smart grid for its uniqueness and decentralized nature. In the last few years, this technology grew a momentum specifically with the cryptocurrencies' industry such as the Bitcoin and Etherium. The Blockchain's applications in the smart grids could offer many innovative and affordable solutions to some of the challenges that the future and the current smart grids will be facing. This paper reviews different prospects, advantages, approaches, and technical challenges of utilizing the blockchain technology in the smart grid, and presents frameworks for key smart grid blockchain-based applications; more specifically, it is shown that how the blockchain can be used as the smart grid's cyber-physical layer.","[Musleh, Ahmed S.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Elect Engn & Telecommun, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Yao, Gang] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Sino Dutch Mechatron Engn Dept, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Muyeen, S.

Users protect their private keys using crypto wallets to keep their funds safe from hackers. While the most secure option is hardware wallet, it suffers from lack of a secure and convenient backup and recovery process. Almost all existing wallets use mnemonics to back up the private keys, and a user must write down these words on a piece of paper. This approach is not only inconvenient but also problematic since the paper could be lost or stolen, resulting in a hacker recovering the keys. In this paper, we propose a new digital scheme to securely back up a hardware wallet relying on the side-channel human visual verification enabled by display screen on a hardware wallet. Using this method, we transfer the root of private keys from one hardware wallet to another wallet securely even via an untrusted terminal, such as a smartphone. At the end of this process, the user has two hardware wallets with the same private keys while she may use one of them as the main wallet and another one as a backup wallet.","[Rezaeighaleh, Hossein; Zou, Cliff C.] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Comp Sci, Orlando, FL 32816 USA","State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida","Rezaeighaleh, H (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Dept Comp Sci, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.","rezaei@knights.ucf.edu; czou@cs.ucf.edu","","","National Science Foundation [DGE-1723587]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under grant DGE-1723587.","","17","6","6","3","4","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2334-0983","","978-1-7281-0962-6","IEEE GLOB COMM CONF","","","2019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BP4GG","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000552238604118","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The use of different BCs for the same purpose could hamper the frictionless exchange of data or value. On one hand, it is natural that there are competing implementations exploring the benefits of BC. On the other hand, the problem of siloed data re-emerges, with respect to isolated chains. In this regard, BC interoperability is necessary to connect different BCs, exchanging information and assets. Moreover, to foster BC employment, developers must be able to interact with such different BCs without knowing the details of each implementation. This paper presents a novel solution, called Bifrost, to store and retrieve data on different BCs. Bifrost employs a notary scheme, which allows for connectivity to different BCs. The presented prototype is highly modular and currently implements seven adapters to popular BC implementations, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Stellar. The developed prototype was evaluated concerning performance, security, and data size to verify the feasibility of such an implementation and assess design decisions taken during its development.","[Scheid, Eder J.; Hegnauer, Timo; Rodrigues, Bruno; Stiller, Burkhard] Univ Zurich UZH, Dept Informat IfI, Commun Syst Grp CSG, Binzmuhlestr 14, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland","University of Zurich","Scheid, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Zurich UZH, Dept Informat IfI, Commun Syst Grp CSG, Binzmuhlestr 14, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.","scheid@ifi.uzh.ch; t.hegnauer@gmail.com; rodrigues@ifi.uzh.ch; stiller@ifi.uzh.ch","John Scheid, Eder/AAH-1972-2019; Rodrigues, Bruno/AAC-3124-2021","John Scheid, Eder/0000-0002-7989-5286; Rodrigues, Bruno/0000-0003-3277-3799","Komission fur Technologie und Innovation (KTI), Switzerland (CTI) [26996.LPFES-ED]","Komission fur Technologie und Innovation (KTI), Switzerland (CTI)","This work has been supported by Komission fur Technologie und Innovation (KTI), Switzerland (CTI-No. 26996.LPFES-ED).

This has prompted the creation of privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies such as Monero and Zcash, which are specifically designed to counteract the tracking analysis possible in currencies like Bitcoin. These cryptocurrencies, however, also suffer from some drawbacks: in both Monero and Zcash, the set of potential unspent coins is always growing, which means users cannot store a concise representation of the blockchain. Additionally, Zcash requires a common reference string and the fact that addresses are reused multiple times in Monero has led to attacks to its anonymity. In this paper we propose a new design for anonymous cryptocurrencies, Quisquis, that achieves provably secure notions of anonymity. Quisquis stores a relatively small amount of data, does not require trusted setup, and in Quisquis each address appears on the blockchain at most twice: once when it is generated as output of a transaction, and once when it is spent as input to a transaction. Our result is achieved by combining a DDH-based tool (that we call updatable keys) with efficient zero-knowledge arguments.","[Fauzi, Prastudy] Simula UiB, Bergen, Norway; [Meiklejohn, Sarah] UCL, London, England; [Mercer, Rebekah] O1 Labs, San Francisco, CA USA; [Orlandi, Claudio] Aarhus Univ, Dept Comp Sci, DIGIT, Aarhus, Denmark","University of London; University College London; Aarhus University","Fauzi, P (corresponding author), Simula UiB, Bergen, Norway.","prastudy.fauzi@gmail.com","","Fauzi, Prastudy/0000-0001-6800-7821; Orlandi, Claudio/0000-0003-4992-0249","EPSRC [EP/N028104/1]; Concordium Blockhain Research Center, Aarhus University, Denmark; Carlsberg Foundation under the Semper Ardens Research Project [CF18-112]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [803096]; Danish Independent Research Council [DFF-6108-00169]; European Union [731583]","EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Concordium Blockhain Research Center, Aarhus University, Denmark; Carlsberg Foundation under the Semper Ardens Research Project; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)); Danish Independent Research Council(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); European Union(European Commission)","Sarah Meiklejohn was supported in part by EPSRC Grant EP/N028104/1.

DAGBENCH provides a number of sample workloads and adaptors that make effective and easy evaluation of different DAG implementations.It allows any DAG implementation to be evaluated by adding an adaptor. DAGBENCH allows to measure the performance of DAG implementation in terms of throughput, latency, scalability, success indicator, resource consumption, transaction data size and transaction fee. We demonstrate the efficacy of DAGBENCH with different DAG implementations. In particular, we have conducted experiments, on Amazon EC2, with three popular DAG implementations: IOTA, Nano and Byteball.

However, the traditional microgrid trading model has some shortcomings, such as high operation cost and poor security. Therefore, in this paper, a microgrid market trading model was developed using consortium blockchain technology and Nash game equilibrium theory. Firstly, blockchain container is used to authenticate the users who want to participate in the transaction. Then, the pricing system collects and integrates transaction requests submitted by users, then formulates transaction pricing strategy of microgrid using Nash equilibrium theory. Finally, the price, trading volume, and user information are submitted to the blockchain container for transaction matching to achieve the transaction. After the transaction is completed, its related information is recorded in the hyperledger and the dispatch system is called.

Targeting at big industrial energy users, this paper first presents a new market structure (i.e., transaction rules) under existing blockchain-based electricity transaction platforms to cover popular types of markets such as contract, day-ahead, adjustment and balancing markets; and then focuses on the optimal load management problem for a particular industrial user. The proof-of-work cost from blockchain is also modeled. A key feature of this load management problem is that the user has direct control on its own load. The obtained load control model is much more accurate than existing approaches in which system operators or demand aggregators cannot control load directly and have to rely on inaccurate estimations. As a case study, the pumping load of a water supply plant is investigated to illustrate how the demand load is managed under this blockchain-based market. From the case study, it is found that 18.9% of total cost can be saved under this new market structure.","[Dang, Can] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Engn, State Key Lab Elect Insulat & Power Equipment, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jiangfeng; Li, Li] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Elect & Data Engn, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Kwong, Chung-Ping] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Xi'an Jiaotong University; University of Technology Sydney; Chinese University of Hong Kong","Zhang, JF (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Elect & Data Engn, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.","can.dang_cn@yahoo.com; jiangfeng.zhang@uts.edu.au; li.li@uts.edu.au; cpkwong@mae.cuhk.edu.hk","Zhang, Jiangfeng/E-6891-2011; Li, Li/M-6866-2013","Zhang, Jiangfeng/0000-0003-2616-6722; Li, Li/0000-0001-8485-2216","","","","","36","39","40","2","27","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","1949-3053","1949-3061","","IEEE T SMART GRID","IEEE Trans.

Importantly, blockchain represents a data architecture, whose application goes far beyond Bitcoin - the cryptocurrency that relies on blockchain and has popularized the technology. In the health sector, blockchain is being aggressively explored by various stakeholders to optimize business processes, lower costs, improve patient outcomes, enhance compliance, and enable better use of healthcare-related data. However, critical in assessing whether blockchain can fulfill the hype of a technology characterized as revolutionary' and disruptive', is the need to ensure that blockchain design elements consider actual healthcare needs from the diverse perspectives of consumers, patients, providers, and regulators. In addition, answering the real needs of healthcare stakeholders, blockchain approaches must also be responsive to the unique challenges faced in healthcare compared to other sectors of the economy. In this sense, ensuring that a health blockchain is fit-for-purpose' is pivotal. This concept forms the basis for this article, where we share views from a multidisciplinary group of practitioners at the forefront of blockchain conceptualization, development, and deployment.","[Mackey, Tim K.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Mackey, Tim K.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Div Infect Dis & Global Publ Hlth, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Mackey, Tim K.] Univ Calif San Diego Extens, Dept Healthcare Policy Technol & Res, San Diego, CA 92037 USA; [Mackey, Tim K.] Global Hlth Policy Inst, San Diego, CA USA; [Mackey, Tim K.] San Diego Supercomp Ctr, BlockLAB, La Jolla, CA USA; [Kuo, Tsung-Ting] Univ Calif San Diego, UCSD Hlth Dept Biomed Informat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Gummadi, Basker] Bayer Corp, 100 Bayer Blvd, Whippany, NJ 07981 USA; [Clauson, Kevin A.] Lipscomb Univ, Coll Pharm & Hlth Sci, Dept Pharm Practice, Nashville, TN USA; [Church, George; Grishin, Dennis] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Church, George; Grishin, Dennis; Obbad, Kamal] Nebula Genom Inc, San Francisco, CA USA; [Barkovich, Robert] Prod Consulting, Mountain View, CA USA; [Barkovich, Robert] Hlth Linkages Inc, Mountain View, CA USA; [Palombini, Maria] IEEE Stand Assoc, 445 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Bayer AG; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School","Mackey, TK (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.;Mackey, TK (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Div Infect Dis & Global Publ Hlth, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.;Mackey, TK (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego Extens, Dept Healthcare Policy Technol & Res, San Diego, CA 92037 USA.","tmackey@ucsd.edu","Mackey, Tim/H-9156-2013","Mackey, Tim/0000-0002-2191-7833; Kuo, Tsung-Ting/0000-0002-8728-4477; church, george/0000-0001-6232-9969","National Human Genome Research Institute; US National Institutes of Health [K99HG009680, R00HG009680]; NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE [R00HG009680, K99HG009680] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","National Human Genome Research Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)); US National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI))","T-TK acknowledges support from the National Human Genome Research Institute (https://www.genome.gov) of the US National Institutes of Health under Award Number K99HG009680 and R00HG009680.

At first, decentralized and opportunistic cognitive radios (and cognitive radio networks) were the primary focus of research for these mechanisms. This gradually transitioned toward the development of cooperative sharing methods based on databases, typified by TV white spaces databases. Spectrum sharing is now the basis for the dynamic and fine-grained spectrum rights regime for the citizen's band radio service (CBRS) as well as for license shared access (LSA). The emergence of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin has stimulated interest in applying its underlying technology, blockchain, to other applications as well, such as securities trading and supply chain management. This paper explores the application of blockchain to radio spectrum management. While blockchains could underlie radio spectrum management more broadly, we will focus on dynamic spectrum sharing applications. Like the cooperative approaches currently in use, blockchain is a database technology. However, a blockchain is a decentralized database in which the owner of the data maintains control. We consider the benefits and limitations of blockchain solutions in general, and then examine their potential application to four major categories of spectrum sharing.","[Weiss, Martin B.

However, several of the heterogeneous characteristics that make them ideal for certain future applications-robot autonomy, decentralized control, collective emergent behavior, etc.-hinder the evolution of the technology from academic institutions to real-world problems. Blockchain, an emerging technology originated in the Bitcoin field, demonstrates that by combining peer-to-peer networks with cryptographic algorithms a group of agents can reach an agreement on a particular state of affairs and record that agreement without the need for a controlling authority. The combination of blockchain with other distributed systems, such as robotic swarm systems, can provide the necessary capabilities to make robotic swarm operations more secure, autonomous, flexible and even profitable. This position paper explains how blockchain technology can provide innovative solutions to four emergent issues in the swarm robotics research field. New security, decision making, behavior differentiation and business models for swarm robotic systems are described by providing case scenarios and examples. Finally, limitations and possible future problems that arise from the combination of these two technologies are described.","[Ferrer, Eduardo Castello] MIT, Media Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)","Ferrer, EC (corresponding author), MIT, Media Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.","ecstll@media.mit.edu","","","","","","","53","83","85","5","32","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","2194-5357","2194-5365","978-3-030-02683-7; 978-3-030-02682-0","ADV INTELL SYST","","","2019","881","","","","","","1037","1058","","10.1007/978-3-030-02683-7_77","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-02683-7_77","","","22","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO2GP","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000505677700077","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The underlying model is an indivisible goods / indivisible money, dual currency search model similar to that in Kiyotaki and Wright (1993) and Curtis and Waller (2000). In such models, there are two pure Nash equilibria - total acceptance or total rejection of the secondary currency - and one unstable, mixed equilibrium. This mixed equilibrium is considered an artifact of the indivisibility of money and goods in the model and is often ignored. I find that when a significant friction - in this case the inability to barter - is introduced, the equilibrium tends towards complete acceptance of the secondary currency. Conversely, when barter is readily available to subjects, the equilibrium tends towards total rejection. As predicted by theory, the tendency towards one equilibrium or the other appears to be influenced by the mixed equilibrium and the related basins of attraction. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The best known example of distributed ledger is perhaps the Bitcoin blockchain, which maintains a consistent history of financial transactions organized as a hashed chain of blocks. Distributed ledgers can be public, i.e., accessible by everyone, or private, i.e., accessible only by a given consortium of parties. In this paper, we explore the technological possibilities of applying Identity-Based Encryption and Attribute-Based Encryption to distributed ledgers. We introduce the novel concept of Virtual Private Ledger. A Virtual Private Ledger is a private distributed ledger embedded in a public cryptocurrency ledger by means of cryptography. A Virtual Private Ledger provides for the same confidentiality and integrity of a private distributed ledger, but without its high operational costs. In particular, nodes that maintain the ledger do not have to be always online to trust the order and the integrity of the records. We analytically show that Virtual Private Ledgers can be implemented over many existing cryptocurrency ledgers like Ethereum, EOS.IO, IOTA, XRP. Different cryptocurrencies lead to different trade-offs between the Virtual Private Ledger max record size, cost, validation time, and max consortium members.","[Arena, Antonio; Perazzo, Pericle; Dini, Gianluca] Univ Pisa, Dept Informat Engn, Largo Lucio Lazzarino 1, I-56122 Pisa, Italy","University of Pisa","Arena, A (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Informat Engn, Largo Lucio Lazzarino 1, I-56122 Pisa, Italy.","antonio.arena@ing.unipi.it; pericle.perazzo@iet.unipi.it; gianluca.dini@iet.unipi.it","","","Italian Ministry of Education and Research (MIUR); University of Pisa [PRA_2018_81]","Italian Ministry of Education and Research (MIUR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); University of Pisa","This work was partially supported by the Italian Ministry of Education and Research (MIUR) in the framework of the CrossLab project (Departments of Excellence) and by the University of Pisa in the framework of the project PRA_2018_81 Wearable sensor systems: personalized analysis and data security in healthcare.","","30","4","4","0","0","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1098-8068","","978-1-4503-6249-8","INT DATABASE ENG APP","","","2019","","","","","","","78","86","","10.1145/3331076.3331083","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3331076.3331083","","","9","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT2KT","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000810167700010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

As a result, Ponzi schemes are proliferating on Ethereum, dressed up as secure investment schemes. They reward early investors with funds from the later ones before collapsing, leaving the last investors empty handed. Illegal in the offline world, they are creating thousands of victims on Ethereum, while stealing millions of dollars worth of ether. We use data mining to provide a detection model for Ponzi schemes on Ethereum, improving over prior work. We built a dataset of likely benign Ethereum smart contracts, in addition to known Ponzi scheme smart contracts, and designed features based on their compiled code and transactions. Using Weka to benchmark several classification algorithms, we obtained models that achieve both high precision and high recall. Our 0-day model can be used as soon as a smart contract is uploaded on the blockchain. The full-feature model continued to show high performance for almost 250 days.

To some surprise, these have been shown to share a number of structural properties regardless of their type or origin. It is thus of vital importance to design simple and intuitive models that can explain their intrinsic structure and dynamics. These can, for instance, be used to study networks analytically or to construct networks not observed in real life. Most models proposed in the literature are of two types. A model can be either static, where edges are added between a fixed set of nodes according to some predefined rule, or evolving, where the number of nodes or edges increases over time. However, some real networks do not grow but rather shrink, meaning that the number of nodes or edges decreases over time. We here propose a simple model of shrinking networks called the war pact model. We show that networks generated in such a way exhibit common structural properties of real networks. Furthermore, compared to classical models, these resemble international trade, correlates of war, Bitcoin transactions and other networks more closely. Network shrinking may therefore represent a reasonable explanation of the evolution of some networks and greater emphasis should be put on such models in the future.","[Naglic, Luka] Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Zagreb, Croatia; [Subelj, Lovro] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Comp & Informat Sci, Ljubljana, Slovenia","University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb, School of Dental Medicine; University of Ljubljana","Subelj, L (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Fac Comp & Informat Sci, Ljubljana, Slovenia.","lovro.subelj@fri.uni-lj.si","Šubelj, Lovro/V-9106-2018","Šubelj, Lovro/0000-0002-4161-2260; Naglic, Luka/0000-0003-3448-3197","Slovenian Research Agency [P50168]; European Union COST Action [CA15109]","Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia); European Union COST Action","This study has been supported by the Slovenian Research Agency under the program P50168 and by the European Union COST Action number CA15109.

It first appeared as a cryptocurrency, called Bitcoin, but has since been used in many other business and nonbusiness applications. Unlike most existing systems that are based on centralized frameworks, this new technology utilizes peer-to-peer networks and distributed systems which includes blockchain registers to store transactions. Its structure is designed as a digital log file and stored as a series of linked groups, called blocks. Each individual block is locked cryptographically with the previous block. Once a block has been added, it cannot be altered. Many security experts speculate that the inherent cryptographic nature of the blockchain system is sufficient to withstand constant hacking and security threats. However, previous studies on the security and privacy of blockchain technology have shown that many applications have fallen victim to successful cyberattacks. Owing to the increasing demand for cryptocurrency and its current security challenges, previous studies have not focused on blockchain technology cybersecurity vulnerabilities extensively. Here, our study extends upon the previous studies on vulnerabilities and investigates the types of potential attacks. Our study then provides further direction to highlight possible countermeasures against blockchain technology vulnerability to cybersecurity.","[Hasanova, Huru; Baek, Ui-jun; Shin, Mu-gon; Cho, Kyunghee; Kim, Myung-Sup] Korea Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Sejong, South Korea","Korea University","Kim, MS (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Sejong, South Korea.","tmskim@korea.ac.kr","","Hasanova, Huru/0000-0003-4316-2395; Kim, Myung-Sup/0000-0002-3809-2057","Institute for Information & Communications Technology Promotion (IITP) [2018-0-00539-001]","Institute for Information & Communications Technology Promotion (IITP)","Institute for Information & Communications Technology Promotion (IITP), Grant/Award Number: 2018-0-00539-001","","60","51","51","4","41","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1055-7148","1099-1190","","INT J NETW MANAG","Int.

Ethereum [2] and its smart contract model have proven to be a very popular choice for this task, routinely managing assets valued in the billions. However, development of such contracts has been anything but easy. While formally specified, the Ethereum execution platform is based on a low-level machine, quite similar to assembly; semantics for contract operations such as call are quite complex, and the need for resource management creates unanticipated modes of failure. The dominant day-to-day programming platform for Ethereum is Solidity [3], an Object-Oriented language that identifies contracts with objects. While reasoning about Solidity programs is much easier than for their bytecode counterparts, it is not extent of challenges either, and moreover, Solidity lacks a source-level semantics, which forces developers to reason over output bytecode again. In this short paper we explore the main barriers to lift in order to achieve a principled compilation strategy for Solidity. We will review the standard concepts on verified and secure compilation, and frame them in the context of the Ethereum platform.","[Arias, Emilio Jesus Gallego] PSL Univ Blockchain Adv Res & Technol, MINES ParisTech, Ctr Rech Informat, Paris, France","UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; MINES ParisTech","Arias, EJG (corresponding author), PSL Univ Blockchain Adv Res & Technol, MINES ParisTech, Ctr Rech Informat, Paris, France.","e@x80.org","","","","","","","29","0","0","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2157-4952","","978-1-7281-1542-9","INT CONF NEW TECHNOL","","","2019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BO0LX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000492033300061","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this article is proposed the use of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology as a tool to reduce poverty in the region through economic activities from tourism. A detailed analysis of the potentialities collected by tourism, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology was carried out. Due to the tourism capabilities of the Latin American and Caribbean regions, a set of efforts must be made by governments and private companies to implement tourism development in regions and locations with great biodiversity and cultural resources not yet explored. The relative access to bitcoin accounts through smartphones means that financial transactions through cryptocurrencies are available to small merchants who normally do not have access to traditional bank accounts. On the other hand, access to the internet via mobile telephony must be further strengthened to facilitate payment systems and so that blockchain-based technologies can be developed at maximum capacity. It is concluded that in order to achieve a significant reduction of poverty. it is necessary an adequate regulation of the cryptocurrencies by the governments as well as the development of an adequate infrastructure that allows the creation and / or recovery of microenterprises boosted by the Initial Coin Offering (ICO).","[Barrutia Barreto, Israel] Univ Cient Sur, Lima, Peru; [Urquizo Maggia, Jose Antonio] Univ Nacl Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru; [Isaias Acevedo, Samuel] Innova Sci SAC, Res, Lima, Peru","Universidad Cientifica del Sur (CIENTIFICA); Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal","Barreto, IB (corresponding author), Univ Cient Sur, Lima, Peru.","ibarrutia@ucientffica.edu.pe; josurisc@gmail.com; sacevedo@innovascientific.edu.pe","Barrutia, Israel/ABA-2669-2020","Barrutia, Israel/0000-0002-5728-0651","","","","","74","4","4","8","34","UNIV POLITECNICA SALESIANA ECUADOR-SALESIAN POLYTECNIC UNIV","CUENCA","CALLE TURUHUAYO 3-69 & CALLE VIEJA, CUENCA, 00000, ECUADOR","1390-6291","1390-8618","","RETOS-REV CIENC ADM","Retos","OCT-MAR","2019","9","18","","","","","275","290","","10.17163/ret.n18.2019.07","http://dx.doi.org/10.17163/ret.n18.2019.07","","","16","Economics","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Business & Economics","JB3UZ","","Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000488483500007","View Full Record in Web of Science"

As the number of users and transactions grows, this requirement becomes a significant burden, requiring users to download, verify, and store a large amount of data to participate. Vault is a new cryptocurrency design based on Algorand that minimizes these storage and bootstrapping costs for participants. Vault's design is based on Algorand's proof-of-stake consensus protocol and uses several techniques to achieve its goals. First, Vault decouples the storage of recent transactions from the storage of account balances, which enables Vault to delete old account state. Second, Vault allows sharding state across participants in a way that preserves strong security guarantees. Finally, Vault introduces the notion of stamping certificates, which allow a new client to catch up securely and efficiently in a proof-of-stake system without having to verify every single block. Experiments with a prototype implementation of Vault's data structures show that Vault's design reduces the bandwidth cost of joining the network as a full client by 99.7% compared to Bitcoin and 90.5% compared to Ethereum when downloading a ledger containing 500 million transactions.","[Leung, Derek; Suhl, Adam; Gilad, Yossi; Zeldovich, Nickolai] MIT CSAIL, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)","Leung, D (corresponding author), MIT CSAIL, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.","","","","NSF [CNS-1413920, CNS-1414119]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We thank the anonymous reviewers and our shepherd, Aniket Kate, for helping us improve this paper.

Prior research in blockchain security studied such financial incentives for the miners and identified attacks based on withholding and delaying block submissions. Among such attacks, the fork-after-withholding (FAW) attack is the state of the art and provides practical incentives to the rational attacker by increasing its reward at the expense of the rest of the miners in the compromised pool. To defend against FAW attack, we propose Silent Timestamping, which has the mining pool manager enforce the ordering of the shares. Implemented at the mining pool manager, Silent Timestamping does not require networking nor any behavior- or implementation-changes in the miners; the lack of the implementation overheads distinguish Silent Timestamping from other schemes which have been proposed but had limited success in practice. We analyze the optimal attacker behavior against Silent Timestamping and the effectiveness of Silent Timestamping against FAW attack. Silent Timestamping effectively nullifies the reward gain of the FAW attack and reduces the optimal FAW attacker strategy to be either the suboptimal block-withholding attack (which never submits the withheld block in the compromised pool and provides limited incentives for a rational attacker) or honest mining.","[Chang, Sang-Yoon] Univ Colorado, Colorado Springs, CO 80907 USA; [Park, Younghee] San Jose State Univ, San Jose, CA 95192 USA","University of Colorado System; University of Colorado at Colorado Springs; California State University System; San Jose State University","Chang, SY (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Colorado Springs, CO 80907 USA.","schang2@uccs.edu; younghee.park@sjsu.edu","","","","","","","17","19","19","1","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2325-2626","","978-1-5386-9223-3","INT CONF COMPUT NETW","","","2019","","","","","","","1","5","","10.1109/ICCNC.2019.8685563","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCNC.2019.8685563","","","5","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BM8NO","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000469493200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Can blockchains address complex administration problems? What key issues of note for practitioners and academics have emerged thus far? In this paper we aim to review the existing governance practices of established or popular blockchain and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) systems with a view to understanding how they hold up in times of crises. What questions are raised when they are compromised or faced consensus challenges in coordinating action especially around control and accountability? We use a translational process, generating focal insights about present concerns from the reference point of completed academic studies and extensive practitioner consultation. Rather than adopting a declarative approach attempting to provide all the answers, we draw insights from the IT platform governance literature to offer a critical perspective for asking the right questions around key governance issues in financial infrastructure such as decision rights, control mechanisms, and incentives.","[Zachariadis, Markos] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Informat Syst & Management Grp, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Hileman, Garrick] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Ctr Macroecon, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Scott, Susan V.] London Sch Econ, Dept Management, Informat Syst & Innovat Grp, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England","University of Warwick; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science","Zachariadis, M (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Informat Syst & Management Grp, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.","markos.zachariadis@wbs.ac.uk","Londe, Pedro/AAG-2267-2019","Zachariadis, Markos/0000-0002-6534-781X; Hileman, Garrick/0000-0003-1663-5046","","","","","50","59","64","20","109","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","1471-7727","1873-7919","","INFORM ORGAN-UK","Inf.

Specifically, the algorithm efficiently determines the optimal non-linear mapping and the corresponding lead-lag structure between two time series. Afterwards, this study explores the use of optimal causal paths as a means for identifying promising stock pairs and for generating buy and sell signals. For this purpose, the established trading strategy exploits information about the leading stock to predict future returns of the following stock. The value-add of the proposed framework is assessed by benchmarking it with variants relying on classic similarity measures and a buy-and-hold investment in the S&P 500 index. In the empirical back-testing study, the trading algorithm generates statistically and economically significant returns of 54.98% p.a. and an annualized Sharpe ratio of 3.57 after transaction costs. Returns are well superior to the benchmark approaches and do not load on any common sources of systematic risk. The strategy outperforms in the context of cryptocurrencies even in recent times due to the fact that stock returns contain substantial information about the future bitcoin returns.","[Stuebinger, Johannes] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Stat & Econometr, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany","University of Erlangen Nuremberg","Stubinger, J (corresponding author), Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Stat & Econometr, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany.","johannes.stuebinger@fau.de","","","","","","","78","20","20","3","36","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1469-7688","1469-7696","","QUANT FINANC","Quant.

By means of the Traveling Salesperson Problem as model problem, we propose a concept to use optimization algorithms in an iterative manner to provide the Proof-of-Work needed to expand the Blockchain by a new block. The basic idea is to improve the tour cost for the best tour found for block n, extended by adding one more city, as a requirement for the inclusion of a new block in the Blockchain. This allows for the design of limited Blockchains, solving the underlying combinatorial optimization problems at the same time. Independently, it calls in for new efficient optimization algorithms and can serve as a real-world contest. It is discussed that metaheuristic algorithms perform an attractive class of optimization algorithms that can be used for the proposed approach. Numerical experiments also demonstrate the growth in problem complexity being handled by a binary PSO, which is a basic requirement for the full concept to work in practice.","[Syafruddin, Willa Ariela; Dadkhah, Sajjad; Koppen, Mario] Kyushu Inst Technol, Grad Sch Creat Informat, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan","Kyushu Institute of Technology","Syafruddin, WA (corresponding author), Kyushu Inst Technol, Grad Sch Creat Informat, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan.","syafruddin.willa-ariela966@mail.kyutech.jp; dadkhah.sajjadl97@mail.kyutech.jp; mkoeppen@ieee.org","","","Kyushu Institute of Technology","Kyushu Institute of Technology","The authors of this article would like to thank Kyushu Institute of Technology for their financial and educational support.","","14","2","2","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-2153-6","IEEE C EVOL COMPUTAT","","","2019","","","","","","","771","776","","","","","","6","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Mathematical & Computational Biology","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Mathematical & Computational Biology","BO1QN","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000502087100102","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The emergence of the blockchain technology brings in high hopes for fulfilling most of those requirements. However, a major challenge is to find a proper consensus protocol that is applicable to the crowdsourcing services in particular and online services in general. Building upon the idea of using blockchain as the underlying technology to enable tracing transactions for service contracts and dispute arbitration, this paper proposes a novel consensus protocol that is suitable for the crowdsourcing as well as the general online service industry. The new consensus protocol is called Proof-of-Trust (PoT) consensus; it selects transaction validators based on the service participants' trust values while leveraging RAFT leader election and Shamir's secret sharing algorithms. The PoT protocol avoids the low throughput and resource intensive pitfalls associated with Bitcoin' s Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining, while addressing the scalability issue associated with the traditional Paxos-based and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)-based algorithms. In addition, it addresses the unfaithful behaviors that cannot be dealt with in the traditional BFT algorithms. The paper demonstrates that our approach can provide a viable accountability solution for the online service industry.","[Zou, Jun; Ye, Bin; Qu, Lie; Wang, Yan; Orgun, Mehmet A.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Comp, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Li, Lei] Hefei Univ Technol, Hefei 230000, Anhui, Peoples R China","Macquarie University; Hefei University of Technology","Zou, J (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Comp, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.","jun.zou@students.mq.edu.au; bin.ye@students.mq.edu.au; lie.qu@mq.edu.au; yan.wang@mq.edu.au; mehmet.orgun@mq.edu.au; lilei@hfut.edu.cn","Orgun, Mehmet/AAL-7178-2020; Li, Lei/M-6059-2017","Orgun, Mehmet/0000-0002-7873-1562; Ye, Bin/0000-0001-9052-5756; Wang, Yan/0000-0002-5344-1884; Li, Lei/0000-0002-5374-7293","","","","","39","85","85","5","56","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA","1939-1374","","","IEEE T SERV COMPUT","IEEE Trans.

We argue that rigorous models are required for capturing the ledger semantics, the protocol-ledger interaction, the cryptographic primitives and, ultimately, the security properties one would like to achieve. Our focus is on a particular level of abstraction, where network messages are represented by a term algebra, protocol execution by state transition systems (e.g. multiset rewrite rules) and where the properties of interest can be analyzed with automated verification tools.We propose models for: (1) the rules guiding the ledger execution, taking the coin functionality of public ledgers such as Bitcoin as an example; (2) the security properties expected from ledger-based zero-knowledge contingent payment protocols; (3) two different security protocols that aim at achieving these properties relying on different ledger infrastructures; (4) reductions that allow simpler term algebras for homomorphic cryptographic schemes. Altogether, these models allow us to derive a first automated verification for ledger-based zero-knowledge contingent payment using the Tamarin prover. Furthermore, our models help in clarifying certain underlying assumptions, security and efficiency tradeoffs that should be taken into account when deploying protocols on the blockchain.","[Bursuc, Sergiu] Inria Nancy Grand Est, Villers Les Nancy, France; LORIA, Villers Les Nancy, France","Universite de Lorraine","Bursuc, S (corresponding author), Inria Nancy Grand Est, Villers Les Nancy, France.","sergiu.bursuc@inria.fr","","","European Research Council (ERC) [645865-SPOOC]","European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission)","The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreements No. 645865-SPOOC).","","48","0","0","3","6","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-29959-0; 978-3-030-29958-3","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2019","11735","","","","","","361","382","","10.1007/978-3-030-29959-0_18","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-29959-0_18","","","22","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP1RO","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000540648600018","View Full Record in Web of Science"

So far, two main mechanisms are being discussed: proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS). PoW relies on demonstration of computational power, and comes with the markup of huge energy wastage in return of the stake in cyrpto-currency. PoS tries to address this by relying on owned stake (i.e., amount of crypto-currency) in the system. In both cases, Blockchains are limited to systems with financial basis. This forces non-crypto-currency Blockchain applications to resort to permissioned setting only, effectively centralizing the system. However, non-crypto-currency permisionless blockhains could enable secure and self-governed peer-to-peer structures for numerous emerging application domains, such as education and health, where some trust exists among peers. This creates a new possibility for valuing trust among peers and capitalizing it as the basis (stake) for reaching consensus. In this paper we show that there is a viable way for permisionless non-financial Blockhains to operate in completely decentralized environments and achieve leader election through proof-of-trust (PoT). In our PoT construction, peer trust is extracted from a trust network that emerges in a decentralized manner and is used as a waiver for the effort to be spent for PoW, thus dramatically reducing total energy expenditure of the system. Furthermore, our PoT construction is resilient to the risk of small cartels monopolizing the network (as it happens with the mining-pool phenomena in PoW) and is not vulnerable to sybils. We evluate security guarantees, and perform experimental evaluation of our construction, demonstrating up to 10-fold energy savings compared to PoW without trading off any of the decentralization characteristics, with further guarantees against risks of monopolization.","[Bahri, Leila; Girdzijauskas, Sarunas] Royal Inst Technol KTH, Stockholm, Sweden","Royal Institute of Technology","Bahri, L (corresponding author), Royal Inst Technol KTH, Stockholm, Sweden.","lbahri@kth.se; sarunasg@kth.se","","Girdzijauskas, Sarunas/0000-0003-4516-7317","","","","","21","4","4","1","4","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","1063-6927","","978-1-7281-2519-0","INT CON DISTR COMP S","","","2019","","","","","","","1358","1368","","10.1109/ICDCS.2019.00136","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2019.00136","","","11","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP8GA","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000565234200127","View Full Record in Web of Science"

As the blockchains in the form implemented for the cryptocurrencies are not suitable for storing large quantities of data, there is a vivid development of solutions for this purpose going on. Blockchains are extended in two ways. Some extensions allow access only to the user that has stored the data originally. On the other hand, much attention is paid to technologies that would allow the cloud-storage vendors to perform an aggregated analysis, of course with a due respect for privacy of data owners and possibly enabling their control of the data usage, i.e. those who are permitted to use their data when such use is allowed. Analysis of the basic data constituting a blockchain is of a considerable scientific interest as well. Since a blockchain does not provide an analytic tool itself, it is necessary to use an external one. In order to find closely related transaction participants, we chose a graph database, ingested the Ethereum blockchain data into two different data models and found such communities by searching for tours in the graph.","[Drobnic, Franc; Sedlar, Urban; Kos, Andrej; Pustisek, Matevz] Univ Ljubljani, Fak Elektrotehn, Trzaska Cesta 25, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia","University of Ljubljana","Drobnic, F (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljani, Fak Elektrotehn, Trzaska Cesta 25, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.","franc.drobnic@fe.uni-lj.si","","","","","","","25","0","0","2","9","ELECTROMAGNETICS ACAD","CAMBRIDGE","77 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, RM 26-319, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA","0013-5852","2232-3236","","ELEKTROTEH VESTN","Elektroteh.

The system is highly redundant and distributed, making it very difficult for fraudulent financial transactions. While cryptocurrencies might be the most well-known use case of blockchain technology, it is wrong to assume that this technology is restricted to the financial area. Indeed, many blockchain use cases are being developed today in different areas. Due to the complexity of certain processes, a new technology associated to blockchain has appeared smart contracts. These digital contracts act like traditional contracts, with the major difference being their automaticity. In this article, we aim to discuss how blockchain and smart contracts may be used together in order to improve organizational operations. More specifically, we demonstrate how these technologies might be used to develop a solution that avoids certain types of fraud in the area of vehicle insurance. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Off-chain payment channels, a layer 2 solution, are a leading approach for cryptocurrency scaling. They enable two mutually distrustful parties to rapidly send payments between each other and can be linked together to form a payment network, such that payments between any two parties can be routed through the network along a path that connects them. We propose a novel payment channel protocol, called Sprites. The main advantage of Sprites compared with earlier protocols is a reduced collateral cost, meaning the amount of money x time that must be locked up before disputes are settled. In the Lightning Network and Raiden, a payment across a path of l channels requires locking up col- lateral for Theta(l Delta) time, where Delta is the time to commit an on-chain transaction; every additional node on the path forces an increase in lock time. The Sprites construction provides a constant lock time, reducing the overall collateral cost to Theta(l + Delta). Our presentation of the Sprites protocol is also modular, making use of a generic state channel abstraction. Finally, Sprites improves on prior payment channel constructions by supporting partial withdrawals and deposits without any on-chain transactions.","[Miller, Andrew; Bakshi, Surya] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Bentov, Iddo] Cornell Tech, New York, NY USA; [Kumaresan, Ranjit] VISA Res, Palo Alto, CA USA; [McCorry, Patrick] Kings Coll London, London, England","University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of London; King's College London","Miller, A (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.","soc1024@illinois.edu","","","NSF [CNS-1801321, CNS-1617676]; DTR Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); DTR Foundation","Y This work is funded in part by NSF grants CNS-1801321 and CNS-1617676 and a gift from DTR Foundation.","","21","42","46","3","3","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-32101-7; 978-3-030-32100-0","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2019","11598","","","","","","508","526","","10.1007/978-3-030-32101-7_30","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-32101-7_30","","","19","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP1SH","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000540724500030","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We describe a design of two new blockchain consensus protocols, called CHB-consensus and CHBD-consensus, based on a consistent hash algorithm. Honest miners can fairly gain the opportunity to create blocks. They do not consume any extra computational power resources when creating new blocks, and such blocks can obtain the whole blockchain network to confirm consensus with fairness. However, malicious miners have to pay massive computational power resources for attacking the new block creation privilege or double-spending. Blockchain networks formed by CHB-consensus and CHBD-consensus are based on the same security assumption as that in Bitcoin systems, so they save a huge amount of power without sacrificing decentralization or security. We analyze possible attacks and give a rigorous but adjustable validation strategy. CHB-consensus and CHBD-consensus introduce a certification authority (CA) system, which does not have special management or control rights over blockchain networks or data structures, but carries the risk of privacy breaches depending on credibility and reliability of the CA system. Here, we analyze the robustness and energy consumption of CHB-consensus and CHBD-consensus, and demonstrate their advantages through theoretical derivation.","[Yu, Lei; Cai, Heng-yi; Wei, Bo; Hu, Bin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Yu, Lei; Zhao, Xiao-fang; Jin, Yan; Cai, Heng-yi; Wei, Bo; Hu, Bin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computing Technology, CAS","Yu, L (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;Yu, L (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.","yulei@ncic.ac.cn","","Yu, Lei/0000-0003-4316-1763","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61672499, 61772502, 61972382]; Key Special Project of Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission, China [Z181100003218018]; Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia; Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology of China [SKLNST-20162-09]; SV-ICT Blockchain & DAPP Joint Lab of China; ICT-SSC Blockchain Joint Lab of China","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Special Project of Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission, China; Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia; Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology of China; SV-ICT Blockchain & DAPP Joint Lab of China; ICT-SSC Blockchain Joint Lab of China","Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61672499, 61772502, and 61972382), the Key Special Project of Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission, China (No. Z181100003218018), the Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia, Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology of China (No. SKLNST-20162-09), the SV-ICT Blockchain & DAPP Joint Lab of China, and the ICT-SSC Blockchain Joint Lab of China","","21","4","4","3","30","ZHEJIANG UNIV","HANGZHOU","EDITORIAL BOARD, 20 YUGU RD, HANGZHOU, 310027, PEOPLES R CHINA","2095-9184","2095-9230","","FRONT INFORM TECH EL","Front.

The security (unforgeability) property of 2FS requires that an external adversary corrupting either party (the token or the computer the human is using) cannot forge a signature. This primitive is useful in contexts like hardware cryptocurrency wallets in which a signature conveys the authorization of a transaction. By the above security property, a hardware wallet implementing a two-factor signature scheme is secure against attacks mounted by a malicious hardware vendor; in contrast, all currently used wallet systems break under such an attack (and as such are not secure under our definition). We construct efficient provably-secure 2FS schemes which produce either Schnorr signature (assuming the DLOG assumption), or EC-DSA signatures (assuming security of EC-DSA and the CDH assumption) in the Random Oracle Model, and evaluate the performance of implementations of them.

In this work we show that key information for determining blockchain metrics such as the fork rate can be recovered through data extracted from merge mined cryptocurrencies. Specifically, we reconstruct a long-ranging view of forks and stale blocks in Bitcoin from its merge mined child chains, and compare our results to previous findings that were derived from live measurements. Thereby, we show that live monitoring alone is not sufficient to capture a large majority of these events, as we are able to identify a non-negligible portion of stale blocks that were previously unaccounted for. Their authenticity is ensured by cryptographic evidence regarding both, their position in the respective blockchain, as well as the Proof-of-Work difficulty. Furthermore, by applying this new technique to Litecoin and its child cryptocurrencies, we are able to provide the first extensive view and lower bound on the stale block and fork rate in the Litecoin network. Finally, we outline that a recovery of other important metrics and blockchain characteristics through merged mining may also be possible.","[Stifter, Nicholas; Schindler, Philipp; Judmayer, Aljosha; Zamyatin, Alexei; Kern, Andreas; Weippl, Edgar] SBA Res, Vienna, Austria; [Zamyatin, Alexei] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Stifter, Nicholas; Weippl, Edgar] TU Wien, Christian Doppler Lab Secur & Qual Improvement Pr, Inst Informat Syst Engn, Vienna, Austria","Imperial College London; Technische Universitat Wien","Stifter, N (corresponding author), SBA Res, Vienna, Austria.;Stifter, N (corresponding author), TU Wien, Christian Doppler Lab Secur & Qual Improvement Pr, Inst Informat Syst Engn, Vienna, Austria.","nstifter@sba-research.org; pschindler@sba-research.org; ajudmayer@sba-research.org; azamyatin@sba-research.org; akern@sba-research.org; eweippl@sba-research.org","Weippl, Edgar/ABC-6536-2020; Weippl, Edgar/D-5123-2011","Weippl, Edgar/0000-0003-0665-6126; Weippl, Edgar/0000-0003-0665-6126","Christian Doppler Laboratory for Security and Quality Improvement in the Production System Lifecycle (CDL-SQI), Institute of Information Systems Engineering, TU Wien; competence center SBA-K1 - COMET; Christian Doppler Research Association; Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development; Blockchain.com;  [846573];  [858561];  [864738]","Christian Doppler Laboratory for Security and Quality Improvement in the Production System Lifecycle (CDL-SQI), Institute of Information Systems Engineering, TU Wien; competence center SBA-K1 - COMET; Christian Doppler Research Association; Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development; Blockchain.com; ; ; ","We thank Georg Merzdovnik as well as the participants of Dagstuhl Seminar 18152 Blockchains, Smart Contracts and Future Applications for valuable discussions and insights.

Many existing and proposed trading schemes are enabled by blockchain, a distributed ledger technology (DLT) relying on cryptographic proof of ownership rather than human intermediaries to establish energy transactions. This study used an online survey experiment (n = 2064) to investigate how consumer demand for blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer energy trading schemes in the United Kingdom varies depending on how the consumer proposition is designed and communicated. The analysis provides some evidence of a preference for schemes offering to meet a higher proportion of participants' energy needs and for those operating at the city/region (as compared to national or neighbourhood) level. People were more likely to say they would participate when the scheme was framed as being run by their local council, followed by an energy supplier, community energy organization, and social media company. Anonymity was the most valued DLT characteristic and mentioning blockchain's association with Bitcoin led to a substantial decrease in intended uptake. We highlight a range of important questions and implications suggested by these findings for the introduction and operation of P2P trading schemes.","[Fell, Michael J.; Schneiders, Alexandra; Shipworth, David] UCL Energy Inst, London WC1H 0NN, England","University of London; University College London","Fell, MJ (corresponding author), UCL Energy Inst, London WC1H 0NN, England.","michael.fell@ucl.ac.uk; a.schneiders@ucl.ac.uk; d.shipworth@ucl.ac.uk","","Fell, Michael/0000-0003-2764-7464","EPSRC grant PETRAS Internet of Things (IoT) Research Hub under the project The Internet of Energy Things ('P2P-IoET') [EP/N02334X/1]; UKRI Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions [EP/R035288/1]; EPSRC [EP/S035362/1, EP/N02334X/1, EP/R035288/1] Funding Source: UKRI","EPSRC grant PETRAS Internet of Things (IoT) Research Hub under the project The Internet of Energy Things ('P2P-IoET')(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); UKRI Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This research was principally funded by EPSRC grant PETRAS Internet of Things (IoT) Research Hub under the project The Internet of Energy Things ('P2P-IoET'), grant number EP/N02334X/1.

In the United States today, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has little structure in how it monitors cryptocurrencies, merely classifying them as property and having the taxpayer report all losses and gains subject to the rules of personal property. This classification is difficult to apply because the IRS has little control over how the system is regulated. To solve this issue, the United States should either outlaw the use of cryptocurrency altogether or reclassify virtual currency as foreign currency. Making virtual currency use illegal might not be the most practical solution because of its prominence in the market today, but it would provide the federal government a clear way to deal with cryptocurrency. If the United States reclassifies virtual currency as a foreign currency, there would be an established regulatory frame-work in place that the IRS would be able to follow when attempting to monitor the use of virtual currency. With either solution, the United States will be better equipped to regulate the financial marketplace of virtual currencies.","[Lovell, Allison M.] Univ Iowa, Coll Law, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","University of Iowa","Lovell, AM (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Coll Law, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.","","","","","","","","107","3","3","2","2","UNIV IOWA, COLL LAW","IOWA CITY","290 BOYD LAW BLDG, IOWA CITY, IA 52242 USA","0021-0552","","","IOWA LAW REV","Iowa Law Rev.","JAN","2019","104","2","","","","","927","955","","","","","","29","Law","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Government & Law","HI9GB","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000456762200010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based architecture for content delivery networks (B-CDN), which exploits the advances of the blockchain technology to provide a decentralized and secure platform to connect content providers (CPs) with users. On one hand, the proposed B-CDN will leverage the registration and subscription of the users to different CPs, while guaranteeing the user privacy thanks to virtual identity provided by the blockchain network. On the other hand, the B-CDN creates a public immutable database of the requested contents (from all CPs), based on which each CP can better evaluate the user preference on its contents. The benefits of B-CDN are demonstrated via an edge-caching application, in which a feature-based caching algorithm is proposed for all CPs. The proposed caching algorithm is verified with the realistic Movielens dataset. A win-win relation between the CPs and users is observed, where the B-CDN improves user quality of experience and reduces cost of delivering content for the CPs.","[Vu, Thang X.; Chatzinotas, Symeon; Ottersten, Bjorn] Univ Luxembourg, Interdisciplinary Ctr Secur Reliabil & Trust SnT, Luxembourg, Luxembourg","University of Luxembourg","Vu, TX (corresponding author), Univ Luxembourg, Interdisciplinary Ctr Secur Reliabil & Trust SnT, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.","thang.vu@uni.lu; symeon.chatzinotas@uni.lu; bjorn.ottersten@uni.lu","Chatzinotas, Symeon/D-4191-2015; Ottersten, Bjorn/AAF-9147-2019","Chatzinotas, Symeon/0000-0001-5122-0001; ","Luxembourg FNR CORE program [R-AGR-3415-10]","Luxembourg FNR CORE program","This work is supported by the Luxembourg FNR CORE program under project ProCAST (R-AGR-3415-10).","","21","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1525-3511","","978-1-5386-7646-2","IEEE WCNC","","","2019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Telecommunications","BO5YG","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000519086302023","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It is a special PoS protocol where the credit is a special kind of stake quantifying whether the node's activity is beneficial to the system. Any nodes cannot change their credits arbitrarily. We demonstrate that our PoC protocol satisfies the security properties, including common prefix, chain quality, and chain growth, under the assumption that the total credit the honest held is majority. In addition, we propose a self-audit mechanism and a hybrid incentive mechanism to enhance the security and stability.

This paper reports on a systematic review of the ongoing research in the application of blockchain technology in healthcare. The research methodology is based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and a systematic mapping study process, in which a well-designed search protocol is used to search four scientific databases, to identify, extract and analyze all relevant publications. The review shows that a number of studies have proposed different use cases for the application of blockchain in healthcare; however, there is a lack of adequate prototype implementations and studies to characterize the effectiveness of these proposed use cases. The review further highlights the state-of-the-art in the development of blockchain applications for healthcare, their limitations and the areas for future research. To this end, therefore, there is still the need for more research to better understand, characterize and evaluate the utility of blockchain in healthcare.","[Agbo, Cornelius C.; Mahmoud, Qusay H.; Eklund, J.

This paper considers these claims and concludes that they are preferable to defending the status quo or arguing that a solution might be found in more and better regulations. Nevertheless, the future remains highly uncertain and we are currently living in a rapidly evolving space between two competing realities: a centralized old-world reality and a fast-emerging, but, as yet, incomplete, decentralized reality. We remain optimistic that decentralization is coming but identify powerful competing forces seeking to preserve the status quo. As such, we must encourage more organizations - business, government, investors, charities - to experiment with distributed ledger technologies and to participate actively in the digital transformation. We need more experimentation to address the current shortcomings of decentralisation and to ensure the early arrival of mainstream applications of a technology that has the potential to solve some of the most pressing global challenges of a digital age.","[Fenwick, Mark] Kyushu Univ, Fukuoka, Japan; [Vermeulen, Erik P.

However, low throughput has significantly hindered the scalability and usability of cryptocurrency systems for increasing numbers of users and transactions. Another obstacle to achieving scalability is the requirement for every node to duplicate the communication, storage, and state representation of the entire network. In this paper, we introduce the Asynchronous Consensus Zones, which scales blockchain system linearly without compromising decentralization or security. We achieve this by running multiple independent and parallel instances of single- chain consensus systems termed as zones. The consensus happens independently within each zone with minimized communication, which partitions the workload of the entire network and ensures a moderate burden for each individual node as the network grows. We propose eventual atomicity to ensure transaction atomicity across zones, which achieves the efficient completion of transactions without the overhead of a two- phase commit protocol. Additionally, we propose Chu- ko- nu mining to ensure the effective mining power in each zone to be at the same level of the entire network, making an attack on any individual zone as hard as that on the full network. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of our work: on a testbed including 1,200 virtual machines worldwide to support 48,000 nodes, our system delivers 1,000 x throughput and 2,000 x capacity over the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.","[Wang, Jiaping] Chinese Acad Sci, ICT, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jiaping] Sinovat AI Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hao] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University","Wang, JP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, ICT, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wang, JP (corresponding author), Sinovat AI Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China.","","","","","","","","43","115","132","0","3","USENIX ASSOC","BERKELEY","SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA","","","978-1-931971-49-2","","","","2019","","","","","","","95","112","","","","","","18","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BN1GO","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000474428400007","View Full Record in Web of Science"

With its innovative approach to decentralized computation and assets management, the blockchain has not only potential to solve a number of system scalability, reliability, security, and privacy issues, but also to revolutionize software systems development in a way similar to what the Internet did. For example, the integration of the blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) provides a promising new research and development direction that has generated significant research funding and venture capital investments. However, the lack of explanation when it comes to the decisions made by today's AI algorithms is a major drawback with respect to trust in such systems, e.g., deep neural networks do not offer control or reasoning over their internal processes. In this keynote talk, we present the trust issues common to blockchain - IoT - AI systems and their integration. We present some directions for achieving more trustworthy and explainable blockchain - AI - IoT system integration by leveraging features of blockchain, smart contracts, trusted oracles, and decentralized storage. We discuss a framework for complex AI systems in which the decision outcomes are reached based on decentralized consensuses of multiple AI predictors. Finally, we discuss few key application areas with practical use cases.","[Svetinovic, Davor] Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","Khalifa University of Science & Technology","Svetinovic, D (corresponding author), Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.","","","","","","","","0","0","0","0","4","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-2946-4","","","","2019","","","","","","","3","3","","","","","","1","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO7YE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000526061400089","View Full Record in Web of Science"

While current literature mainly focuses on fairness for Bitcoin-like blockchains, little has been done to analyze Tendermint. Tendermint is a blockchain technology that uses a committee-based consensus algorithm, which finds an agreement among a set of block creators (called validators), even if some are malicious. Validators are regularly selected to the committee based on their investments. When a validator does not have enough asset to invest, it can increase it with the help of participants that delegate their assets to the validators (called delegators). In this paper, we implement the default Tendermint model and a Tendermint model for fairness in a multi-agent blockchain simulator where participants are modeled as rational agents who enter or leave the system based on their utility values. We conducted experiments for both models where agents have different investment strategies and with various numbers of delegators. In the light of our experimental evaluation, we observed that while, for both models, the fairness decreases and the system shrinks in the absence of delegators, the fairness increases, and the system expands for the second model in the presence of delegators.","[Lagaillardie, Nicolas; Djari, Mohamed Aimen; Gurcan, Onder] CEA, LIST, Point Courrier 174, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Lagaillardie, Nicolas] Imperial Coll London, London SW7 2AZ, England","CEA; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Imperial College London","Gurcan, O (corresponding author), CEA, LIST, Point Courrier 174, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.","nicolas.lagaillardie@etu.ese.fr; Mohamed-Aimen.DJARI@ca.fr; onder.gurcan@cea.fr","","Lagaillardie, Nicolas/0000-0002-6431-4100; Djari, Mohamed Aimen/0000-0003-0212-8908","","","","","34","3","3","3","6","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2078-2489","","INFORMATION","Information","DEC","2019","10","12","","","","","","","378","10.3390/info10120378","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info10120378","","","14","Computer Science, Information Systems","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Computer Science","KC7FZ","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000507340400019","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A double-spending attack consists in issuing two transactions transferring the same bitcoins. The first transaction, from the fraudster to a merchant, is included in a block of the public chain. The second transaction, from the fraudster to himself, is recorded in a block that integrates a private chain, exact copy of the public chain up to substituting the fraudster-to-merchant transaction by the fraudster-to-fraudster transaction. The double-spending hack is completed once the private chain reaches the length of the public chain, in which case it replaces it. The growth of both chains are modelled by two independent counting processes. The probability distribution of the time at which the malicious chain catches up with the honest chain, or, equivalently, the time at which the two counting processes meet each other, is studied. The merchant is supposed to await the discovery of a given number of blocks after the one containing the transaction before delivering the goods.

The implementation of such concept bring about augmented security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in the work environment dynamics from the current centralized structure to a decentralized, cooperative chain of transactions by encouraging trust and transparency. This paper presents an overview of BC technology and its applications in the AEC industry and its potential integration with the building information ( BIM) process. Furthermore, the study explores how BC technologies can improve the BIM working environment by reinforcing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The paper discusses the fundamental principles of distributed ledgers, their current applications and potential future advances, and their classification based on inherent characteristics of consensus reaching and permission management.

Some researchers predicted the price fluctuations and investigated the risk of cryptocurrency and blockchain network. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study which provides the feasibility information about locations for cryptocurrency investment around the world. This paper aims to provide the aforementioned information to the investors. The proposed methodology is based on Topic modeling along with public opinion mining about cryptocurrencies, blockchain network, bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum. The other cryptocurrencies are not included in the study because of having insufficient relevant data on the social forums. Top locations are identified such as Australia, Denmark, Netherlands, and the USA etc. Apart from that, the public perception and environment feasibility are also determined. Almost 83.7% tweets of Sweden shows positive sentiment for cryptocurrency investment. Which ranks the highest having friendly environment for cryptocurrency investment. Similarly, the UK shows the least positive perception of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology usage. Some of the significant terms are also determined using Topic modeling from public opinions. Such as authorization rules, investment, profit, volatility, and security etc. These terms are almost identified as subtopic for each of the inquired keyword. This shows the mutual relationship among different cryptocurrencies and public's concerns about cryptocurrencies.","[Bibi, Shaista] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan","COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI)","Bibi, S (corresponding author), COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan.","shaista_lifetime@yahoo.com","","","","","","","10","1","1","0","3","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-5933-7","","","","2019","","","","","","","550","552","","10.1145/3297280.3297644","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3297280.3297644","","","3","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BN1NS","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000474685800072","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This paper describes how the profits of banking malware are generated and subsequently laundered, with a particular focus on the use of bitcoins and other digital payment methods. Computers are infected with banking malware via phishing emails, in which people are persuaded in various ways to click on links or open attachments, or via exploit kits, programs that try to find weak spots in the security of computer systems. After infection, bank transfers of the online banking accounts of victims are manipulated via fake website screens (web injects). Behind the screens the amounts and beneficiaries of transactions are modified, emptying the victims' bank accounts. In the next step, the banking malware profits are laundered. In this paper we describe two models that are used in particular (next to more traditional money laundering methods). The first model involves the use of money mules and a quick cash-out. The second model focuses on direct spending via (a) direct purchases of products via online shopping, (b) direct purchases of bitcoins via Bitcoin exchanges or (c) direct purchases of luxury goods. Bitcoins can be further laundered via so-called mixing services. All in all, these methods allow criminals to launder profits in relative anonymity and prevent seizure of the illegal profits.","[Custers, Bart H.

The emergence of blockchain provides a new direction for data protection and data tokenization. Nonetheless, existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin using Proof-of-Work are particularly energy intensive. On the other hand, classical protocols such as Byzantine agreement do not work efficiently in an open environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a permission-less blockchain with a novel double-DAG (directed acyclic graph) architecture called DLattice, where each account has its own Account-DAG and all accounts make up a greater Node-DAG structure. DLattice parallelizes the growth of each account's Account-DAG, each of which is not influenced by other accounts' irrelevant transactions. DLattice uses a new DPoS-BA-DAG(PANDA) protocol to reach consensus among users only when the forks are observed. Based on proposed DLattice, we introduce a process of data tokenization, including data assembling, data anchoring, and data authorization. We implement DLattice and evaluate its performance on 25 ECS virtual machines, simulating up to 500 nodes. The experimental results show that DLattice reaches a consensus in 10 seconds, achieves desired throughput, and incurs almost no penalty for scaling to more users.","[Zhou, Tong; Li, Xiaofeng; Zhao, He] Chinese Acad Sci, Hefei Inst Phys Sci, Hefei 230031, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Tong] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei Inst Phys Sci, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, CAS; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Zhao, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Hefei Inst Phys Sci, Hefei 230031, Anhui, Peoples R China.","zhaoh@hfcas.ac.cn","li, xiaofeng/GXF-9442-2022","Zhao, He/0000-0003-2646-7306; Zhou, Tong/0000-0003-3486-036X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61602435]; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province [1708085QF153]; Major Project of Science and Technology of Anhui Province [16030901057]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province); Major Project of Science and Technology of Anhui Province","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61602435, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province under Grant 1708085QF153, and in part by the Major Project of Science and Technology of Anhui Province under Grant 16030901057.","","33","19","22","3","22","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2019","7","","","","","","39273","39287","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2906637","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2906637","","","15","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","HT0JL","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000464251300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Even when deploying electronic cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, anonymity cannot be fully guaranteed. Also, many anonymous payment schemes suffer from possible double spending circumstances. E-commerce privacy is basically a difficult problem as it involves parties with concurring interests. Three major e-commerce requirements are highly difficult to resolve: anonymous purchase, anonymous delivery and anonymous payment. This work presents a possible e-commerce system addressing all three anonymity requirements for electronic-items business on open networks. The system offers anonymous entities authentication mechanisms up to completing a fair anonymous e-commerce transaction. The system is based on deploying a physically clone-resistant hardware token for each relevant involved party. The tokens are made clone-resistant by accommodating a Secret Unknown Cipher (SUC) in each hardware-token as a digital PUF-like identity. A set of novel generic system-setups for units, protocols and e-commerce schemes is introduced. The proposed anonymization is basically attained by virtually-replacing relevant e-commerce entities by low-cost, unique and clone-resistant tokens/units using SUCs. The units act as trustable anonymous, authenticated and non-replaceable entities monitored by their acting users.","[Mars, Ayoub; Adi, Wael] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Comp & Network Engn, IDA, Braunschweig, Germany","Braunschweig University of Technology","Mars, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Comp & Network Engn, IDA, Braunschweig, Germany.","a.mars@tu-bs.de; w.adi@tu-bs.de","","Mars, Ayoub/0000-0002-7478-1255","","","","","23","0","0","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-953-233-098-4","","","","2019","","","","","","","1226","1231","","","","","","6","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BN5PZ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000484544500219","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The point of this policy change is to hopefully prevent the amount of crime that results from the proliferation of cash. However, there are potential negative consequences to this policy change that receive little to no attention and there are several misconceptions regarding the opportunistic nature and resourcefulness of organized crime. As such, this paper aims to attempt to study these potentially negative consequences to provide some warning to countries adopting a cashless economic policy. Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual paper relying upon an understanding of the literature in the fields of sociology, anthropology, psychology and criminology as applied to the topic of money and economic policy. Findings This paper discusses numerous negative effects to adopting a cashless economic policy, to include the proliferation of underground financing through the hawala system and organized criminal channels, the increased use of Bitcoin, the more difficult task of tracking currency through bank reporting requirements, and the potential effect of increasing other crimes, which are harder to track. Originality/value There have been few if any paper discussing the consequences of cashless economic policies and its implications toward organized crime. This paper is unique in both the subject matter being discussed and the conceptual arguments it puts forth.","[Rivera, Joseph Wilfrido] Univ Florida, Dept Criminol Law & Soc, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Rivera, JW (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Criminol Law & Soc, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.","jrivera29@ufl.edu","Rivera, Joseph W/J-6916-2015","","","","","","19","1","1","2","28","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1758-7808","1368-5201","","J MONEY LAUND CONTRO","J.

The reliability and immutability of blockchains combined with the support for decentralized, trustless data processing offer new opportunities for applications in such domains. However, current blockchain proposals do not support spatio-temporal data processing, and the block-based sequential access in blockchain hinders efficient query processing. We propose spatio-temporal blockchain technology that supports fast query processing. More specifically, we propose blockchain technology that records time and location attributes for the transactions, maintains data integrity, and supports fast spatial queries by the introduction of a cryptographically signed tree data structure, the Merkle Block Space Index (BSI), which is a modification of the Merkle KD-tree. We consider Bitcoin-like near-uniform block generation, and we process temporal queries by means of a block-DAG data structure, called Temporal Graph Search (TGS), without the need for temporal indexes. To enable the experiments, we propose a random graph model to generate a block-DAG topology for an abstract peer-to-peer network.

Academic and non-academic publications on the subject have so far burgeoned mainly in and around the so-called fintech (financial technology) area, a fact that is underlined by a surprisingly high number of literature reviews already performed in this relatively novel area of research. For the public sector and the study domain of Digital Government, Blockchain and DLT have remained under-researched topics, and the number of respective publications is still relatively low. The aim of this meta-level literature study is to map the existing Blockchain and DLT-related body of knowledge and link its prevalent concepts to known needs and requirements studied in the context of the public sector and in Digital Government. Among the concepts, which intersect the existing literature on Blockchain strongly with the public sector-related research and practice, the study found cost reduction, innovation, regulation, taxation, security, privacy, transparency, among others, all of which deserve increased attention from scholars active in the domain of Digital Government research.","[Rodriguez Bolivar, Manuel Pedro] Univ Granada, Fac Business Studies, Dept Accounting & Finance, C Campus Univ Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Scholl, Hans Jochen] Univ Washington, Informat Sch, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","University of Granada; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle","Scholl, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Informat Sch, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.","jscholl@uw.edu","","","","","","","102","6","6","2","22","IOS PRESS","AMSTERDAM","NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1570-1255","1875-8754","","INFORM POLITY","Inf.

However, the PoW consensus mechanism is computation-consuming which obstacles the application of PBN in wireless mobile networks since most Internet of Things/mobile devices (IMDs) are resource limited. Recently, mobile edge computing (MEC) has been regarded as a promising technology which can allow IMDs to offload their computation tasks to the edge nodes. Although IMDs can offload their computation tasks to the edge nodes, there is still lots of competition among enormous solo mining IMDs when reaching consensus. In this paper, we first formulate the computation resource allocation problem of PBN from the viewpoint of coalition game theory under the MEC environment. Then, we propose a coalition formation game-based algorithm to maximize the system sum utility and take both the individual profit of IMD and coalition profit into consideration. Furthermore, we prove the proposed algorithm converges to a Nash-stable partition in a fast convergence rate and finally reaches the near-optimal solution with low computational complexity. The simulation results demonstrate the optimality and convergence of the proposed algorithm, and the proposed algorithm outperforms other schemes in terms of system sum profit and ratio of rewarded IMDs to overall IMDs.","[Zhao, Ning; Wu, Hao; Chen, Yali] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, State Key Lab Rail Traff Control & Safety, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Ning; Chen, Yali] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China","Beijing Jiaotong University; Beijing Jiaotong University","Wu, H (corresponding author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, State Key Lab Rail Traff Control & Safety, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.","n_zhao@bjtu.edu.cn; hwu@bjtu.edu.cn; chenyali@bjtu.edu.cn","","Zhao, Ning/0000-0003-1389-2469; Wu, Hao/0000-0002-4733-0125","State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University [RCS2019ZT006]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2018JBZ102]","State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This work was supported in part by the State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, under Contract RCS2019ZT006, and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant 2018JBZ102.","","34","24","26","5","43","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2327-4662","","","IEEE INTERNET THINGS","IEEE Internet Things J.","OCT","2019","6","5","","","SI","","8507","8518","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2919781","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2019.2919781","","","12","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","JF3OB","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000491295800094","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this paper we propose a definition of ecosystem based on application domains: software systems are in the same ecosystem if they share the same application domain, as described by a similar technological scope, context or objective. As an example, all projects implementing networking capabilities to trade Bitcoin and other virtual currencies can be considered as part of the same cryptocurrency ecosystem. Utilising a sample of 100 Java software systems, we derive their application domains using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) approach. We then evaluate a suite of object-oriented metrics per ecosystem, and test a null hypothesis: 'the OO metrics of all ecosystems come from the same population'. Our results show that the null hypothesis is rejected for most of the metrics chosen: the ecosystems that we extracted, based on application domains, show different structural properties.

The use of cryptocurrency for illicit purposes, especially Bitcoin, is well documented both in academic writing, media reporting and even film documentaries. The infamous SilkRoad marketplace in addition to the millions of dollars spent within dark markets on drugs, guns and assassinations have grabbed the headlines. This paper looks at how blockchain is creating new areas of investigation that are yet to be explored in detail. This scenario-based research examines the hosting of stolen data (P.I.I) personal identifiable information on a distributed blockchain host where the data is also accessible. The platform used is based on Ethereum infrastructure but demonstrates just one available platform that poses the paradigm. The paper examines the considerations through the lens of an incident responder /cyber investigator, forensics examiner and data controller. The scenario highlights distinct differences in considerations from a traditional response compared to dealing with the immutable and unstoppable distributed technology. The paper concludes that more is needed to be done to understand digital forensics in the blockchain era and the need to develop beyond track and trace in the cryptocurrency investigative toolbox. The discussion also brings forth how data retention and GDPR requires consideration when applying it blockchain systems.","[Dyson, Simon F.] NHS Digital, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England","","Dyson, SF (corresponding author), NHS Digital, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.","simon.dyson@protonmail.com","","","","","","","20","0","0","1","1","BRITISH BLOCKCHAIN ASSOC","LONDON","KEMP HOUSE 152-160 CITY RD, LONDON, EC1V 2NX, ENGLAND","","2516-3957","","J BRIT BLOCKCHAIN AS","J.

Local triangle counting in a graph stream is one of the fundamental tasks in graph mining with important applications including anomaly detection, social role identification, community detection, etc. Many recent graph streams include duplicate edges, hence form multigraph streams: e.g., many network packets might have a same (source, destination) pair. Although there have been several local triangle counting methods for multigraph streams, they have problems in terms of accuracy and memory efficiency; furthermore, most methods support either binary or weighted counting, and thus cannot find anomalies whose detection requires both types of counting. In this paper, we propose FURL, a memory-efficient and accurate local triangle counting method for multigraph streams. FURL has two main advantages. First, FURL improves accuracy by (1) reducing the variance of its estimation via a regularization strategy, and (2) sampling more triangles than the state-of-the-art methods do, by using its memory space efficiently. Second, FURL finds anomalies which state-of-the-art methods cannot discover. Experimental results show that FURL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and memory efficiency. Thanks to FURL, we discover interesting anomalies from a Bitcoin network.","[Jung, Minsoo; Lee, Sunmin; Kang, U.] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Lim, Yongsub] MakinaRocks, Seoul, South Korea","Seoul National University (SNU)","Kang, U (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea.","minsoojung@snu.ac.kr; yongsub@makinarocks.ai; smileeesun@snu.ac.kr; ukang@snu.ac.kr","","","AFOSR/AOARD [FA2386-16-1-4044]; Institute for Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT); Institute of Engineering Research at Seoul National University","AFOSR/AOARD(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); Institute for Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT); Institute of Engineering Research at Seoul National University","This work was supported by AFOSR/AOARD under the Grant No. FA2386-16-1-4044.

During each treasury period, project proposals are submitted, discussed, and voted for; top-ranked projects are funded from the treasury. The Dash governance system is a real-world example of such kind of systems. In this work, we, for the first time, provide a rigorous study of the treasury system. We modelled, designed, and implemented a provably secure treasury system that is compatible with most existing blockchain infrastructures, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. More specifically, the proposed treasury system supports liquid democracy/delegative voting for better collaborative intelligence. Namely, the stake holders can either vote directly on the proposed projects or delegate their votes to experts. Its core component is a distributed universally composable secure end-to-end verifiable voting protocol. The integrity of the treasury voting decisions is guaranteed even when all the voting committee members are corrupted. To further improve efficiency, we proposed the world's first honest verifier zero-knowledge proof for unit vector encryption with logarithmic size communication. This partial result may be of independent interest to other cryptographic protocols.

Existing blockchain systems have successfully either resolved the scalability issue by advancing the distributed consensus protocols from the control plane, or complemented the security issue by updating the block structure and encryption algorithms from the data plane. Yet, we argue that the underlying P2P network plane remains as an important but unaddressed barrier for accelerating the overall blockchain system performance. Our key insights from comparative assessments reveal the fact that P2P topology highly affects the broadcast speed of blockchain data, leading to poor performance and vulnerable to double spending attacks. In this paper, we introduce BlockP2P, a novel optimization design to accelerate broadcast efficiency and meanwhile retain the security. BlockP2P first operates the geographical proximity sensing clustering, which leverages K-Means algorithm for gathering proximity peer nodes into clusters. It follows by the hierarchical topological structure that ensures strong connectivity and small diameter based on node attribute classification. We finally propose the parallel spanning tree broadcast algorithm to enable fast data broadcast among nodes both in the intra- and inter- clusters. To clarify the influence of each tier, we carefully design and implement a blockchain network simulator. Evaluation results show that BlockP2P can exhibit promising performance compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum.","[Hao, Weifeng; Zeng, Jiajie; Dai, Xiaohai; Xiao, Jiang; Hua, Qiangsheng; Chen, Hanhua; Jin, Hai] Huazhong Univ Scinece & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Natl Engn Res Ctr Big Data Technol & Syst, Serv Comp Technol & Syst Lab,Cluster & Grid Comp, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Li, Kuan-Ching] Providence Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taichung, Taiwan","Providence University - Taiwan","Xiao, J (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Scinece & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Natl Engn Res Ctr Big Data Technol & Syst, Serv Comp Technol & Syst Lab,Cluster & Grid Comp, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.","jiangxiao@hust.edu.cn","Li, Kuan-Ching/F-4966-2010","Li, Kuan-Ching/0000-0003-1381-4364","","","","","21","9","9","1","11","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-19223-5; 978-3-030-19222-8","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2019","11484","","","","","","223","237","","10.1007/978-3-030-19223-5_16","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-19223-5_16","","","15","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO0TC","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000493300600016","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, there has been a lack of solutions that can support real-time price prediction to cope with high currency volatility, handle massive heterogeneous data volumes, including social media sentiments, while supporting fault tolerance and persistence in real time, and provide real-time adaptation of learning algorithms to cope with new price and sentiment data. In this paper we introduce KryptoOracle, a novel real-time and adaptive cryptocurrency price prediction platform based on Twitter sentiments. The integrative and modular platform is based on (i) a Spark-based architecture which handles the large volume of incoming data in a persistent and fault tolerant way; (ii) an approach that supports sentiment analysis which can respond to large amounts of natural language processing queries in real time; and (iii) a predictive method grounded on online learning in which a model adapts its weights to cope with new prices and sentiments. Besides providing an architectural design, the paper also describes the KryptoOracle platform implementation and experimental evaluation. Overall, the proposed platform can help accelerate decision-making, uncover new opportunities and provide more timely insights based on the available and ever-larger financial data volume and variety.","[Mohapatra, Shubhankar; Ahmed, Nauman; Alencar, Paulo] Univ Waterloo, Cheriton Sch Comp Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada","University of Waterloo","Mohapatra, S (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Cheriton Sch Comp Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada.","shubhankar.mohapatra@uwaterloo.ca; n78ahmed@uwaterloo.ca; palencar@uwaterloo.ca","","","","","","","21","10","10","1","5","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2639-1589","","978-1-7281-0858-2","IEEE INT CONF BIG DA","","","2019","","","","","","","5544","5551","","","","","","8","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP4WK","","Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000554828705087","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The blockchain is a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) solution which has enormous potential as can be seen in the numerous avenues it has been deployed. Simplistically, it is a decentralized database which can revolutionize the current centralized world we live. IoT is the interconnection of devices with mostly bounded resources. IoT applications are also distributed in nature thereby making it inevitable that the paths of the blockchain and IoT will cross in the future. Blockchain's DLT will eventually play a crucial role in how IoT devices will communicate. The Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism was the original consensus technique introduced in the first blockchain based application (Bitcoin). PoW guaranteed consensus in the network by verifying transactions. However, the PoW had deficiencies. The solving of the PoW puzzle is computationally expensive which has become an impediment in the potential marriage of IoT and blockchain. This predicament arises as IoT devices are plagued with limited resources.

Of many applications which can be implemented based on the blockchain, storage is an important one, a notable example of which is the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS is a distributed web based on a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open and focuses on public accessible files. To provide a solution for private file storage in the blockchain way, in this paper we propose a Merkle-tree-based File System (MTFS). In MTFS, the blockchain is more than a trust machine; it is an abstract of a cluster system. Distributed random nodes form a tree network cluster without a central controller to provide a secure private storage service and faster message propagation. Advance proxy re-encryption algorithm is applied to guarantee secure file exchanges under permission. Merkle tree will make sure that the files are distributed among the service nodes in a balanced way. The proposed MTFS can be used not only for personal file storage and exchange but also for industry requiring mutual trust in file uploading and downloading in making contracts like insurances.","[Kan, Jia; Kim, Kyeong Soo] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Suzhou, Peoples R China","Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University","Kan, J (corresponding author), Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Suzhou, Peoples R China.","Jia.Kan17@student.xjtlu.edu.cn; Kyeongsoo.Kim@xjtlu.edu.cn","","","","","","","10","5","5","0","4","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-1328-9","","","","2019","","","","","","","43","47","","","","","","5","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO0IT","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000491257000015","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Superconducting circuits based on Josephson Junctions (JJ) is an emerging technology that provides devices which can be switched with pico-second latencies and consumes two orders of magnitude lower switching energy compared to CMOS. While JJ-based circuits can operate at high frequencies and are energy-efficient, the technology faces three critical challenges: limited device density and lack of area-efficient technology for memory structures, low gate fanout, and new failure modes of Flux-Traps that occurs due to the operating environment. Limited memory density restricts the use of superconducting technology in the near term to application domains that have high compute intensity but require negligible amount of memory. In this paper, we study the use of superconducting technology to build an accelerator for SHA-256 engines commonly used in Bitcoin mining. We show that merely porting existing CMOS-based accelerator to superconducting technology provides 10.6X improvement in energy efficiency. Redesigning the accelerator to suit the unique constraints of superconducting technology (such as low fanout) improves the energy efficiency to 12.2X. We also investigate solutions to make the accelerator tolerant of new fault modes and show how this faulttolerant design can be leveraged to reduce the operating current, thereby improving the overall energy-efficiency to 46X.","[Tannu, Swamit S.; Das, Poulami; Qureshi, Moinuddin K.] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Lewis, Michael L.; Krick, Robert; Carmean, Douglas M.] Microsoft, Redmond, WA USA","University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Microsoft","Tannu, SS (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.","swamit@gatech.edu; moin@gatech.edu","Bhattacharyya, Debnath/A-3144-2016; Technology, Vignan's Institute of Information/AAR-9004-2020; Tannu, Swamit/ABC-6917-2021","Bhattacharyya, Debnath/0000-0003-0140-9644; Technology, Vignan's Institute of Information/0000-0001-5024-4976; Tannu, Swamit/0000-0003-4479-7413","","","","","53","9","9","0","0","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-6685-4","","","","2019","","","","","","","67","75","","10.1145/3310273.3321561","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3310273.3321561","","","9","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BN1NT","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000474686400010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The interest in blockchain has been increasing since its emergence. Hyperledger Fabric is one of the permissioned blockchain frameworks. One of the characteristics of Hyperledger Fabric is it utilizes general-purpose programming languages, e.g., Go, Node.js, and Java, to implement smart contracts (called chaincode in Hyperledger Fabric). The advantages of utilizing these languages are already known to potential developers, and development tools might already exist. However, one of the disadvantages is that these languages were not originally designed for writing smart contracts. Hence, there may be risks that developers do not need to consider when using specific languages such as Solidity of Ethereum. Furthermore, even though development tools exist, how many risks are covered by the tools is an open question. In this paper, we focus on Go language and the tools. First, we surveyed what kind of risks are associated with chaincodes are developed using Go language and observed there are 14 potential risks. Then, we investigated how many risks can be covered by Go tools, e.g., golint and gosec, and a vulnerability detection tool for chaincodes called Chaincode Scanner. From our results, we observed that some risks are not covered by the existing tools. Hence, we develop a detection tool to cover risks by static analysis. Finally, in this paper, we describe how to find the risks with our tool and evaluate the usefulness.","[Yamashita, Kazuhiro; Nomura, Yoshihide] Fujitsu Labs Ltd, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan; [Zhou, Ence; Pi, Bingfeng; Jun, Sun] FUJITSU Res & Dev Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China","Fujitsu Ltd; Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd; Fujitsu Ltd; Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd","Yamashita, K (corresponding author), Fujitsu Labs Ltd, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan.","y-kazuhiro@fujitsu.com; y.nomura@fujitsu.com; zhouence@cn.fujitsu.com; winter.pi@cn.fujitsu.com; sunjung@cn.fujitsu.com","","","","","","","28","68","73","1","11","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-1807-9","","","","2019","","","","","","","1","10","","","","","","10","Computer Science, Software Engineering","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BM8NJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000469455400001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

How to encourage the willingness to cooperate and share information between these entities has always been one of the major challenges in the field of supply chain management. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) can help entities get real-time data in the supply chain to share the key information and reduce costs. However, the supply chain not only needs to know how to gather the data but also ensures that the data processed is not leaked. Since Blockchain, as the main technology of Bitcoin, has the advantages of traceability and anti-counterfeiting, blockchain is the right tool to tackle the date sharing problem in supply chain. In this paper, we connect IIoT devices to the blockchain by combining the monitoring and recording of IIoT devices and storing real-time data in the network by smart contract. In addition, a blockchain-based supply chain structure is proposed. This structure provides collaboration solutions between different entities in the supply chain. In this structure, a fine-grained data sharing scheme for supply chain is proposed. By setting access policies to the smart contract, only the companies that satisfy the attributes of access policies can execute the smart contract and view the details of the transaction. The proposed scheme ensures reliability of data in the supply chain, and the privacy protection of the chain.","[Wen, Quansi; Gao, Ying; Chen, Zhiling] South China Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Gangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wu, Dapeng] Univ Florida Ginesville, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Gainesville, FL USA","South China University of Technology","Wen, QS (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Gangzhou, Peoples R China.","quansiwen@ieee.org; gaoying@scut.edu.cn; czlbanban@foxmail.com; dpwu@ieee.org","","Wu, Dapeng/0000-0003-1755-0183","Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2018A030313351]; Industrial Internet Innovation and Development Project in 2018 Grant [MIZ1824020]; Key Lab of Information Network Security, Ministry of Public Security","Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Industrial Internet Innovation and Development Project in 2018 Grant; Key Lab of Information Network Security, Ministry of Public Security","Ying Gao is the corresponding author.

In this article, we start from the current distinction between different types of tokens and argue that it can create confusion and should be at least partially abandoned. We believe that the conceptual difference between a currency token and a tradable utility token is just the dimension of the crypto environment in which the token is spent. More specifically, 'utility tokens' combine the customer payment mechanism with the utility component and, when tradable on a secondary market, the investment one. We argue that they blur the traditional distinctions between currencies, financial assets and consumption goods. Moreover, we stress the increasing importance of online crypto exchanges. Recently some exchanges have also taken up the role of trusted intermediaries and staked their reputation on token offerings, which are termed initial exchange offerings and have gained in popularity. We therefore argue that the crypto market increasingly looks like a segment of the capital market and behaves as such. Given that tokens have a clear investment component, we show that they are tradable securities under the Prospectus Regulation. We compare the European securities regulation with its US counterpart and focus on prospectus exemptions, highlighting the great differences between Europe and the US which make Europe less amicable to blockchain startups.","[Boreiko, Dmitri; Giudici, Paolo] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Sch Econ & Management, Bolzano, Italy; [Ferrarini, Guido] Univ Genoa, Dept Law, Genoa, Italy; [Ferrarini, Guido; Giudici, Paolo] ECGI, Brussels, Belgium","Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Genoa; European Corporate Governance Institute","Giudici, P (corresponding author), Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Sch Econ & Management, Bolzano, Italy.;Giudici, P (corresponding author), ECGI, Brussels, Belgium.","dmitri.boreiko@unibz.it; guido.ferrarini@giuri.unige.it; paolo.giudici@unibz.it","","","","","","","59","12","12","4","41","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","1566-7529","1741-6205","","EUR BUS ORGAN LAW RE","Eur.

NeoVM is a turing-complete computing machine, designed for Neo Blockchain, specially designed for cryptographic and deterministic (verifiable) computation. A NeoVM program is called a NVM Script (or just Script), and it is often used together with Neo Blockchain application capabilities, being called a Smart Contract. Smart Contracts are already used on other blockchains such as Bitcoin (although not Turing-complete) for value transfers, through the availability of verifiable information, i.e., transactions and transaction blocks, on a global ledger. However, due to the high processing costs and low throughput capabilities of global public chains, most industrial applications of blockchain require the usage of private/permissioned chains, with the goal of providing high-speed and low-cost information persistance. This work proposes an IoT device prototype capable of delivering blockchain private access to home applications (also called a Smart Home), in a new concept defined as Home Ledger. Applications of Home Ledger include: local permissioned access to sensors and home devices (through state-of-the-art cryptography); guaranteed verification of local stored data (through redundancy and byzantine fault tolerance consensus mechanisms); low-cost and high-performance local registry (through usage of low-energy microcontrollers); auditable cameras and local security on Home Ledger; global availability by interfacing with a global public ledger.","[da Silva, Vanessa Fernandes; Coelho, Igor Machado] Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, IME, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Coelho, Mateus Nazario] Univ Fed Ouro Preto, Dept Engn Controle & Automacao, Ouro Preto, Brazil; [Coelho, Bruno Nazario] Univ Fed Sao Joao del Rei, Dept Technol DTECH, Ouro Branco, Brazil; [Coelho, Vitor Nazario] OptBlocks, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil","Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto; Universidade Federal de Sao Joao del-Rei","da Silva, VF (corresponding author), Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, IME, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.","vanessa.fernandes.silva@hotmail.com; mateus.nazario@yahoo.com.br; brunocoelho@ufsj.edu.br; vncoelho@gmail.com; igor.machado@ime.uerj.br","Coelho, Bruno Nazario/ABG-8804-2020","Coelho, Bruno Nazario/0000-0002-2809-7778","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) [001]; Brazilian funding agency CNPq; Brazilian funding agency FAPERJ; open community group NeoResearch","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Brazilian funding agency CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Brazilian funding agency FAPERJ(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)); open community group NeoResearch","This study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001.

Blockchain continues to evolve and new features and capabilities are developed continuously. Although the use of the technology started in cryptocurrency (specifically, Bitcoin), it has expanded to other areas that can benefit from a shared, secure, ledger. This article investigates the potential impact of blockchain technology on the accounting profession. This article analyzes data security and privacy considerations, technology, adoption, and implementation considerations, and some considerations that relate specifically to accounting and auditing. We find that the unique needs of an accounting information system may not be a good match for blockchain as it currently exists. While we explain that blockchain may deliver many benefits, particularly in the areas of data reliability and the financial statement audit, we identify several factors, which raise significant questions about whether blockchain will ever be significantly integrated in the accounting function. Chief among those concerns is the scalability of the technology at an acceptable cost. While significant investment has and will be made for further development of blockchain business applications, it is our assessment that proponents of blockchain integration in accounting have not yet made the economic case for it. We also have significant concerns about whether blockchain technology can adequately address risks associated with data security and privacy. Addressing all these issues will be a minimum requirement for gaining widespread acceptance by firms and their accountants.","[Fuller, Stephen H.; Markelevich, Ariel] Suffolk Univ, Sawyer Business Sch, Accounting Dept, Boston, MA 02108 USA","Suffolk University","Markelevich, A (corresponding author), Suffolk Univ, 120 Tremt St,Off 5341, Boston, MA 02108 USA.","amarkelevich@suffolk.edu","","Fuller, Stephen/0000-0001-7591-7778","","","","","36","11","12","13","58","WILEY PERIODICALS, INC","SAN FRANCISCO","ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA","1044-8136","1097-0053","","J CORP ACCOUNT FINAN","J.

The resulting code is verified to be safe (no overflow, no use after free), correct (parsing is the inverse of serialization) and non-malleable (each message has a unique binary representation). These guarantees underpin the security of cryptographic message authentication, and they enable testing to focus on interoperability and performance issues. EverParse consists of two parts: LowParse, a library of parser combinators and their formal properties written in F-star; and QuackyDucky, a compiler from a domain-specific language of RFC message formats down to low-level F-star code that calls LowParse. While LowParse is fully verified, we do not formalize the semantics of the input language and keep QuackyDucky outside our trusted computing base. Instead, it also outputs a formal message specification, and F-star automatically verifies our implementation against this specification. EverParse yields efficient zero-copy implementations, usable both in F-star and in C. We evaluate it in practice by fully implementing the message formats of the Transport Layer Security standard and its extensions (TLS 1.0-1.3, 293 datatypes) and by integrating them into MITLS, an F-star implementation of TLS. We illustrate its generality by implementing the Bitcoin block and transaction formats, and the ASN.1 DER payload of PKCS 1 RSA signatures. We integrate them into C applications and measure their runtime performance, showing significant improvements over prior handwritten libraries.","[Ramananandro, Tahina; Delignat-Lavaud, Antoine; Fournet, Cedric; Swamy, Nikhil; Protzenko, Jonathan] Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA 98052 USA; [Chajed, Tej] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kobeissi, Nadim] Inria Paris, Paris, France","Microsoft; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)","Ramananandro, T (corresponding author), Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA 98052 USA.","","","","","","","","49","14","14","0","0","USENIX ASSOC","BERKELEY","SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA","","","978-1-939133-06-9","","","","2019","","","","","","","1465","1482","","","","","","18","Computer Science, Information Systems","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO3AB","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000509775000084","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Since then, blockchain technology has many more advancements that are being developed and experimented. In particular, recent blockchain platforms such as Ethereum offer general and executable scripts, namely smart contracts, that can be employed to develop decentralized applications (DApps) in many domains beyond payment. However, the transparency of blockchain data raises concerns for many applications that require high privacy level. Therefore, many privacy enhancing technologies have been applied to DApp development, including zero knowledge proof (ZKP). This paper focuses on a particular kind of ZKP, called zero knowledge range proof (ZKRP), that has been applied in blockchain-based payments for banks. ZKRP allows a user to convince other people that a secret value actually lies within an interval without revealing any information about the secret. Here we introduce a new ZKRP which has the following remarkable features: (1) Non-interactive: No communication is required between a user and a verifier during the proof. (2) Range-flexibility: There is no limitation on the lower bound and the upper bound of the range except that they are natural numbers. (3) Efficiency: Our scheme is modified from that of Pang et al. (2010), yet achieves better security and is more efficient than their scheme. We believe our new ZKRP can be beneficial to the development of DApps and can extend the application scope to more scenarios.","[Tsai, Ya-Che; Tso, Raylin; Liu, Zi-Yuan; Chen, Kung] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chen, Kung] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Management Informat Syst, Taipei, Taiwan","National Chengchi University; National Chengchi University","Tsai, YC (corresponding author), Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.","106753028@nccu.edu.tw; raylin@cs.nccu.edu.tw; 105753036@nccu.edu.tw; chenk@cs.nccu.edu.tw","","Liu, Zi-Yuan/0000-0001-7164-088X","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (ROC) [MOST 107-2218-E-004-001, MOST 105-2221-E-004-001-MY3]; Taiwan Information Security Center at National Sun Yat-sen University (TWISC@NSYSU)","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (ROC)(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Taiwan Information Security Center at National Sun Yat-sen University (TWISC@NSYSU)","This research was partially supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (ROC), under Project Numbers MOST 107-2218-E-004-001, MOST 105-2221-E-004-001-MY3, and by Taiwan Information Security Center at National Sun Yat-sen University (TWISC@NSYSU).","","23","6","6","3","9","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-1264-0","","","","2019","","","","","","","129","134","","10.1109/DAPPCON.2019.00025","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DAPPCON.2019.00025","","","6","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO1XR","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000502835000015","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In recent years Russia have been realizing the Program named the Strategy for Information Society development, therefore, it is worth to study Chinese experience in legal regulation of a digital area. One of the urgent issues for Russia is the regulation of relations concerning cryptocurrency and attraction of investments via initial coin offering (ICO). The PRC is already carrying out legal regulation of this sphere. Thus, through comparative legal research, the paper aims to find the key features of the Chinese approach on regulation a cryptocurrency and ICO. An analysis of the Chinese legal acts has showed that the Central Bank of the PRC banned financing through the ICO, because of high degree of its use for illegal financing and speculations. In this regard, the position of the Chinese legislator on the prohibition of ICO conducted without permission on it helps to prevent the raising of financial pyramids. Basing on ideas of Chinese researchers on the issue, the author concludes that the PRC banned ICO till elaboration legislation allowing to establish strict control on it. Such a regulation should be elaborated on the base of to the Law on securities because of lots of similarities of ICO and emission of securities. The prohibition of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrency exchange in the PRC applies only to banks and financial organizations and aims to prevent the uncontrolled withdrawal of capital from the country, illegal funding and the legalization of proceeds from crime, as well as to protect the financial sector from manipulation. At the same time, individuals in China are not prohibited from owning a cryptocurrency, but the requirements of the People's Bank of China establish the obligation to disclose the identity of such citizens, which reduces the risks of illegal transactions. The author concludes this experience of the PRC can be applied in Russia for creation of its legal regulation in digital sphere.","[Alekseenko, A.

In most instances, the main cost comes from the required amount of energy for the Proof-of-Work, and this cost is inherent to the design. In addition, useless costs from discarded work (e.g., the so-called Forks) and lack of scalability (in number of users and in rapid transactions) limit their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we present an innovative scheme which eliminates the nonce and thus the burden of the Proof-of-Work which is the main cause of the energy waste in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. We prove that our scheme guarantees a tunable and bounded average number of simultaneous mining whatever the size of the population in competition, thus by making the use of nonce-based techniques unnecessary, achieves scalability without the cost of consuming a large volume of energy. The technique used in the proof of our scheme is based on the analogy of the analysis of a green leader election. The additional difference with Proof-of-Work schemes (beyond the suppression of the nonce field that is triggering most of the waste), is the introduction of empty blocks which aim are to call regular blocks following a staircase set of values. Our scheme reduces the risk of Forks and provides tunable scalability for the number of users and the speed of block generation.","[Jacquet, Philippe] Nokia Bell Labs, Paris, France; [Mans, Bernard] Macquarie Univ, N Ryde, NSW, Australia","Nokia Corporation; Macquarie University","Jacquet, P (corresponding author), Nokia Bell Labs, Paris, France.","philippe.jacquet@nokia-bell-labs.com; bernard.mans@mq.edu.au","","Mans, Bernard/0000-0001-7897-2043","","","","","20","2","2","1","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2159-4228","","978-1-7281-1878-9","IEEE CONF COMPUT","","","2019","","","","","","","210","215","","","","","","6","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BO7XY","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000526051100036","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, even at the entry level, cryptocurrency users need to deal with the complex task of key management. In this paper, we propose a simple way to manage a user's private key, under a reasonable assumption that the user has two devices at his disposal (say a laptop and a mobile phone). We refer to our strategy as key splitting. Since these cryptographic keys are used for generating digital signatures, we should take a closer look at the signature schemes that would perform best under key splitting. At the operational level, scalability is one of the main challenges faced by the users and developers. While there are fundamental issues like consensus that challenge scalability, we focus on the computational efficiency in a block formation. Aggregation of signatures is one of the effective solutions to this problem. To this end, we observe that none of the existing signature schemes work well for BOTH key splitting and aggregation. The current popular schemes such as the ones used in Bitcoin or Schnorr's scheme implemented over Elliptic curves are neither suitable for aggregation nor can their keys be split in a convenient and meaningful way. A detailed theoretical and empirical analysis shows that the BLS short signature scheme is best suited for achieving both key splitting and aggregation.","[Selvi, S.

In this protocol, miners seek to extend the longest chain by solving blockhash-based cryptographic puzzles and the required time is probabilistically determined. Therefore, the distribution of the time interval affects security, performance and applications which utilize the block height information. Some researchers assumed that the time follows an exponential distribution but this assumption requires that the blockchain network is fully synchronized. To overcome this unreal scenario, the bounded delay model, in which there is an upper bound for block propagation delay on the network, was proposed. However, it is difficult to calculate the upper bound without observing delay and bandwidth on real-world network links. To solve this problem, we proposed another method to analyze the distribution of the longest chain growth time interval by using the observed fork rate. We derived a closed-form lower bound for the CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function) of the time to update the global block height. We also obtained the Pearson distance which can be used as the metric to judge whether the network is approximately synchronous or not. Finally, we conducted network simulations for comparing our lower bound with the lower bound that is based on the bounded delay model. In numerical examples, we show how the block size affects these lower bounds.","[Seike, Hirotsugu; Koshizuka, Noboru] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Interdisciplinary Informat Studies, Tokyo, Japan; [Aoki, Yasukazu] Picolab Co LTD, Tokyo, Japan; [Koshizuka, Noboru] YRP Ubiquitous Networking Lab, Tokyo, Japan","University of Tokyo","Seike, H (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Interdisciplinary Informat Studies, Tokyo, Japan.","hirotsugu.seike@koshizuka-lab.org; aoki@picolab.jp; noboru@koshizuka-lab.org","","","","","","","18","3","3","0","0","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-4693-5","","","","2019","","","","","","","253","260","","10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00040","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00040","","","8","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO8PX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000528931600031","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It is composed of a peer-to-peer network, used to transfer raw information data. Some of the links in the peer-to-peer network are identified as payment channels, used to conduct payments between two Lightning Network clients (i.e., the two nodes of the channel). Payment channels are created with a fixed credit amount, the channel capacity. The channel capacity, together with the IP address of the nodes, is published to allow a routing algorithm to find an existing path between two nodes that do not have a direct payment channel. However, to preserve users' privacy, the precise balance of the pair of nodes of a given channel (i.e. the bandwidth of the channel in each direction), is kept secret. Since balances are not announced, second-layer nodes probe routes iteratively, until they find a successful route to the destination for the amount required, if any. This feature makes the routing discovery protocol less efficient but preserves the privacy of channel balances. In this paper, we present an attack to disclose the balance of a channel in the Lightning Network. Our attack is based on performing multiple payments ensuring that none of them is finalized, minimizing the economical cost of the attack. We present experimental results that validate our claims, and countermeasures to handle the attack.","[Herrera-Joancomarti, Jordi; Navarro-Arribas, Guillermo; Perez-Sola, Cristina] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Cybercat, Barcelona, Spain; [Ranchal-Pedrosa, Alejandro; Garcia-Alfaro, Joaquin] Inst Polytech Paris, CNRS, SAMOVAR, Telecom SudParis, Paris, France","Autonomous University of Barcelona; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite","Herrera-Joancomarti, J (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Cybercat, Barcelona, Spain.","jordi.herrera@uab.cat; guillermo.navarro@uab.cat; ranchal@telecom-sudparis.eu; cperezsola@uoc.edu; jgalfaro@ieee.org","Garcia-Alfaro, Joaquin/A-4500-2008; Navarro-Arribas, Guillermo/AFP-6074-2022; Herrera-Joancomarti, Jordi/B-8627-2009","Garcia-Alfaro, Joaquin/0000-0002-7453-4393; Navarro-Arribas, Guillermo/0000-0003-3535-942X; Herrera-Joancomarti, Jordi/0000-0002-4935-4681","BART (Blockchain Advanced Research & Technologies) initiative; Cyber CNI chair of the Institut Mines-Telecom; H2020 SPARTA project [830892]; Spanish Government [RTI2018095094-B-C22 CONSENT, TIN2014-57364-C2-2-R SMARTGLACIS]","BART (Blockchain Advanced Research & Technologies) initiative; Cyber CNI chair of the Institut Mines-Telecom; H2020 SPARTA project; Spanish Government(Spanish GovernmentEuropean Commission)","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the BART (Blockchain Advanced Research & Technologies) initiative (cf. http://bart-blockchain.fr/), as well as the Cyber CNI chair of the Institut Mines-Telecom and the H2020 SPARTA project, under grant agreement 830892, and the Spanish Government, under grants RTI2018095094-B-C22 CONSENT and TIN2014-57364-C2-2-R SMARTGLACIS.

The state variable is the amount of wealth invested in the risky asset, while the control variable is the share rate. This formulation has two advantages. First, it provides a portfolio where the optimality is obtained by minimizing the probability of large changes in the portfolio composition with consequently low frictions, while allowing for an explicit solution to the optimal control problem. Second, with this formulation, it can be proven that this optimal solution is the optimal solution of the frictionless Merton problem for corrected price dynamics. The corrected dynamics shows that the market friction increases the risk premium by an additional term that is an elementary function of the risk associated with the market frictions, as well the price of the risk, which also depends on the risk aversion of the investor. In addition, the corrected dynamics supports the existence of a shadow price in friction markets as already shown in Kallsen and Muhle-Karbe (2010).

However, it also gives incentive to malicious users who would like to break the system or take advantage of it (steal money, hide some information stored in the ledger, isolate a particular node from the rest of the network, etc.). Thus, our research focuses on overcoming potential attacks to distributed ledgers. In this paper, we focus on attacks that damage underlying networks of distributed ledgers. Underlying networks offer useful communication primitives such as an atomic broadcast, however such attacks may degrade the property of the primitives and make distributed ledgers relying on the primitives no longer work. Hence we should design algorithms to make the distributed ledgers still work even when some attacks degrade the primitives. As the first study of this problem, we consider distributed ledgers that rely on an atomic broadcast to maintain consistency. We define different cases of attacks affecting the uniform agreement property of the atomic broadcast: We first assume that a single server can fail to deliver a particular message and then we assume that several servers can fail to deliver the message. Afterwards, we present an algorithm to recover the states of the servers that fail to deliver some messages, and consider the situation where the maximum of servers which keep a wrong sequence is known and bounded.","[Benassy, Gregory; Ooshita, Fukuhito; Inoue, Michiko] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Ikoma, Japan; [Benassy, Gregory] Telecom SudParis, Evry, France","Nara Institute of Science & Technology; IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; Institut Polytechnique de Paris","Benassy, G (corresponding author), Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Ikoma, Japan.;Benassy, G (corresponding author), Telecom SudParis, Evry, France.","gregory.benassy@telecom-sudparis.eu; f-oosita@is.naist.jp; kounoe@is.naist.jp","Inoue, Michiko/AAX-8442-2021","","JSPS KAKENHI [18K11167]; JST SICORP [JPMJSC1806]","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); JST SICORP","This work was supported in part by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 18K11167 and JST SICORP Grant Number JPMJSC1806.","","11","1","1","0","0","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-5268-4","","","","2019","","","","","","","195","200","","10.1109/CANDARW.2019.00042","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CANDARW.2019.00042","","","6","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BO9WZ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000532701200035","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Consequently consortiums are exploring private blockchains to keep their membership and transactions private. However, private blockchains do not provide adequate protection against potential collusion by consortium members to revert the state of the blockchain. To countenance this, the private blockchain state may be pinned to a tamper resistant public blockchain. Existing solutions offering pinning to the public blockchain would reveal the transaction rate of the private blockchain, and do not provide a mechanism to contest the validity of a pin. Moreover, they require that all transactions and members of the private blockchain be revealed. These challenges are hampering the wider adoption of private blockchain technology. We describe the primary author's `Anonymous State Pinning approach', which overcomes these limitations and present a security proof to demonstrate pins can be challenged without compromising these properties. We perform a gas cost analysis of the implementation to estimate the operating cost of this technology, which shows that pinning a private blockchain at the rate of one pin per hour would cost US$508 per year. A hierarchical pinning approach is proposed which would allow many private blockchains to pin to a management blockchain which would then pin to Ethereum MainNet. This approach saves money, but at the cost of increased finality times.","[Robinson, Peter; Brainard, John] ConsenSys, Protocol Engn Grp & Syst, Brooklyn, NY 11206 USA; [Robinson, Peter] Univ Queensland, Sch Informat Technol & Elect Engn, St Lucia, Qld, Australia","University of Queensland","Robinson, P (corresponding author), ConsenSys, Protocol Engn Grp & Syst, Brooklyn, NY 11206 USA.;Robinson, P (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Informat Technol & Elect Engn, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.","peter.robinson@consensys.net; john.brainard@consensys.net","","","","","","","23","1","1","1","1","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","2324-9013","","978-1-7281-2776-7","IEEE TRUST BIG","","","2019","","","","","","","827","834","","10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00120","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00120","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP8TQ","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000567324100098","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Such pools can misbehave by strategically withhold found solutions (i.e., blocks). It has been shown that the reward of a large malicious mining pool can be significantly increased by deviating from the honest mining strategy. Moreover, a malicious pool can launch the block withholding (BWH) attack making the target's pool reward system unfair by letting malicious participants receive unearned shares while pretending to contribute work. Although these attacks are well-known, they are usually investigated in a simplified static reward model. This paper gives a detailed analysis of the dynamic reward of the BWH attacker while considering a more realistic model with the computing power changing incessantly. We propose a novel attack called the intermittent block withholding (IBWH) attack and we prove that this attack is optimal in our model. IBWH is a strategy where an attacker influences the reward period time, consequently enlarging the reward rate. Furthermore, in our model, we include the dynamics of the Bitcoin network's computing power, and even with the changing attacker's reward rates, we show that the IBWH's reward rate remains optimal. We consider both the selfish mining attack and the fork after withholding (FAW) attack, and we show that these attacks do not outperform IBWH.","[Ke, Junming] Shandong Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Szalachowski, Pawel; Zhou, Jianying; Yang, Zheng] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Singapore, Singapore; [Xu, Qiuliang] Shandong Univ, Sch Software, Jinan, Peoples R China","Shandong University; Singapore University of Technology & Design; Shandong University","Xu, QL (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Sch Software, Jinan, Peoples R China.","junmingke1994@gmail.com; pawel@sutd.edu.sg; jianying_zhou@sutd.edu.sg; xql@sdu.edu.cn; zheng_yang@sutd.edu.sg","Yang, Zheng/AAE-6121-2021","Zhou, Jianying/0000-0003-0594-0432","SUTD start-up research grant [SRG-ISTD-2017-124]; MOE AcRF Tier 2 grant [MOE2018-T2-1-111]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61872051, 61572294, 61632020]","SUTD start-up research grant(Singapore University of Technology & Design); MOE AcRF Tier 2 grant; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The first author's work was done during his internship in SUTD supported by the SUTD start-up research grant SRG-ISTD-2017-124.

Design/methodology/approach This study uses a combination of visual data representations and the classic Fama and Macbeth (1973) two-pass procedure regressions. Findings The findings show that cryptocurrencies can be a more effective hedge against FX risks as compared to other common hedging instruments and/or techniques such as gold or a diversified currency portfolio. Research limitations/implications - The conclusions were arrived at based only on a small group of cryptocurrency, i.e. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple. Other cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin or ZCash might exhibit different properties. Practical implications - Cryptocurrencies can be cost-effective and cost-efficient instruments that provide a solid hedge for investors and/or firms that are exposed to global FX volatility. Its ease of trade and virtually zero barriers to entry makes it an easily accessible alternative hedge instrument as compared to more complex items such as derivatives. Originality/value If cryptocurrencies are to be accepted into mainstream usage, a detailed examination of its various uses is necessary. In particular, as they are often touted to be the future of currency, its properties and price behavior relative to other mainstream financial instruments need to be well-understood, not only by finance professionals but also by laypersons.","[Cheong, Calvin W.

Following the explosion of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, blockchain solutions are being deployed in almost every aspect of transactional operations as a means to safely exchange digital assets between non-trusted parties. At the heart of every blockchain deployment is the consensus protocol, which maintains the consistency of the blockchain upon satisfying incoming transactions. Although many consensus protocols have been recently introduced, the most prevalent is Proof-of-Work, which scales the blockchain globally by converting the consensus problem to a competition based on cryptographic hash functions; a process called mining. The Proof-of-Work consensus protocol employs memory hard algorithms in order to counteract ASIC or FPGA mining that may compromise the decentralization and democratization of the blockchain. Unfortunately, this leads to increased power consumption and scalability challenges since numerous processing units such as GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs, are required to satisfy the ever-increasing operational requirements of blockchain deployments. In this paper, we perform an in-depth performance analysis and characterization of the most common memory-hard PoW algorithms running on NVIDIA GPUs. Motivated by our experimental findings, we apply a series of optimizations on Ethash algorithm, the consensus protocol of the Ethereum blockchain. The implemented optimizations accelerate performance by 14% and improve energy efficiency by 10% when executing on three NVIDIA GPUs. As a result, the optimized Ethash algorithm outperformed its fastest commercial implementation.","[Han, Runchao; Foutris, Nikos; Kotselidis, Christos] Univ Manchester, Sch Comp Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England","University of Manchester","Han, RC (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Comp Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England.","runchao.han@student.manchester.ac.uk; nikos.foutris@manchester.ac.uk; christos.kotselidis@manchester.ac.uk","",", Nikos/0000-0002-1084-4990","EU [780245, 732366, 754337]","EU(European Commission)","We thank Dr. Foivos S.

We analyze the protocols, software types, popularity and uptime of these services by collecting a large amount of.onion addresses. Websites are crawled and clustered based on their respective language. In order to also determine the amount of unique websites a de -duplication approach is implemented. To achieve this, we introduce a modular system for the real-time detection and analysis of onion services. Address resolution of onion services is realized via descriptors that are published to and requested from servers on the Tor network that volunteer for this task. We place a set of 20 volunteer servers on the Tor network in order to collect.onion addresses. The analysis of the collected data and its comparison to previous research provides new insights into the current state of Tor onion services and their development. The service scans show a vast variety of protocols with a significant increase in the popularity of anonymous mail servers and Bitcoin clients since 2013. The popularity analysis shows that the majority of Tor client requests is performed only for a small subset of addresses. The overall data reveals further that a large amount of permanent services provide no actual content for Tor users. A significant part consists instead of bots, services offered via multiple domains, or duplicated websites for phishing attacks. The total amount of onion services is thus significantly smaller than current statistics suggest.","[Steinebach, Martin; Karakuz, Alexander; Brandl, Katharina; Yannikos, York] Fraunhofer SIT, Darmstadt, Germany; [Schafer, Marcel] Fraunhofer USA, Ctr Expt Software Engn, Riverdale, CA USA","Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Fraunhofer Institute Center Schloss Birlinghoven","Steinebach, M (corresponding author), Fraunhofer SIT, Darmstadt, Germany.","steinebach@sit.fraunhofer.de; mschaefer@cese.fraunhofer.org","","","Federal Ministry of Education and Research [13N14355, 13N14356]","Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","The joint project PANDA on which this publication is based was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research under the funding codes 13N14355 and 13N14356.

In this paper, we lay out an architecture for incorporating a concept similar to Blockchain the technology that underpins the cryptocurrency Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies to provide decentralized security and privacy for loT devices. Currently, the issue with most loT devices is that they lack the processing power, storage and computational overhead to run consensus algorithms to be an active part of the Blockchain network The current issue with the blockchain on the other hand, is its low scalability and low number of transactions per second. We present an innovative approach using a technology called IOTA. This addresses some of the most important problems with existing blockchain infrastructure such as being able to run on lightweight devices with constrained memory. We eliminate transaction fees and the concept of mining which requires a large amount of processing power to compete with other miners. IOTA's main component is the Tangle, a guided acyclic graph (DAG) for transaction storage. We discuss creation of two IoT applications on the tangle - a smart utility meter system and a smart car transaction system which are connected to internet through Low Power Wide Area IoT networks.","[Shabandri, Bilal] Amity Univ Dubai, Dept Elect & Telecommun, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Maheshwari, Piyush] Amity Univ Dubai, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Dubai, U Arab Emirates","","Shabandri, B (corresponding author), Amity Univ Dubai, Dept Elect & Telecommun, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.","bilal.fas@gmail.com; pmaheshwari@amityuniversity.ae","","","","","","","27","31","31","1","4","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-1380-7","","","","2019","","","","","","","1069","1075","","","","","","7","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BM9DX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000470844100206","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Assuming that one-way functions exist, we prove that there is 2-player zero-sum computational game G such that, for all n, the size of the action space in G(n) is polynomial in n and the utility function in G(n) is computable in time polynomial in n, and yet there is no epsilon-Nash equilibrium if players are restricted to using strategies computable by polynomial-time Turing machines, where we use a notion of Nash equilibrium that is tailored to computational games. We also show that an epsilon-Nash equilibrium may not exist if players are constrained to perform at most T computational steps in each of the games in the sequence. On the other hand, we show that if players can use arbitrary Turing machines to compute their strategies, then every computational game has an epsilon-Nash equilibrium. These results may shed light on competitive settings where the availability of more running time or faster algorithms can lead to a computational arms race, precluding the existence of equilibrium.

I.e., there are no further contributors, but the chain itself as data continues to exit on some (or many) storage mediums. What the scenarios for a blockchain to end and the consequences of this are, is discussed in this paper. It also provides ideas how a blockchain could prepare for its end or be transferred to another blockchain. In essence, how can the content of a blockchain remain secure, even if it has stopped growing, or under what circumstances can which attacks be avoided? While blockchains already did die in the past, this was typically of no consequence, as they were of little importance and all interest in them was lost since then. But if it would be used for instance to document land ownership or the financial history of persons/companies like a bank account, the content will be of interest much later and must exist and remain unchanged. Should e.g. bitcoin cease growing at some point, tax authorities might be interested in it for many years; and courts might investigate the content for decades, e.g. as evidence for money laundering or spending illegally obtained money.","[Sonntag, Michael] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Networks & Secur, Linz, Austria","Johannes Kepler University Linz","Sonntag, M (corresponding author), Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Networks & Secur, Linz, Austria.","michael.sonntag@ins.jku.at","","","","","","","5","0","0","0","1","TRAUNER VERLAG","LINZ","KOGLSTR 14, 4020 LINZ, AUSTRIA","","","978-3-99062-590-3","SCHRIFTEN INFORMATIK","","","2019","48","","","","","","311","317","","","","","","7","Business; Economics; Management","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics","BQ8HP","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000620326700034","View Full Record in Web of Science"

While EDM and LA can provide important information that help enhance the quality of teaching and learning, it has become critical to ensure data privacy and student agency over data. In this paper, we introduce Kratos: an immutable and publicly verifiable data management system that enables EDM and LA, while maintaining data privacy and empowering students with a user interface for data governance and participation in school processes. The system aims to achieve data interoperability, which facilitates EDM and LA as incentives to educational stakeholders (policy makers, educators, developers of education technologies, etc.), while prioritizing student agency over their data. Our system gives students and schools an immutable log along with comprehensive access to data that is otherwise scattered across systems and vendors. The underlying set of rules of the system are defined in a set of smart contracts, codified from existing non virtual agreements [1] between schools and education technology (edutech) vendors. We propose the smart contracts to be deployed on a public blockchain (like Ethereum or Bitcoin), for notarizing and time-stamping various interactions which users of Kratos may have with data Third parties requesting access to school data have a unique virtual token assigned to them on the blockchain which helps keep track of data modifications, access and use.","[Hillman, Velislava] Kratos Educ, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA; [Ganesh, Varunram] MIT, Media Lab, Digital Currency Initiat, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)","Hillman, V (corresponding author), Kratos Educ, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA.","vhillman@kratos-education.org; ganeshv@mit.edu","","Hillman, Velislava/0000-0002-3661-0914","Cambridge Public School district; Student Data Privacy Consortium; Access for Learning (SIF)","Cambridge Public School district; Student Data Privacy Consortium; Access for Learning (SIF)","We thank Cambridge Public School district, Student Data Privacy Consortium, and Access for Learning (SIF) for their support, constant, and timely feedback.","","30","5","5","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2639-1589","","978-1-7281-0858-2","IEEE INT CONF BIG DA","","","2019","","","","","","","5754","5762","","","","","","9","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP4WK","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000554828705115","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The first solution launched in Kenya in 2007, M-PESA is one of the world major mobile money services. Mobile money becomes the new monopoly of MMOs in an economic system where the rate of unbanked adults is very high. Currently in 2019 Orange Money makes nearly 1.5 million transactions per day, which corresponds to a monetary value of nearly 15 billion CFA francs per day. The USSD is the technology at the heart of the Mobile-money transactions. Blockchain, which is the underlying technology of the first crypto currency Bitcoin, has drawn a lot of global attention in recent years. Blockchain does not stop seeing its field of action widen. The field of action of the Blockchain has not yet completed its enlargement. The rate of unbanked is still very high in developing countries; this rate is a factor that does not favor the emergence of the economy. It is necessary to count on the mobile money to skip this obstacle (according to the World Bank) we make here the state of the art on the mobile money and its underlying technologies in the sub-Saharan countries and in Burkina-Faso.

A blockchain (BC) is essentially a decentralized ledger that records every transaction made in the network, known as a 'block', the body of which comprises encrypted data of the entire transaction history. The implementation of decentralized technology in any industry would require augmented security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in workflow dynamics from the current hierarchical structure to a decentralized, cooperative chain of command and affect a cultural and societal change by encouraging trust and transparency. This paper presents an evaluation survey of blockchain technology and its applications in the built environment and examines the potential integration with the BIM process. Moreover, the study explores how employing distributed ledger technology (DLT) could be advantageous in the BIM working environment by reinforcing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, and ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The study discusses the basic fundamentals of distributed ledgers, their potential future applications and current advances, and their classification based on inherent characteristics of consensus reaching and permission management. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the potential application of BC technologies in enhancing the framework for automating the construction design review process such as smart contract technologies and Hyperledger Fabric, as well as discussing the pros, cons, and possible future research directions.","[Nawari, Nawari O.; Ravindran, Shriraam] Univ Florida, Coll Design Construct & Planning, Sch Architecture, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Nawari, NO (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Coll Design Construct & Planning, Sch Architecture, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.","nnawari@ufl.edu; shr1raam@ufl.edu","","Ravindran, Shriraam/0000-0002-1385-2662","","","","","47","66","68","22","230","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","2352-7102","","","J BUILD ENG","J.

IRI protects all the intellectual work not only the traditional ones (patents, trademarks, copyright, industrial design, geographical indication) but also those not protected by traditional offices such as ideas, projects, models, services, artefacts. The starting point is how to generate trust between many and different subjects engaged in the innovation value chain in order to create, build and collaborate in the developing of innovation. For this reason BC is also used to certify the actions, activities and relationships between researchers, inventors, students, innovators, funders, industries, user communities during the creation, construction and marketing of innovation. Detaching from the main BC platforms that need the consensus of the transaction based on a mechanism of proofing (especially regarding the financial area like bitcoin or Ethereum) the core of the project is the Proof-of-Originality algorithm (PoOr) that detects and compares the originality of the proposal. The challenge is to verify how the publication on IRI of an idea, project,., assumes a de-facto protection. If an innovator can protect the idea and if the actions and the relationships that allowed the realization of the innovation are certified, he can share it and this allows the co-construction, the development and at the same time this generates trust for the selling or the search for funding.","[Rinaldi, Giovanni] LINK Associati, Via Tiarini 22, I-40129 Bologna, Italy; [Manca, Marco] SCImPULSE Fdn, Board Directors, Johan Ruytersdreef 30, NL-6132 TJ Sittard, Netherlands","","Rinaldi, G (corresponding author), LINK Associati, Via Tiarini 22, I-40129 Bologna, Italy.;Manca, M (corresponding author), SCImPULSE Fdn, Board Directors, Johan Ruytersdreef 30, NL-6132 TJ Sittard, Netherlands.","giovanni.rinaldi@ematchidea.com; marco.manca@cern.ch","Manca, Marco/AAA-4249-2021","Manca, Marco/0000-0002-7869-2620","","","","","5","0","0","4","5","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-34770-3; 978-3-030-34769-7","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2019","11938","","","","","","275","282","","10.1007/978-3-030-34770-3_21","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-34770-3_21","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BQ6HB","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000611730300021","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, applying traditional regulatory strategies to new technological ecosystems has proved conceptually difficult. Part of the challenge lies in managing the trade-offs that accompany the regulation of innovations that could, conceivably, both help and hurt consumers as well as market participants. Problems also arise from the common assumption that today's fintech is a mere continuation of the story of innovation that has shaped finance for centuries. This Article offers a new theoretical framework for understanding and regulating fintech by showing how the supervision of financial innovation is invariably bound by what can be described as a policy trilemma. Specifically, we argue that when seeking to provide clear rules, maintain market integrity, and encourage financial innovation, regulators have long been able to achieve, at best, only two out of these three goals. Moreover, today's innovations exacerbate the trade-offs historically embodied in the trilemma by breaking down financial services supply chains into discrete parts and disintermediating traditional functions using cutting edge, but untested, technologies, thereby introducing unprecedented uncertainty as to their risks and benefits. This Article seeks to catalogue the strategies taken by regulatory authorities to navigate the trilemma, and posits them as operating across a spectrum of interrelated responses. The Article then proposes supplemental administrative tools to support not only market, but also regulatory experimentation and innovation.","[Brummer, Chris] Georgetown Univ, Law Ctr, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Brummer, Chris] Vanderbilt Law Sch, Inst Int Econ Law, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Brummer, Chris; Yadav, Yesha] Vanderbilt Law Sch, Law, Nashville, TN 37203 USA","Georgetown University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University","Brummer, C (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Law Ctr, Washington, DC 20057 USA.;Brummer, C (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Law Sch, Inst Int Econ Law, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.;Brummer, C (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Law Sch, Law, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.","","","","","","","","332","57","58","2","75","GEORGETOWN LAW JOURNAL ASSOC","WASHINGTON","600 NEW JERSEY AVE N W, WASHINGTON, DC 20001 USA","0016-8092","","","GEORGETOWN LAW J","Georget.

To resolve this challenge, several solutions have been proposed so far. Among them, the Dining Cryptographers network protocol (DC-net) provides the strongest anonymity guarantees. However, DC-net suffers from two critical issues that makes it impractical, i.e., (1) collision possibility and (2) vulnerability against disruptions. Apart from that, we noticed a third critical issue during our investigation. (3) DC-net users can be deanonymized after they publish at least three messages. We name this problem the short stability issue and prove that anonymity is provided only for a few cycles of message publishing. As far as we know, this problem has not been identified in the previous research works. In this paper, we propose Harmonized and Stable DC-net (HSDC net), a self-organizing protocol for anonymous communications. In our protocol design, we first resolve the short stability issue and obtain SDC-net, a stable extension of DC-net. Then, we integrate the Slot Reservation and Disruption Management sub-protocols into SDC-net to overcome the collision and security issues, respectively. The obtained HSDC-net protocol can also be integrated into blockchain-based cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin) to mix multiple transactions (belonging to different users) into a single transaction in such a way that the source of each payment is unknown. This preserves privacy of blockchain users. Our prototype implementation shows that HSDC-net achieves low latencies that makes it a practical protocol.","[Nosouhi, Mohammad Reza; Yu, Shui] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Software, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Nosouhi, Mohammad Reza; Grobler, Marthie] CSIROs Data61, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Sood, Keshav] Deakin Univ, Sch Informat Technol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","University of Technology Sydney; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Deakin University","Nosouhi, MR (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Software, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Nosouhi, MR (corresponding author), CSIROs Data61, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.","mohammad.r.nosouhi@student.uts.edu.au; shui.yu@uts.edu.au; keshav.sood@deakin.edu.au; Marthie.Grobler@data61.csiro.au","Grobler, Marthie/D-1433-2019","Grobler, Marthie/0000-0001-6933-0145; Nosouhi, Mohammad Reza/0000-0001-6959-0975; Yu, Shui/0000-0003-4485-6743","","","","","22","2","2","0","2","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","2324-9013","","978-1-7281-2776-7","IEEE TRUST BIG","","","2019","","","","","","","350","357","","10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00054","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00054","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP8TQ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000567324100043","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We introduce LEAP, a trainable, general framework for predicting the presence and properties of edges on the basis of the local structure, topology, and labels of the graph. The LEAP framework is based on the exploration and machine-learning aggregation of the paths connecting nodes in a graph. We provide several methods for performing the aggregation phase by training path aggregators, and we demonstrate the flexibility and generality of the framework by applying it to the prediction of links and user ratings in social networks. We validate the LEAP framework on two problems: link prediction, and user rating prediction. On eight large datasets, among which the arXiv collaboration network, the Yeast protein-protein interaction, and the US airlines routes network, we show that the link prediction performance of LEAP is at least as good as the current state of the art methods, such as SEAL and WLNM. Next, we consider the problem of predicting user ratings on other users: this problem is known as the edge-weight prediction problem in weighted signed networks (WSN). On Bitcoin networks, and Wikipedia RfA, we show that LEAP performs consistently better than the Fairness & Goodness based regression models, varying the amount of training edges between 10 to 90%. These examples demonstrate that LEAP, in spite of its generality, can match or best the performance of approaches that have been especially crafted to solve very specific edge prediction problems.","[Agrawal, Rakshit; de Alfaro, Luca] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz","Agrawal, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.","ragrawa1@ucsc.edu; luca@ucsc.edu","Agrawal, Rakshit/AGY-2993-2022","","","","","","42","3","3","0","3","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","","978-1-4503-6674-8","","","","2019","","","","","","","15","25","","10.1145/3308558.3313695","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313695","","","11","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BN5LD","","Bronze, Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000483508400005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

As stated in the original paper by Nakamoto, at the heart of these systems lies the problem of preventing double-spending; this is usually solved by achieving consensus on the order of transfers among the participants. By treating the asset transfer problem as a concurrent object and determining its consensus number, we show that consensus is not necessary to prevent double-spending. We first consider the problem as defined by Nakamoto, where only a single process-the account owner-can withdraw from each account. Safety and liveness need to be ensured for correct account owners, whereas misbehaving account owners might be unable to perform transfers. We show that the consensus number of an asset transfer object is 1. We then consider a more general k-shared asset transfer object where up to k processes can atomically withdraw from the same account, and show that this object has consensus number k. We first establish these these results in the context of shared memory with benign faults, in order to properly understand the level of difficulty of the asset transfer problem. Then, we translate our result in the more practically relevant message passing setting with Byzantine players. We describe an asynchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant asset transfer implementation that is both simpler and more efficient than state-of-the-art consensus-based solutions. Our results are applicable to both the permissioned (private) and permissionless (public) setting, as normally their differentiation is hidden by the abstractions on top of which our algorithms are based.","[Guerraoui, Rachid; Monti, Matteo; Pavlovic, Matej; Seredinschi, Dragos-Adrian] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Kuznetsov, Petr] Telecom Paris, IP Paris, LTCI, Paris, France","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; Institut Polytechnique de Paris","Guerraoui, R (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.","rachid.guerraoui@epfl.ch; petr.kuznetsov@telecom-paristech.fr; matteo.monti@epfl.ch; matej.pavlovic@epfl.ch; dragos-adrian.seredinschi@epfl.ch","","Guerraoui, Rachid/0000-0002-4794-8902; Monti, Matteo/0000-0002-3993-8560","European ERC [339539 -AOC]","European ERC(European Research Council (ERC))","This work has been supported in part by the European ERC Grant 339539 -AOC.","","48","10","10","0","0","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-6217-7","","","","2019","","","","","","","307","316","","10.1145/3293611.3331589","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3293611.3331589","","","10","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP9QA","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000570442000045","View Full Record in Web of Science"

To regulate the interaction between these tokens and users as well as third-party tools (e.g., wallets, exchange markets, etc.), several standards have been proposed for the implementation of token contracts. Although existing tokens involve lots of money, little is known whether or not their behaviors are consistent with the standards. Inconsistent behaviors can lead to user confusion and financial loss, because users/third-party tools interact with token contracts by invoking standard interfaces and listening to standard events. In this work, we take the first step to investigate such inconsistent token behaviors with regard to ERC-20, the most popular token standard. We propose a novel approach to automatically detect such inconsistency by contrasting the behaviors derived from three different sources, including the manipulations of core data structures recording the token holders and their shares, the actions indicated by standard interfaces, and the behaviors suggested by standard events. We implement our approach in a new tool named TokenScope and use it to inspect all transactions sent to the deployed tokens. We detected 3,259,001 transactions that trigger inconsistent behaviors, and these behaviors resulted from 7,472 tokens. By manually examining all (2,353) open-source tokens having inconsistent behaviors, we found that the precision of TokenScope is above 99.9%. Moreover, we revealed 11 major reasons behind the inconsistency, e.g., flawed tokens, standard methods missing, lack of standard events, etc. In particular, we discovered 50 unreported flawed tokens.","[Chen, Ting; Zhang, Yufei; Li, Zihao; Cao, Rong; Xiao, Xiuzhuo; Zhang, Xiaosong] UESTC, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Luo, Xiapu] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ting] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park","Chen, T (corresponding author), UESTC, Chengdu, Peoples R China.","brokendragon@uestc.edu.cn; 2235285714@qq.com; gforiq@qq.com; daniel.xiapu.luo@polyu.edu.hk; inbox.ting@gmail.com","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61872057]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFB0804100]; National Science Foundation [1718787, 1846151]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","Ting Chen is partially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (61872057) and National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFB0804100).

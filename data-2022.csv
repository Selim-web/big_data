We show that both the production of and the speculation with Bitcoin draw from the existing global pool of value-added. By extending the Classical Political Economy approach and the New Interpretation of the labour theory of value to the domain of digital commodities, the paper argues that Bitcoin mining is an automated reproduction process that requires no direct (living) labour and thus creates no new value. Bitcoin, in this regard, is not 'digital gold'. Between sectors, Bitcoin mining redistributes wealth and value-added already in existence, while Bitcoin miners with more computational power compete to appropriate the mining profits within the blockchain. The Bitcoin blockchain then creates rivalry in both the ownership and the use of the digital commodity through non-legal means. Our approach can be further expanded to the larger domain of automated digital commodities that are reproducible without the expenditure of direct, living labour.","[Rotta, Tomas N.] Univ London, Goldsmiths Coll, Inst Management Studies, London, England; [Parana, Edemilson] Univ Fed Ceara, Dept Social Sci, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil","","Rotta, TN (corresponding author), Univ London, Goldsmiths Coll, Inst Management Studies, London, England.","t.rotta@gold.ac.uk","","Rotta, Tomas/0000-0002-5304-9890; Parana, Edemilson/0000-0003-3487-9677","","","","","55","0","0","16","16","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1356-3467","1469-9923","","NEW POLIT ECON","New Polit.

This paper aims to implement a scenario analysis method to generate various hypothetical events and then determine their effects on the value of Bitcoin price. Scenario analysis is normally used to measure financial risk. In this paper, we propose a method that combines scenario analysis with historical data. We further aim to find the correlations among scenarios and examine the relationship between the significant shocks and Bitcoin prices.

This relation is shown to be robust when controlling for a variety of exchange-specific and blockchain-wide variables. This relation is also robust when controlling for aggregate momentum across major cryptocurrencies. This finding is important as our data sample spans a period before and after the introduction of futures markets for bitcoin, which has arguably resulted in a regime shift in the time series behavior of its price.

Regarding macroeconomic variables, financial conditions index, TED spread, US M2 money stock, and funding cost of financial institutions could predict bitcoin futures returns.

The rise and fall of bitcoin's value is difficult to predict, and the system is fraught with uncertainty. As a result, this study proposed to use the Deep learning technique for predicting fi-nancial risk associated with bitcoin investment, that is linked to its weighted price on the bitcoin market's volatility. The dataset used included Bitcoin historical data, which was acquired at one-minute intervals from selected exchanges of January 2012 through December 2020. The deep learning lin-ear-SVM-based technique was used to obtain an advantage in handling the high-dimensional challenges related with bitcoin-based transaction transac-tions large data volume. Four variables (High, Low, Close, and Volume (BTC).) are conceptualized to predict weighted price, in order to indicate if there is a propensity of financial risk over the effect of their interaction. The results of the experimental investigation show that the financial risk associated with bitcoin investing is accurately predicted. This has helped to discover engagements and disengagements with doubts linked with bitcoin investment transactions, resulting in increased confidence and trust in the system as well as the elimination of financial risk. Our model had a significantly greater prediction accuracy, demonstrating the utility of deep learning systems in detecting financial problems related to digital currency.","[Aljojo, Nahla] Univ Jeddah, Informat Syst & Technol Dept, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","","Aljojo, N (corresponding author), Univ Jeddah, Informat Syst & Technol Dept, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.","nmaljojo@uj.edu.sa","","","","","","","32","0","0","2","2","EDICIONES UNIV SALAMANCA","SALAMANCA","APARTADO DE CORREOS 325, SALAMANCA, 00000, SPAIN","2255-2863","","","ADCAIJ-ADV DISTRIB C","ADCAIJ-Adv.

Therefore, in this work, we present a novel approach to address the class imbalance in Bitcoin entity classification by applying GANs. In particular, three GAN architectures were implemented and compared in order to find the most suitable architecture for generating Bitcoin entity behaviours. More specifically, GANs were used to address the Bitcoin imbalance problem by generating synthetic data of the less represented classes before training the final entity classifier. The results were used to evaluate the capabilities of the different GAN architectures in terms of training time, performance, repeatability, and computational costs. Finally, the results achieved by the proposed GAN-based resampling were compared with those obtained using five well-known data-level preprocessing techniques. Models trained with data resampled with our GAN-based approach achieved the highest accuracy improvements and were among the best in terms of precision, recall and f1-score. Together with Random Oversampling (ROS), GANs proved to be strong contenders in addressing Bitcoin class imbalance and consequently in reducing Bitcoin entity anonymity (overall and per-class classification performance). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore the advantages and limitations of GANs in generating specific Bitcoin data and attacking Bitcoin anonymity. The proposed methods ultimately demonstrate that in Bitcoin applications, GANs are indeed able to learn the data distribution and generate new samples starting from a very limited class representation, which leads to better detection of classes related to illegal activities.","[Zola, Francesco; Segurola-Gil, Lander; Bruse, Jan L.; Orduna-Urrutia, Raul] Vicomtech Fdn, Digital Secur, Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Paseo Mikeletegi 20009, Donostia San Se, Spain; [Zola, Francesco; Galar, Mikel] Univ Publ Navarra, Inst Smart Cities, Pamplona 31006, Spain","","Zola, F (corresponding author), Vicomtech Fdn, Digital Secur, Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Paseo Mikeletegi 20009, Donostia San Se, Spain.;Zola, F (corresponding author), Univ Publ Navarra, Inst Smart Cities, Pamplona 31006, Spain.","fzola@vicomtech.org; lsegurola@vicomtech.org; jbruse@vicomtech.org; mikel.galar@unavarra.es; rorduna@vicomtech.org","Bruse, Jan Lukas/AAU-3824-2020","Bruse, Jan Lukas/0000-0002-5774-1593; Zola, Francesco/0000-0002-1733-5515","Spanish Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI) under the project EGIDA [CER20191012]","Spanish Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI) under the project EGIDA","This work has been partially supported by the Spanish Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI) under the project EGIDA (CER20191012) - RED DE EXCELENCIA EN TECNOLOGIAS DE SEGURIDAD Y PRIVACIDAD.","","86","0","0","4","4","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0924-669X","1573-7497","","APPL INTELL","Appl.

Two of Bitcoin's challenges are (i) securing sufficient miner revenues as block rewards decrease, and (ii) alleviating the throughput limitation due to a small maximal block size cap. These issues are strongly related as increasing the maximal block size may decrease revenue due to Bitcoin's pay-your-bid approach. To decouple them, we analyze the monopolistic auction [16], showing (i) its revenue does not decrease as the maximal block size increases, (ii) it is resilient to an untrusted auctioneer (the miner), and (iii) simplicity for transaction issuers (bidders), as the average gain from strategic bid shading (relative to bidding one's value) diminishes as the number of bids increases.","[Lavi, Ron] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Lavi, Ron] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Ind Engn & Management, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Sattath, O.

Miners are responsible for validating transactions and are incentivized to participate by the promise of a monetary reward. Mining pools have emerged as collectives of miners that ensure a more stable and predictable income. MiningVis aims to help analysts understand the evolution and dynamics of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem, including mining market statistics, multi-measure mining pool rankings, and pool hopping behavior.

Our results are driven by negative network effects which arise due to Bitcoin's need for consensus and the existence of network de-lay. As the Bitcoin network expands, network delay grows thereby prolonging the time needed for generating consensus. In turn, transaction settlement becomes prolonged, and users abandon the system, yielding limited adoption. Increasing transaction rates fails to solve this problem because increasing transaction rates increases fork probabilities which prolongs the consensus process and generates limited adoption.

The study aims to measure awareness of Bitcoin, which has recently become popular among investors with its rapidly increasing use. To this end, a questionnaire was applied to the participants to evaluate their opinions and preferences regarding Bitcoin. With this purpose in mind, a questionnaire was applied to the academics of Erzincan Binali Yildirim University in Turkey. Methodology: In the process of analysing the obtained data, frequency analysis and the chi-square test method were used by using the SPSS 26.0 software package. Results: According to the results of the study, it was observed that 51.6% of the academics (159 persons) had knowledge of Bitcoin, and while 31.5% of the academics participating in the study (97 persons) considered they would buy Bitcoin within five years, 57% (176 persons) conceived the use of Bitcoin would increase within ten years. Despite all these positive attitudes, it was also observed that 45.5% (140 people) considered Bitcoin as unreliable and 51.6% (159 persons) would prefer gold instead of using Bitcoin. As for the opinion of academics, it was conduded that gold and other different investment tools would be preferred instead of Bitcoin despite its increasing use. Conclusion: This research is important as it is the first research study in the field, which means that no similar study has been conducted in Turkey before, and it is thus expected to greatly contribute to the literature within the context of the importance and originality of the study.","[Karabulut, Turgut; Sari, Salim Sercan] Erzincan Binali Yildirim Univ, Dept Business Adm, TR-24100 Merkez Erzincan, Turkey","","Karabulut, T (corresponding author), Erzincan Binali Yildirim Univ, Dept Business Adm, TR-24100 Merkez Erzincan, Turkey.","tkarabulut@erzincan.edu.tr; salim.sari@erzincan.edu.tr","","","","","","","16","0","0","0","0","SVEUCILISTE JOSIPA JURJA STROSSMAYERA & OSIJEKU, EKONOMSKI FAK","OSIJEK","GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA","0353-359X","1847-2206","","EKON VJESN","Ekon.

Our results reveal that volatility modeling provides better results with the Dynamic Conditional Correlation model. The performance of the portfolio is largely due to the high returns of Bitcoin which allows for better portfolio diversification. As a result, there is a mitigation of the extreme rates of return associated with crypto-currencies. Finally, while Bitcoin's contribution to the portfolio is more attributable to its risk than its return, it does play a role in stabilizing portfolio performance, for varying levels of risk.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.","[Haffar, Adlane] Univ Sci & Technol Houari Boumediene, Fac Math, MSTD Lab, POB 32 Bab Ezzouar, Algiers 16111, Algeria; [Le Fur, Eric] INSEEC Grande Ecole, H19 Quai Bacalan, F-33000 Bordeaux, France","","Le Fur, E (corresponding author), INSEEC Grande Ecole, H19 Quai Bacalan, F-33000 Bordeaux, France.","adlene.haffar@usthb.edu.dz; elefur@inseec.com","","LE FUR, ERIC/0000-0002-3932-2125","","","","","83","0","0","7","7","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1062-9769","1878-4259","","Q REV ECON FINANC","Q.

Its protocol is today among the most influential for cryptocurrencies and distributed networks. In particular, the P2P layer represents a reference point for all permissionless blockchains, which often implement its solutions in their network layer. Unfortunately, the Bitcoin network protocol lacks a strong security model, leaving it exposed to several threats. Attacks at this level can affect the reliability and trustworthiness of the consensus layer, mining the credibility of the whole system. It is therefore of utmost importance to properly understand and address the security of the Bitcoin P2P protocol. In this paper, we give a comprehensive and detailed overview of known network-level attacks in Bitcoin, as well as the countermeasures that have been implemented in the protocol. We propose a generic network adversary model, and propose an objective-based taxonomy of the attacks. Finally, we identify the core weaknesses of the protocol and study the relationship between different types of attack.

Design/methodology/approach A unique dataset from a person-to-person (p2p) exchange is used to investigate association between Bitcoin trading volume and currency prices. Currency returns are used to identify local economic crises, the 8 crisis affected currencies are Venezuela Bolivar (VES), Iranian Rial (IRR), Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH), Argentine Peso (ARS), Egyptian Pound (EGP), Nigerian Naira (NGN), Turkish Lira (TRY) and Kazakhstani Tenge (KZT). Findings The paper demonstrates that local economic crises are positively associated with increased Bitcoin trading. There is a negative association between trading volume and currency value (and return), suggesting low currency price and currency depreciation are accompanied with increased Bitcoin trading. The results not only hold for the crisis affected currencies but also currencies of advanced economies. Granger causality test also reinforces the negative association results. Originality/value The finding indicates some forms of flight-to-safety have occurred during local market crises when capital flight from domestic markets to Bitcoin, strengthening Bitcoin's hedging asset status. However, total global trading volume declines after the start of the COVID pandemic, suggesting that Bitcoin is still regarded as a speculative asset. Overall, the findings show that Bitcoin is a hedging asset to protect against local currency depreciation, but not a safe-haven asset for the global crisis.","[Zhao, Jinsha] Kingston Univ, Fac Business & Social Sci, Dept Accounting Finance & Informat, Kingston Upon Thames, Surrey, England","","Zhao, JS (corresponding author), Kingston Univ, Fac Business & Social Sci, Dept Accounting Finance & Informat, Kingston Upon Thames, Surrey, England.","j.zhao@kingston.ac.uk","","Zhao, Jinsha/0000-0002-3223-7323","","","","","35","0","0","7","7","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1940-5979","1940-5987","","REV BEHAV FINANCE","Rev.

Several existing studies quantify the impact of ransomware activities, mostly focusing on the amount of ransom. However, victims' reactions in Bitcoin that can well reflect the impact of ransomware activities are somehow largely neglected. Besides, existing studies track ransom transfers at the Bitcoin address level, making it difficult for them to uncover the patterns of ransom transfers from a macro perspective beyond Bitcoin addresses. In this article, we conduct a large-scale analysis of ransom payments, ransom transfers, and victim migrations in Bitcoin from 2012 to 2021. First, we develop a fine-grained address clustering method to cluster Bitcoin addresses into users, which enables us to identify more addresses controlled by ransomware criminals. Second, motivated by the fact that Bitcoin activities and their participants already formed stable industries, such as Darknet and Miner, we train a multi-label classification model to identify the industry identifiers of users. Third, we identify ransom payment transactions and then quantify the amount of ransom and the number of victims in 63 ransomware activities. Finally, after we analyze the trajectories of ransom transferred across different industries and track victims' migrations across industries, we find out that to obscure the purposes of their transfer trajectories, most ransomware criminals (e.g., operators of Locky and Wannacry) prefer to spread ransom into multiple industries instead of utilizing the services of Bitcoin mixers. Compared with other industries, Investment is highly resilient to ransomware activities in the sense that the number of users in Investment remains relatively stable. Moreover, we also observe that a few victims become active in the Darknet after paying ransom. Our findings in this work can help authorities deeply understand ransomware activities in Bitcoin. While our study focuses on ransomware, our methods are potentially applicable to other cybercriminal activities that have similarly adopted bitcoins as their payments.","[Wang, Kai; Huang, Dapeng] Fudan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, 2005 Songhu Rd, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [Pang, Jun] Univ Luxembourg, Dept Comp Sci, 6 Ave Fonte, L-4364 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Chen, Dingjie; Zhao, Yu; Chen, Chen; Han, Weili] Fudan Univ, Software Sch, 2005 Songhu Rd, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China","","Han, WL (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Software Sch, 2005 Songhu Rd, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China.","wangk20@fudan.edu.cn; jun.pang@uni.lu; djchen18@fudan.edu.cn; zhaoy20@fudan.edu.cn; dphuang@fudan.edu.cn; chenc@fudan.edu.cn; wlhan@fudan.edu.cn","","Pang, Jun/0000-0002-4521-4112","Natural Science Foundation of China [U1836207]; National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFE0103800]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2020M670998]","Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation)","This article has been supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (U1836207), the National Key R&D Program of China (2019YFE0103800), and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2020M670998).","","48","0","0","2","2","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA","1559-1131","1559-114X","","ACM T WEB","ACM Trans.

Then, we compare the VaR estimates based on the parametric methods, namely the GARCH model with the normal distribution (GARCH-Normal) and the GARCH model with the normal inverse Gaussian distribution (GARCHNIG), and the nonparametric method. Our results illustrate that although the VaR estimates based on the nonparametric method are overall accurate and even more accurate than the VaR estimates based on the GARCH-Normal model, the VaR estimates based on the GARCH-NIG model perform the best. Overall, we conclude that the GARCH-NIG model could generate accurate VaR estimates for the Bitcoin futures return series. In addition, we found that in contrast to Bitcoin cash, the return volatilities of the Bitcoin futures do not increase by more in response to positive shocks than in response to negative shocks.","[Guo, Zi-Yi] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN 37203 USA","","Guo, ZY (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.","zachguo0824@gmail.com","","","","","","","30","3","3","9","10","ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE","SAN DIEGO","525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","1544-6123","1544-6131","","FINANC RES LETT","Financ.

This effect corresponds to the description of the 'collective hysteria' that spread in the online community and was triggered by the increasing volatility of the Bitcoin market. Secondly, we found that Bitcoin's popularity among ordinary Internet users has a positive impact in low-volatile and highly volatile rising markets but a negative one in a highly volatile falling market. Thirdly, Bitcoin's popularity among informed Internet users has a negative impact on Bitcoin price in a period of low volatility. Fourthly, uninformed users' trust in Bitcoin has a positive influence on Bitcoin price in low-volatile and highly volatile falling markets.

A triple regime-switching vector approach","JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION","","","English","Article","","","","","","Bitcoin volatility; Bitcoin bubble; Emotions; Sentiment; Regime-switching VAR model; Nonlinearity","SENTIMENT","In this paper, we build an empirical specification that helps to explain bitcoin volatility and to characterize phases of the bitcoin bubble using information derived from investors' emotions and sentiment that captures investment intentions and investors' aversion to risk. To this end, we investigated the bilateral relations between bitcoin volatility and investor emotions between 2018 and 2021, a period characterized by significant changes in bitcoin prices as well as wide disparities in investor emotions, especially in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The study was based on a linear and nonlinear Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model that we applied to data related to bitcoin prices and market sentiment as expressed by the Fear and Greed index. Overall, our results evince the key role played by collective emotions in the formation and collapse of the bitcoin bubble. Two findings in particular stand out. First, our model shows significant time-varying lead-lag effects between bitcoin volatility and investor sentiment that come into play bilaterally and help to characterize the dynamics of bitcoin volatility. Second, these interactions exhibit asymmetry and nonlinearity as the sign and size of collective emotions (resp. bitcoin volatility) vary with the regime and market state under consideration (calm state versus period of bubble formation, etc.). In other words, the power of sentiment has a time-varying effect on the market. Indeed, in the first regime (calm state), where bitcoin volatility is relatively low and the market shows evidence of stability, collective emotions have a negative impact on bitcoin volatility, prompting a stabilizing strength. However, in the second regime (bubble formation), the effect of emotions turns significantly positive as investors gradually become less fearful and more reassured, which can simultaneously increase volatility and destabilize the market. Finally, in the third regime (bubble collapse), when bitcoin reaches a high level of value and experiences impressive volatility excess, the effect of emotions again turns negative, resulting in further switching behavior that pushes investor action to provoke a bitcoin price correction, moving it toward a new state of stability. Our conclusion helps improve predictions of bitcoin price dynamics informed by the information provided by investor emotions. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Bitcoin provides users' anonymity through cryptographic pseudonyms. Bitcoin operates on a peer-to-peer network that maintains a public ledger, called blockchain, to log all transactions from one pseudonym to other, thereby hides the identity of the users. A transaction graph from the blockchain may unveil certain users' identities. To sustain with users' anonymity, mixing is often applied. CoinJoin, MixCoin, CoinShuffle, CoinParty and SecureCoin are some of the Bitcoin protocols that apply mixnet. Mixnet has certain limitations. Firstly, protocols assume escrow addressee that collects the coins, and performs mixing. The escrow addressee must be trustworthy. Secondly, protocols which do not assume escrow addressee, often use mixnet. Mixnet requires every participant must sign all others transactions. This incurs large volume of multi-signature. Presently, Bitcoin protocol can include at most 15 multi-signatures. Therefore, the protocols are not scalable. Finally, mixnet is all-or-nothing. That is, if all mixnodes are active then only the output is guaranteed. We present a multiparty shuffling protocol to anonymize the Bitcoin transactions.

Bitcoin has arisen as the best digital currency, since its appearance back in 2009 and its ascent, it has gotten little consideration from the insights. Other than its security power, two principle properties have most likely been its critical to progress: secrecy and decentralization. This paper depicts that, we give an exhaustive portrayal on the subtleties that make such cryptographic money a fascinating examination subject with regards to the protection local area. We play out a comprehensive examination of the bitcoin namelessness research papers that have been distributed up until this point and we frame a few issues and difficulties. Bitcoin is an internet-based communication protocol that works with the utilization of a virtual money, including electronic pay-outs. Bitcoin's guidelines were planned by engineers with no evident impact from legal counsellors or regulators. Bitcoin is based on an exchange log that is circulated across an organization of partaking PCs. It incorporates mechanisms to remunerate genuine investment, to bootstrap acknowledgment by early adopters, and to prepare for groupings of force. Bitcoin's plan considers irreversible exchanges, a recommended way of cash creation over the long run, and a public money exchange history. Anybody can sign up for Bitcoin account, without charge and with next to no concentrated verifying method or even a necessity to give a genuine name. By and large, these standards yield a framework that is perceived to be more adaptable, more private, and less agreeable to administrative oversight than different types of pay-outs however, this multitude of advantages face significant cut-off points. Bitcoin is important to business analysts as a virtual cash with potential to disturb existing monetary transactional frameworks and maybe even financial frameworks. This paper presents the stage's plan standards and properties for a nontechnical crowd; surveys its past, present, and future purposes; and calls attention to gambles and regulatory aspects as Bitcoin connects with the traditional monetary framework and the genuine economy.","[Choudhary, Lehar; Raj, Kiran] Manipal Univ Jaipur, Sch Law, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India","","Raj, K (corresponding author), Manipal Univ Jaipur, Sch Law, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.","kiran.raj@jaipur.manipal.edu","","","","","","","21","0","0","0","0","ANADOLU UNIV","ESKISEHIR","INST FINE ARTS, ESKISEHIR, 26470, TURKEY","1308-5581","","","INT J EARLY CHILD SP","Int.

The shift in computational paradigm towards quantum computation allows the entire search space of the golden nonce to be queried at once by exploiting quantum superpositions and entanglement. Using Grover's algorithm, a solution can be extracted in time O(root 2(256)/t), where t is the target value for the nonce. This is better using a square root over the classical search algorithm that requires O(2(256)/t) tries. If sufficiently large quantum computers are available for the public, mining activity in the classical sense becomes obsolete, as quantum computers always win. Without considering quantum noise, the size of the quantum computer needs to be approximate to 10(4) qubits.","[Benkoczi, Robert; Gaur, Daya; Hossain, Shahadat] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada; [Nagy, Naya] Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal Univ, Coll Comp Sci & IT, Dammam 34212, Saudi Arabia; [Nagy, Marius] Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd Univ, Coll Comp Engn & Sci, Al Khobar 31952, Saudi Arabia","","Nagy, N (corresponding author), Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal Univ, Coll Comp Sci & IT, Dammam 34212, Saudi Arabia.","robert.benkoczi@uleth.ca; gaur@cs.uleth.ca; nmnagy@iau.edu.sa; mnagy@pmu.edu.sa; shahadat.hossain@uleth.ca","Nagy, Naya/GRR-5285-2022; Nagy, Naya/B-2332-2015","Nagy, Naya/0000-0001-5325-0781; Gaur, Daya/0000-0001-6876-6000; Nagy, Marius/0000-0003-2202-1681","Alberta Ministry of Economic Development, Trade, and Tourism","Alberta Ministry of Economic Development, Trade, and Tourism","The APC was funded by Alberta Ministry of Economic Development, Trade, and Tourism.","","26","0","0","3","3","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1099-4300","","ENTROPY-SWITZ","Entropy","MAR","2022","24","3","","","","","","","323","10.3390/e24030323","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e24030323","","","15","Physics, Multidisciplinary","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Physics","0C8CJ","35327834","gold, Green Published","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000775534400001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The paper also investigates whether and to what extent it is desirable for institutional investors, in addition to traditional financial instruments, to invest in Bitcoin. The aim of the research is to examine whether it is justified and to what extent to include Bitcoin in the portfolio of an institutional investor. Through this research, an attempt is made to find an answer to the research question: What share of Bitcoin in the portfolio structure is justified, taking into account the ratio of return and risk? The analysis includes data on the daily movement of selected action indices as well as the movement of Bitcoin. The methodology involves the analysis of high-frequency data, given that daily trading data were used. The results show that it is justified to include Bitcoin in the portfolio structure. Also, the results show which share of Bitcoin in the portfolio is justified from the aspect of institutional investors. The data used in the analysis cover the period from 2019 and 2020. Two portfolios have been created, one without Bitcoin and the other with Bitcoin. The goal in optimization for both portfolios is to minimize risk. The observed period of the analysis is characterized by the crisis caused by the coronary virus pandemic and the period of active bitcoin trading. The results of the research show that Bitcoin is a good source of diversification in a portfolio that contains traditional financial instruments, both for an investor who is not prone to risk, and for those investors who have a greater appetite for risk. The conclusion is that the rational behavior of institutional investors requires consideration of investing in Bitcoin using the Markowitz model. However, given the high degree of volatility, investors should be careful when making decisions about including Bitcoin in their investment portfolio. Bitcoin is an extremely volatile instrument. Given that it is a speculative and highly volatile financial instrument, investors have different views on Bitcoin. First in terms of defining this cryptocurrency and then in terms of including this instrument in the investment portfolio. By including Bitcoin in the investment portfolio, the goal of diversification has been achieved. This is to reduce the risk of the institutional investor to a minimum. In practice, this means that it is possible to create a portfolio that carries an acceptable level of risk with the desired level of return. Given that Bitcoin is an extremely volatile and consequently - risky instrument, the expected return is also - high. The results of the research show that the cryptocurrency Bitcoin can serve as a desirable instrument for diversification of the investment portfolio when looking at a portfolio that includes stock indices. The results suggest that it is desirable to include in the structure of the portfolio a certain share of Bitcoin, about 6%.","[Grujic, Milos] Pens Reserve Fund Management Co Republika Srpska, Banja Luka, Bosnia & Herceg; [Soja, Tijana] Cent Bank Bosnia & Herzegovina, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg","","Grujic, M (corresponding author), Pens Reserve Fund Management Co Republika Srpska, Banja Luka, Bosnia & Herceg.","milos.grujic@prefis.rs.ba; tijana_soja@yahoo.com","Grujić, Miloš/AFE-4544-2022","Grujić, Miloš/0000-0001-5566-5921","","","","","36","0","0","1","1","PAN-EUROPEAN UNIV APEIRON","BANJA LUKA","PAN-EUROPEAN UNIV APEIRON, BANJA LUKA, 00000, BOSNIA & HERCEG","2232-8823","2232-9633","","CAS EKON TRZ KOMUN","Cas.

Despite these increasing concerns, however, only a few studies have addressed them. This article examines the problem using agent-based modeling. In our model, agents are designed to interact with one another in two ways: Price and social interactions. In their price interactions, agents adopt one of three strategies (fundamentalist, momentum trading, and contrarian trading) in investing at each time and adopt a strategy to maximize their expected benefits. In their social interactions, uninvolved agents become involved at various times based on their network properties (word-of-mouth effect). To examine the distinctive properties of Bitcoin from a comparative perspective, two representative currencies (Euro and Turkish lira) and two financial assets (Nasdaq and Nasdaq leverage index) are used in the agent-based model. The results show that the fraction of fundamentalists and price volatility have mutual Granger causal relationships overall. Also, no significant differences are found in the parameters of social interaction. These results are contrary to commonly held beliefs that Bitcoin prices are merely a result of blind pursuit and herding behavior.","[Ha, Taehyun] Korea Inst Sci & Technol Informat, Seoul Off, Future Technol Anal Ctr, Seoul 02456, South Korea; [Lee, Sangwon] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Interact Sci, Seoul 03063, South Korea","","Lee, S (corresponding author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Interact Sci, Seoul 03063, South Korea.","ontophilla@gmail.com; upcircle@skku.edu","","Lee, Sangwon/0000-0002-9825-0854","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2019S1A5A8035093]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [NRF-2020R1A2C4002026]","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea under Grant NRF-2019S1A5A8035093 and in part by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) under Grant NRF-2020R1A2C4002026.","","38","0","0","0","0","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","0018-9391","1558-0040","","IEEE T ENG MANAGE","IEEE Trans.

Therefore, given the rapid valuation and strong price volatility of Bitcoin in combination with the huge potential for expansion that cryptocurrencies are expected to hold, the ability to develop technologies to help users and financial institutions carrying out transactions based on Bitcoins is also highly sought. To improve understanding of the technological trends associated with the recent valuation explosion of Bitcoin, this study assesses patent filing patterns associated with Bitcoin-based technologies. More specifically, this study provides robust empirical evidence pointing out that the recent increased visibility of Bitcoin also motivated a strong increase in patent filings addressing technologies related to Bitcoin, thereby turning this particular cryptocurrency into a technological hotspot. Additionally, we present evidence that most Bitcoin technologies address data processing issues, rather than electric signal processing, or hardware technologies. Another relevant finding concerns the geographical concentration of patent applications, as the majority of applicants are based in highly heterogeneous countries, such as United States, China, and South Korea.","[Cavalheiro, Gabriel M. do C.] Univ Fed Fluminense UFF, Dept Entrepreneurship & Management, Rua Mario Santos Braga S-N,Campus Valonguinho, BR-24020140 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Cavalheiro, Mariana B.] Univ Fed Fluminense UFF, Fac Tourism, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil","","Cavalheiro, GMD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Fluminense UFF, Dept Entrepreneurship & Management, Rua Mario Santos Braga S-N,Campus Valonguinho, BR-24020140 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.","gabrielmarcuzzo@id.uff.br","","Cavalheiro, Gabriel/0000-0001-5556-8582","","","","","55","0","0","3","3","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1422-2213","1747-1796","","J WORLD INTELLECT PR","J.

In this environment in 2008 was developed a new type of currency, namely Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency, as this new form of money has been generically called, puts pressure on the traditional concept of money. Today, the economic value of cryptocurrencies is attested by their circulation and acceptance by user communities for trade. However, establishing this value raises debates in the literature. The research from this paper investigates and analyses if there is a strong enough connectedness between Bitcoin price evolution and energy consumption tendency (for mining), to influence Bitcoin value. Public data from January 2014 to July 2021 is used. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used to study and predict the tendency of Bitcoin price and energy consumption. A comparison between the forecasting trend and the real trend (the evolution of energy consumption and Bitcoin price) was made. The conducted research starts with a quantitative one and ends with a qualitative one (trends).

Based on these studies, this paper analyzes the Bitcoin blockchain in the period where Mt.Gox was active. We model the transactions in the blockchain as a graph and evaluate the degree centrality of each node. We thus analyze how the ranking of nodes with the highest centrality values changes over time. Our conclusions indicate that top nodes are stable, but there is a period where it changes. To better understand this behavior, we simulate the insertion of transactions in the network and verify how the ranking changes. As a result, we provide indications that we can use ranking changes to detect malicious activities. We also show a case study using this ranking to predict abnormal behavior in the network.","[Pereira, Daiane M.; Couto, Rodrigo S.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, PEE COPPE GTA, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil","","Pereira, DM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, PEE COPPE GTA, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.","daiane@gta.ufrj.br; rodrigo@gta.ufrj.br","","","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES) [001]; CNPq; FAPERJ [E-26/203.211/2017, E-26/211.144/2019]; FAPESP [15/24494-8]","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPERJ(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)); FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP))","This study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES) -Finance Code 001.

The data of the research covers the period from 2015 to July 2020 and consists of daily price values. Augmented Dickey-Fuller Unit Root Test was used to see whether the stochastic process changes with time. Bitcoin and gold series do not contain a unit root since the oil series is stationary at the level while the difference is stationary. The reason why the series containing unit roots are not stationary is due to structural breaks or not, was investigated by Bai-Perron Unit Root Test with Multiple Structural Breaks. According to the test, it was determined that the Bitcoin series has one break and two regimes, while the gold series has two structural breaks and three different regimes. Whether the research series are cointegrated or not was investigated with the Gregory and Hansen test. The causality between the series was examined with the Toda-Yamamoto causality test, which is based on the VAR (Vector Autoregression) model and examines the causality in the series regardless of the unit root. A two-way causality relationship was determined between the eight lag-long Gold series and the Bitcoin series. In other cases, a causal relationship has not been established. As a result, we give an evidence that Bitcoin and gold prices series followed a parallel pattern while with oil not. Therefore, investors can add Bitcoin into their portfolios to make balance of the risk and return.","[Tufan, Ekrem] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Dept Hlth Management, Canakkale Fac Apllied Sci, Canakkale, Turkey; [Hamarat, Bahattin] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Tourism Fac, Canakkale, Turkey","","Tufan, E (corresponding author), Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Dept Hlth Management, Canakkale Fac Apllied Sci, Canakkale, Turkey.","etufan@yahoo.com; b_hamarat@hotmail.com; aykuyalvact06@gmail.com","TUFAN, EKREM/C-6846-2008","TUFAN, EKREM/0000-0002-1966-0709","","","","","52","0","0","1","1","ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA UNIV IASI FAC ECONOMICS & BUSINESS ADM","IASI","BD CAROL I NO 22, IASI, ROMANIA","2501-1960","2501-3165","","SCI ANN ECON BUS","Sci.

Intuitively, given the extreme volatility and thus risk of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, the idea that Bitcoin is a hedge may be puzzling. Indeed, we show that for extreme levels of volatility, Bitcoin does not reduce the risk if added to a benchmark equity portfolio. This is not only true on average but also holds for sub-samples, including the COVID-19 crisis period.

Further, IA is found to predict bitcoin trading volume but not returns and volatility. Finally, we design an IA-induced trading strategy that yields superior performance to the passive buy-and-hold strategy in 2018.

In bitcoin framework, users as nodes submit coins publicly in which transactions lead to privacy breaches resulting from recurrent attacks by malicious and/or dishonest nodes. Thereby, introducing anonymity into bitcoin transaction becomes an utmost necessity such that adversaries will find it relatively impossible to trace the transaction trajectories of the original bitcoin users. Thus, anonymity is seen to improve the difficulties in revealing the true identities of users, original transactions, transaction addresses and coins. Nonetheless, the perfectly honest condition of mixing services in the bitcoin framework is subjected to compromising attacks. Moreover, Lockmix model and other related mixing service schemes in recent decades are introduced to specifically secure bitcoin and to generally enhance the privacy and accountability framework of blockchain ecosystem. However, providing flexible anonymous and secure mixing services remain a challenge. Therefore, this paper adopts attribute-based signcryption scheme and further proposes Anonymix technique to obfuscates the true identity of clients and their coins prior to transacting with mixing services. The security protocol underlying the Anonymix technique overlays the existing Lockmix model technique to enhance flexibility and achieve complete anonymized bitcoin transaction. The proposed Anonymix technique is composed of properties such as unforgeability, confidentiality, fine-grained access control, authentication, privacy and public verifiability. Anonymix technique is compatible with bitcoin framework and supports trust requirement management for mixing services. Our theoretical analysis proves the Anonymix technique as secured against possible recurrent attacks in the bitcoin framework.","[Adu-Gyamfi, Daniel; Armah, Gabriel Kofi; Adom, Dominic Kwasi] CK Tedam Univ Technol & Appl Sci, Navrongo, Ghana; [Adu-Gyamfi, Daniel; Ansah, Albert Kofi Kwansah; Alornyo, Seth; Zhang, Fengli] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China; [Ansah, Albert Kofi Kwansah] Univ Mines & Technol, Tarkwa, Ghana; [Alornyo, Seth] Koforidua Tech Univ, Koforidua, Ghana","","Adu-Gyamfi, D (corresponding author), CK Tedam Univ Technol & Appl Sci, Navrongo, Ghana.;Adu-Gyamfi, D (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China.","dadugyamfi@cktutas.edu.gh","Adu-Gyamfi, Daniel/V-7459-2019","Adu-Gyamfi, Daniel/0000-0003-3164-0409","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61602097, 61502087, 61472064]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No.61602097, No.61502087, and No.61472064]","","51","1","1","1","1","SPRINGER INDIA","NEW DELHI","7TH FLOOR, VIJAYA BUILDING, 17, BARAKHAMBA ROAD, NEW DELHI, 110 001, INDIA","0975-6809","0976-4348","","INT J SYST ASSUR ENG","Int.

Examinations of this public blockchain resulted in many proposals for improvement in terms of anonymity and privacy. Generally used methods for improvement include mixing protocols, ring signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic commitments, and off-chain storage systems. To the best of our knowledge, in the literature, there is no study examining Bitcoin in terms of differential privacy, which is a privacy notion coming up with some mechanisms that enable running useful statistical queries without identifying any personal information. In this paper, we provide a theoretical examination of differential privacy in Bitcoin. Our motivation arises from the idea that the Bitcoin public blockchain structure can benefit from differential privacy mechanisms for improved privacy, both making anonymization and privacy breaches by direct queries impossible, and preserving the checkability of the integrity of the blockchain. We first examine the current Bitcoin implementation for four query functions using the differential privacy formulation. Then, we present the feasibility of the utilization of two differential privacy mechanisms in Bitcoin; the noise addition to the transaction amounts and the user graph perturbation. We show that these mechanisms decrease the fraction of the cases violating differential privacy, therefore they can be used for improving anonymity and privacy in Bitcoin. Moreover, we showcase the noise addition to transaction amounts by using IBM Differential Privacy Library. We compare four differential privacy mechanisms for varying privacy parameter values and determine the feasible mechanisms and the parameters.","[Kus, Merve Can] Kuveyt Turk Participat Bank, Res & Dev Ctr, TR-41420 Kocaeli, Turkey; [Kus, Merve Can; Levi, Albert] Sabanci Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey","","Kus, MC (corresponding author), Kuveyt Turk Participat Bank, Res & Dev Ctr, TR-41420 Kocaeli, Turkey.;Kus, MC (corresponding author), Sabanci Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey.","mervecank@sabanciuniv.edu","","Kus, Merve Can/0000-0001-5671-4238","","","","","45","0","0","6","6","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","25534","25554","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3151784","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3151784","","","21","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","ZR5KN","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000767821700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This type of digital currency is hugely attracting social media attention; Social media community along with investors and traders interact to share knowledge or to predict the price tendency of the market. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency nowadays, has the highest market capitalization among other currencies. Which means that any major change in its price tendency will definitely affect the whole market and therefore other coins' prices will surely rise or fall accordingly. We can assume that the greatest concern ever of all the traders around the world is to be alerted or aware of such major price tendency shifts in real time, in which may help them gain more profit or cut losses before it is late, or in either way predict the potential market movement of other digital currencies. It is reported that emotional interactions of the social media users especially on Twitter (one of the most globally used micro-blogging social networks especially related to cryptocurrency topics) have a great influence on the trend of the Bitcoin price. The huge number of daily active Twitter users with the enormous volume of tweets related to Bitcoin price tendency makes it remarkable regarding its impact on Bitcoin market interaction. In this paper, we will implement Apache Spark logistic regression model to process the large-scale data after having a sentimental analysis of Twitter tweets regarding Bitcoin, to predict the upcoming price tendency and classify an awareness level to alert potential traders and investors in real time about such potential market changes.","[Moustafa, Housam; Malli, Mohammad; Hazimeh, Hussien] Arab Open Univ, Beirut, Lebanon","","Moustafa, H (corresponding author), Arab Open Univ, Beirut, Lebanon.","hfm0011b@aou.edulb; mmalli@aou.edu.lb; hhazimeh@aou.edu.lb","","","","","","","11","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-9796-1","","","","2022","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/ISDFS55398.2022.9800793","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISDFS55398.2022.9800793","","","6","Computer Science, Cybernetics; Computer Science, Information Systems","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT8AE","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000852444000019","View Full Record in Web of Science"

By estimating a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model, we provide systematic evidence on the relationship among inflation, uncertainty, and Bitcoin and gold prices. Bitcoin appreciates against inflation (or inflation expectation) shocks, confirming its inflation-hedging property claimed by investors. However, unlike gold, Bitcoin prices decline in response to financial uncertainty shocks, rejecting the safe-haven quality. Interestingly, Bitcoin prices do not decrease after policy uncertainty shocks, partly consistent with the notion of Bitcoin's independence from government authorities. We also find an interesting asymmetry in the drivers of Bitcoin price dynamics between the bullish and bearish market. The main findings hold with or without the COVID-19 pandemic episode.","[Choi, Sangyup; Shin, Junhyeok] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea","","Choi, S (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea.","sangyupchoi@yonsei.ac.kr; junhyeok.shin@yonsei.ac.kr","","shin, jun hyeok/0000-0002-4402-9804","Yonsei University [2020-22-0388]","Yonsei University","We would like to thank the editor and an anonymous referee for their valuable comments.

I trace the ideological underpinnings of the protocol in the Cypherpunk movement to consider how notions of power shaped the protocol. The protocol by design encompasses structures, namely Proof of Work and Trustlessness that reproduce asymmetrical constraints on the entities that comprise it. These constraining structures generate constraining mechanisms, those of cost effectiveness and deanonymisation, which further restrict participating entities' 'power to act', reinforcing others' 'power over' them. In doing so, I illustrate that the Bitcoin protocol, rather than decentralising and distributing power across a network of numerous anonymous, trustless peers, it has instead shifted it, from the traditional actors (e.g., state, regulators) to newly emergent ones.","[Zamani, Efpraxia D.] Univ Sheffield, Informat Sch, 211 Portobello, Sheffield S1 4DP, S Yorkshire, England","","Zamani, ED (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Informat Sch, 211 Portobello, Sheffield S1 4DP, S Yorkshire, England.","e.zamani@sheffield.ac.uk","","Zamani, Efpraxia/0000-0003-3110-7495","","","","","119","1","1","1","2","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1388-1957","1572-8439","","ETHICS INF TECHNOL","Ethics Inf.

The analysis reveals negative influences from the volatility index (VIX) to Bitcoin price (BTC), which ascertains that Bitcoin can not be considered a haven in fear sentiment. Due to the liquidity in economic downside risks, BTC may decrease with high VIX to hedge losses, increasing during low VIX periods. The empirical results conflict with the intertemporal capital asset pricing model, which underlines that the increasing VIX can promote the price of Bitcoin. In turn, BTC positively impacts VIX, which shows that Bitcoin price can be treated as the main indicator for a more comprehensive analysis of the fear index. Under severe global uncertainty and changeable fluctuation of market sentiment, investors can optimize investment decisions based on market fear sentiment. The government can also consider VIX to grasp the trend of BTC to participate in cryptocurrency speculation effectively.","[Su, Chi-Wei; Xi, Yuan; Tao, Ran; Umar, Muhammad] Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Tao, Ran] Qingdao Municipal Ctr Dis Control & Preventat, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China","","Tao, R (corresponding author), Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.;Tao, R (corresponding author), Qingdao Municipal Ctr Dis Control & Preventat, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.","taotao0212@163.com","","","National Social Science Fund of China [20BJY021]","National Social Science Fund of China","This research is partly supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (20BJY021).","","101","7","7","6","8","VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV","VILNIUS","SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA","2029-4913","2029-4921","","TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO","Technol.

Our calculation showed about 10(28) hashes have been generated during bitcoin mining around the world for securing the addition of 703,364 blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain. We introduced a concept of Recycling Hashes in the hope to (a) jump-start bespoke silicon (customized silicon) for reversible computing, (b) open up the possibility of Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work to be less energy-consuming in the future, (c) provide scientific value or new services, in the form of entropy pool or random numbers, to Internet users while still achieving the security level of Bitcoin of today, (d) decrease the old mining hardware e-waste by using them to recycle hashes to the entropy pool, and (e) solve the problem of low mining rewards. We found that the bit rates of the current irreversible bitcoin miners are millions of times as high as the existing Internet connections, so it would be difficult to send all the hashes generated in real-time via the Internet. Even if only 0.000000355% of the hashes can be recycled, it would still mean that 355 . 10(18) hashes (355 EH) would have been recycled since the beginning of Bitcoin. Storing all the hashes, so far, would need storage of 2.560 . 10(30) bits, and it is not currently possible to keep all of them. Our simulation of 10,000 bitcoin hashes showed that the occurrences of zeros and ones in bitcoin hashes are almost 50% and 50%, so it is an encouraging finding for seeding the Pseudorandom Number Generators. We also proposed a second coin for the Bitcoin blockchain, an inflationary coin with a different currency unit (BTCi), to motivate the entropy providers to keep the old mining hardware online. The proposed second coin might keep Bitcoin's security model safe in the future when the deflationary bitcoin (BTC or BTCd) block reward is becoming too low.","[Heinonen, Henri T.] Univ Jyvaskyla, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Semenov, Alexander] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL USA","","Heinonen, HT (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Jyvaskyla, Finland.","henri.t.heinonen@student.jyu.fi; asemenov@ufl.edu","","Heinonen, Henri/0000-0001-5961-3571; Semenov, Alexander/0000-0003-2691-4575"," [200092]","","We thank Professor Pekka Neittaanmaki and Professor Timo Hamalainen for discussions and feedback.

Adapting the proposal of Chang, Cheng and Khorana (2000) (CCK) to test conditional herding, we obtain results that indicate that the herding effect is significant during the week before expiration. After expiration, the herding effect lasts for a few hours and disappears. Information overload originating, among other causes, from sophisticated investors' strategies may generate this mimetic behaviour. The results show the relevance of intraday data applied to specific events such as expiration since the unconditional analysis shows, in general, anti-herding behaviour throughout the period of study.","[Blasco, N.; Satrustegui, N.] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Accounting & Finance, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Blasco, N.] Res Inst Employment Digital Soc & Sustainabil IED, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Corredor, P.] Publ Univ Navarre UPNA, Inst Adv Res Business & Econ INARBE, Dept Business Adm, Campus Arrosadia S-N, Pamplona 31006, Spain","","Blasco, N (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, Dept Accounting & Finance, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.;Blasco, N (corresponding author), Res Inst Employment Digital Soc & Sustainabil IED, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.","nblasco@unizar.es","Corredor, Pilar/G-7800-2015","Corredor, Pilar/0000-0003-1739-0095","ERDF A way of making Europe; Government of Aragon [S11_20R]; ERDF [S11_20R];  [PID2019-104304GB-I00];  [MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033];  [RTI2018-093483-B-I00]","ERDF A way of making Europe; Government of Aragon(Gobierno de Aragon); ERDF(European Commission); ; ; ","We sincerely thank the anonymous referees and the editor for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Our research objective was to answer the question of whether macroeconomic news from the U.S. affects Bitcoin in the same way it affects other common investment assets such as gold, the S&P 500, 2-year Treasury bills, and 10-year Treasury bills. Following previous research, seven macroeconomic news announcements from the U.S. were selected, and an empirical analysis of the daily returns, volatility, and volume of the selected assets was conducted. The results show that while Bitcoin is the most volatile (i.e., riskiest) of all the assets, the expected direction of movement is visible after the official announcement of the macroeconomic news on that day, and is comparable to that of the 2-year Treasury bills. It is also evident that the trading volume of Bitcoin does not change, unlike other assets, suggesting that the price of Bitcoin is always moved by the same players, indicating the closed and, therefore, riskier nature of cryptocurrency markets. Finally, we found evidence that the impact of macroeconomic announcements on Bitcoin returns is stronger when the announcements are negative but, interestingly, the returns of Bitcoin, unlike those of other assets, are more volatile after positive announcements.","[Muzic, Ivan] City Univ London, Bayes Business Sch, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Grzeta, Ivan] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ & Business, Rijeka 51000, Croatia","","Grzeta, I (corresponding author), Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ & Business, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.","ivan.muzic@bayes.city.ac.uk; ivan.grzeta@efri.hr","","","University of Rijeka [uniri-mladidrustv-20-5]","University of Rijeka","This work has been fully supported by the University of Rijeka project uniri-mladidrustv-20-5.","","58","1","1","1","1","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-9091","","RISKS","Risks","JUN","2022","10","6","","","","","","","123","10.3390/risks10060123","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/risks10060123","","","15","Business, Finance","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Business & Economics","2K5FN","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000816361600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, existing schemes are generally not scalable due to limitations associated with the anonymity set and self-credibility. In this article, we propose an efficient coin mixing scheme (hereafter referred to as CoinLayering). To achieve strong anonymity, CoinLayering randomly selects two sets of middlepersons to respectively execute Bitcoin holding and Bitcoin trading. The seller can also select lower-loaded sets of middlepersons in the shortest time possible. We also design two coin mixing protocols, CoinLayering-PA and CoinLayering-PB, to mitigate the risk due to misbehaving middlepersons and Supervisor. We then mathematically prove that CoinLayering achieves both strong anonymity and self-credibility, and evaluate its performance to demonstrate its scalability.","[Lu, Ning; Chang, Yuan; Shi, Wenbo] Northeastern Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110004, Peoples R China; [Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Informat Syst & Cyber Secur, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Comp Sci, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA","","Shi, WB (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110004, Peoples R China.;Choo, KKR (corresponding author), Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Informat Syst & Cyber Secur, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.;Choo, KKR (corresponding author), Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Comp Sci, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.","luning@neuq.edu.cn; 2233718749@qq.com; shiwb@neuq.edu.cn; raymond.choo@fulbrightmail.org","Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond/A-3634-2009","Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond/0000-0001-9208-5336; Lu, ning/0000-0001-7325-7307","National Natural Science Foundation of China [62072093, 62072092, 61601107, U1708262]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M653568]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [N2023020]; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province of China [F2020501013, 20310702D]; Cloud Technology Endowed Professorship; National Science Foundation (NSF) CREST [HRD-1736209]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province); Cloud Technology Endowed Professorship; National Science Foundation (NSF) CREST(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF- Directorate for Education & Human Resources (EHR))","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 62072093, 62072092, 61601107, and U1708262); in part by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No.2019M653568); in part by Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. N2023020); and in part by Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province of China (Nos.

A landmark security property of smart contracts is liquidity: in a non-liquid contract, it may happen that some assets remain frozen, i.e. not redeemable by anyone. The relevance of this issue is witnessed by recent liquidity attacks to Ethereum, which have frozen hundreds of USD millions. We address the problem of verifying liquidity on BitML, a DSL for smart contracts with a secure compiler to Bitcoin, featuring primitives for currency transfers, contract renegotiation and consensual recursion. Our main result is a verification technique for liquidity. We first transform the infinite-state semantics of BitML into a finite-state one, which focusses on the behaviour of a chosen set of contracts, abstracting from the moves of the context. With respect to the chosen contracts, this abstraction is sound, i.e. if the abstracted contract is liquid, then also the concrete one is such. We then verify liquidity by model-checking the finite-state abstraction. We implement a toolchain that automatically verifies liquidity of BitML contracts and compiles them to Bitcoin, and we assess it through a benchmark of representative contracts.","[Bartoletti, Massimo; Lande, Stefano] Univ Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy; [Murgia, Maurizio; Zunino, Roberto] Univ Trento, Trento, Italy","","Bartoletti, M (corresponding author), Univ Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.","bart@unica.it; lande@unica.it; maurizio.murgia@unitn.it; roberto.zunino@unitn.it","Murgia, Maurizio/AID-0150-2022","Murgia, Maurizio/0000-0001-7613-621X","Aut.

Firstly, this paper studies the multifractal and chaotic nonlinear characteristics of Bitcoin volatility by using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) and largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) methods. Then, from the perspective of nonlinearity, the measured values of multifractal and chaos show that the volatility of Bitcoin has short-term predictability. The study of chaos and multifractal dynamics in nonlinear systems is very important in terms of their predictability. The chaos signals may have short-term predictability, while multifractals and self-similarity can increase the likelihood of accurately predicting future sequences of these signals. Finally, we constructed a number of chaotic artificial neural network models to forecast the Bitcoin return???s volatility avoiding the model misspecification. The results show that chaotic artificial neural network models have good prediction effect by comparing these models with the existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. This is because the chaotic artificial neural network models can extract hidden patterns and accurately model time series from potential signals, while the benchmark ANN models are based on Gaussian kernel local approximation of non-stationary signals, so they cannot approach the global model with chaotic characteristics. At the same time, the multifractal parameters are further mined to obtain more market information to guide financial practice. These above findings matter for investors (especially for investors in quantitative trading) as well as effective supervision of financial institutions by government.","[Yin, Tao] East China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Business Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yiming] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China","","Yin, T (corresponding author), East China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Business Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China.","1701110936@pku.edu.cn; wangyiming@pku.edu.cn","","","","","","","49","0","0","3","3","TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC","LIBEREC 1","FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC","1212-3609","2336-5064","","E M EKON MANAG","E M Ekon.

Bitcoin on-chain data storage is over 338GB as of September 1, 2021. According to the exponential growth trend of block data, the size of a Bitcoin full node will exceed 500GB in two years. The huge storage problem makes it difficult for general users to store complete Bitcoin data conveniently, which weakens the decentralization capability of Bitcoin network. In this work, we propose an efficient storage scheme (ESS) based on the distribution characteristics of the unspent transaction outputs in Bitcoin network. ESS sets a UTXO-weight for each block. According to UTXO-weight, it dynamically prunes the blocks which have lower query frequency, improving the scalability of the Bitcoin network. When a new block is generated, ESS enables joining nodes to verify most of the transaction inputs instantly. Only a small amount of transaction outputs of older blocks need to be retrieved from the full node for payment verification. Experimental results demonstrated that ESS can reduce the size of a normal node in current Bitcoin network by about 82.14% at a low communication cost.","[Wang, Xiaoqing; Wang, Chunping; Zhou, Kun; Cheng, Hongbing] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310014, Peoples R China","","Cheng, HB (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310014, Peoples R China.","chenghb@zjut.edu.cn","","Cheng, Hongbing/0000-0002-8504-1092","National Nature Science Foundation of China [62072407, 61402413]; Nature Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LY19F020023]","National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Nature Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province)","This work was supported in part by the National Nature Science Foundation of China under Grant 62072407 and Grant 61402413, in part by the Nature Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province under Grant LY19F020023.","","46","2","2","6","6","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","1932-4537","","","IEEE T NETW SERV MAN","IEEE Trans.

However, the correlation becomes strong and significant in 2019 and 2020. Second, returns also differ among those connected addresses. By dividing the connected addresses into ten decile groups based on their centrality, we find that the top 20% most connected addresses earn higher returns than their peers during most of our sample period. Third, eigenvector centrality is more related to higher returns than degree centrality for the top 20% most-connected addresses, implying that the quality of connections may matter more than quantity among those highly connected addresses.","[Tsang, Kwok Ping] Virginia Tech, Dept Econ, Pamplin Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Yang, Zichao] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, Wuhan, Peoples R China","","Yang, ZC (corresponding author), Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, Wuhan, Peoples R China.","byront@vt.edu; yang_zichao@outlook.com","","Yang, Zichao/0000-0003-4169-9295","","","","","23","0","0","7","7","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0927-5398","1879-1727","","J EMPIR FINANC","J.

Currently, its ledger grows by the addition of blocks of similar to 2,000 transactions every 10 minutes. Intuitively, one would expect that increasing the block capacity would solve this scaling problem. However, we show that increasing the block capacity would be futile. We analyze strategic interactions of miners, who are heterogeneous in their power over block addition, and users, who are heterogeneous in the value of their transactions, using a game-theoretic model. We show that a capacity increase can facilitate large miners to tacitly collude-artificially reversing back the capacity via strategically adding partially filled blocks in order to extract economic rents. This strategic partial filling crowds out low-value payments. Collusion is sustained if the smallest colluding miner has a share of block addition power above a lower bound. We provide empirical evidence of such strategic partial filling of blocks by large miners of Bitcoin. We show that a protocol design intervention can breach the lower bound and eliminate collusion. However, this also makes the system less secure. On the one hand, collusion crowds out low-value payments; on the other hand, if collusion is suppressed, security threatens high-value payments. As a result, it is untenable to include a range of payments with vastly different outside options, willingness to bear security risk, and delay onto a single chain. Thus, we show economic limits to the scalability of Bitcoin. Under these economic limits, collusive rent extraction acts as as an effective mechanism to invest in platform security and build responsiveness to demand shocks. These traits are otherwise hard to attain in a disintermediated setting owing to the high cost of consensus.","[Malik, Nikhil] Univ Southern Calif, Mkt, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Aseri, Manmohan] Univ Pittsburgh, Informat Syst & Technol Management, Sewickley, PA 15143 USA; [Singh, Param Vir; Srinivasan, Kannan] Carnegie Mellon Univ, David A Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","","Malik, N (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Mkt, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.","maliknik@marshall.usc.edu; maseri@kalz.pitt.edu; psidhu@cmu.edu; kannans@andrew.cmu.edu","","Aseri, Manmohan/0000-0001-6943-2432; singh, param/0000-0002-0211-7849","Ripple's University Blockchain Research Initiative at Carnegie Mellon University","Ripple's University Blockchain Research Initiative at Carnegie Mellon University","This work was partially supported by the Ripple's University Blockchain Research Initiative at Carnegie Mellon University.","","50","0","0","29","42","INFORMS","CATONSVILLE","5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA","0025-1909","1526-5501","","MANAGE SCI","Manage.

From the empirical findings, we can observe that the presence of a short-term relationship between the variables with respect to the long-term relationship is significant and low. This result indicates the excessive volatility of bitcoin. The Granger causality test demonstrates the presence of unidirectional relationship between bitcoin and the variables representing energy and commodity products. Our paper contributes to the literature by applying for the first time many approaches together such as ARDL model, Granger Causality, Causality of Tada and Yamamoto, Cointegration relationship in short term and long term.","[Jouini, Fathi] Sousse Univ, Fac Econ Sci & Management Sousse, Dept Finance & Accounting, Sousse, Tunisia; [Messai, Ahlem Selma] King Faisal Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance, Al Hufuf, Saudi Arabia; [Derbali, Abdelkader Mohamed Sghaier] Taibah Univ, Appl Coll, Dept Adm & Financial Sci & Tech, Medinah, Saudi Arabia; [Derbali, Abdelkader Mohamed Sghaier] Kairouan Univ, Higher Inst Informat & Management Kairouan, Dept Finance & Accounting, Kairouan, Tunisia","","Derbali, AMS (corresponding author), Taibah Univ, Appl Coll, Dept Adm & Financial Sci & Tech, Medinah, Saudi Arabia.;Derbali, AMS (corresponding author), Kairouan Univ, Higher Inst Informat & Management Kairouan, Dept Finance & Accounting, Kairouan, Tunisia.","derbaliabdelkader@outlook.fr","","","","","","","33","0","0","0","0","WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD","SINGAPORE","5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE","2424-7863","2424-7944","","INT J FINANC ENG","Int.

However, the number of Bitcoin owners has risen exponentially, and relevant socioeconomic and political groups have become increasingly diverse. Consequently, this article argues that what has contributed to the global diffusion of Bitcoin and its embeddedness in different human societies is its practical indeterminacy. Practical indeterminacy characterizes the fundamentally undefinable, indeterminate nature of Bitcoin's value, as it can change its form depending on who it encounters. In terms of temporality, practically indeterminate Bitcoin can urge potential owners and users to compare their pasts and futures, thus driving them to perceive, own, and use Bitcoin for their own purposes. By paying attention to the agency of Bitcoin, practical indeterminacy explains how individuals form their own relations with Bitcoin and how these relations lead to Bitcoin's further sociocultural embeddedness. The proliferation of such a wide range of human-Bitcoin relations shows that Bitcoin is not only monetary but also cultural, as it offers different meanings to users and owners.","[Yokoyama, Yura] Brandeis Univ, Dept Anthropol, Waltham, MA 02453 USA","","Yokoyama, Y (corresponding author), Brandeis Univ, Dept Anthropol, Waltham, MA 02453 USA.","yurayokoyama@brandeis.edu","","","","","","","48","0","0","1","1","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA","2330-4847","","","ECON ANTHROPOL","Econ.

The model gained significant traction after successfully predicting the meteoric rise of Bitcoin prices from late 2020 to early 2021. This paper dissects the S2F model for Bitcoin empirically to determine its viability and investigate whether investors can profit from an S2F-based trading strategy. Design/methodology/approach This paper, dissects the S2F model for Bitcoin by putting it through a battery of tests to examine its design, characteristics, robustness and appropriateness. Findings Overall, this paper finds the S2F model to be insensitive to differing assumptions in the early stages of the model, alleviating concerns about data mining. This paper produces a dynamic S2F model with no peek-ahead bias and shows evidence that prediction accuracy increases over time. Finally, this paper shows that a dynamic trading strategy that goes long (short) when Bitcoin is undervalued (overvalued) according to S2F is far less profitable than a classic buy-and-hold strategy. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to analyze the S2F model in an academic setting by providing a rigorous assessment of the model's construction. This paper demonstrates how the model can be implemented realistically without the peek-ahead bias, creating a tool that can be used contemporaneously by investors.","[Morillon, Thibaut G.] Elon Univ, Dept Finance, Elon, NC 27244 USA; [Chacon, Ryan G.] Univ Colorado, Dept Finance, Colorado Springs, CO 80907 USA","","Morillon, TG (corresponding author), Elon Univ, Dept Finance, Elon, NC 27244 USA.","tmorillon@elon.edu","","Chacon, Ryan/0000-0002-6899-5468","","","","","48","0","0","0","0","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1086-7376","1755-6791","","STUD ECON FINANC","Stud.

Owing to the anonymity of its addresses, even though transaction flows are globally visible, Bitcoin clustering remains one of the most challenging and open problems in illegal Bitcoin transaction analysis. In this article, to resolve this problem, we propose a novel multi-layer heuristic algorithm for Bitcoin clustering, which leverages on-chain transactions as well as off-chain application data in the real world. For this purpose, we first explored the unique characteristics of darknet market ecosystems including their trading systems. By conducting an in-depth analysis of the data manually collected for 11 months, we found that some darknet market review data disclosed transactions containing Bitcoin value and item delivery information. We then identified unique Bitcoin addresses associated with the disclosed information, owned by the same darknet providers. Based on address ownership, more accurate market clusters could be created, which have not previously been identified by other clustering algorithms. According to our experimental results, approximately 31.68% of the darknet market review data matched real Bitcoin transactions, and 122 hidden clusters associated with Silk Road 4 were found. This indicates that the proposed algorithm can complement existing clustering methods and significantly reduce the false negative rate by up to 91.7%.","[Kim, Minjae; Lee, Jinhee; Hur, Junbeom] Korea Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Kwon, Hyunsoo] Samsung Elect, Suwon, South Korea","","Hur, J (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea.","jbhur@korea.ac.kr","","Lee, Jinhee/0000-0003-0019-4223","IITP Grant - Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea [2019-0-01697]; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, South Korea [NRF-2021R1A6A1A13044830]; Grant Institute for Information & communication Technology Planning & evaluation (IITP) [2022-2020-0-01819, IITP-2021-0-01810]","IITP Grant - Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, South Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea); Grant Institute for Information & communication Technology Planning & evaluation (IITP)","This work was supported in part by IITP Grant funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea, under Grant 2019-0-01697, Grant Institute for Information & communication Technology Planning & evaluation (IITP)-2022-2020-0-01819, and Grant IITP-2021-0-01810; and in part by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, South Korea, under Grant NRF-2021R1A6A1A13044830.","","57","0","0","2","2","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","70078","70091","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3187210","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3187210","","","14","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","3Q7BX","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000838383000001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Bitcoin has the characteristics of high anonymity, decentralization, peer-to-peer, and the use of asymmetric encryption. These high tech features make bitcoin a new criminal tool which often used by organized criminal groups. Therefore, analyzing bitcoin flow has become critical for law enforcement to conduct a criminal investigation. However, due to its UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) transaction pattern, many change wallets are generated in analyzing bitcoin flow, which affects the judgment of actual money flow analysis. In this research, we implement input-output differential and temporary rules to detect change wallets by analyzing bitcoin transaction pattern characteristics. Furthermore, we design web crawlers as a tool to collect and parse transactions of highly suspected criminal bitcoin wallets.

However, with the rapid growth of cryptocurrency transactions in recent years, the traditional static analysis models tend to ignore parameter changes in the evolution process. To solve this problem, constructing time-varying network model is an effective scheme. The main challenge of turning the massive statically stored transaction data into dynamical sequential network is to design a set of suitable network model. This paper took Bitcoin system as example, combined complex network evolution theory, proposed a weighted variable directed bipartite graph (VW-DBG) model. Initially, we defined the transaction weights and the influence inditcator of nodes, and accordingly introduced the node deletion mechanism to Bitcoin transaction network analysis for the first time. Moreover, information entropy indicators was defined to screen key periods in the evolution. In addition, we analyzed the dynamic and static indicators of real Bitcoin transaction network under different observation time using this model, and revealed the pow-law distribution in evolutionary networks.","[Geng, Jinke; Fang, Li] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Beijing Lab Adv Informat Networks, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China; [Li, Yi] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Minist Educ, Key Lab Universal Wireless Commun, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ping] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China","","Li, Y (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Minist Educ, Key Lab Universal Wireless Commun, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.","JackGeng@bupt.edu.cn; liyi@bupt.edu.cn; fangli@bupt.edu.cn; rab1106@bupt.edu.cn","","","Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks Open Project Financial Support","Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks Open Project Financial Support","This work was supported by the Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks Open Project Financial Support.","","21","0","0","2","2","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA","2327-4697","","","IEEE T NETW SCI ENG","IEEE Trans.

However, results of those studies generally remain inconsistent in terms of not only the true combination of factors that affect Bitcoin prices, but also the nature of effects (positive vs. negative) that each individual factor has on the price behavior. The present study investigates the robustness of a wide variety of candidate determinants that have been the focus of attention in relevant literature. Our inquiry relies on the extreme bounds analysis (EBA), which is a type of large-scale sensitivity analysis capable of addressing model uncertainty issues. The findings suggest that crypto market forces of supply and demand, public interest, and economic policy uncertainty are the only variables robust to all possible variations in the conditioning information set. Our evidence argues in favor of the predominance of cryptocurrency-related determinants over global macroeconomic and financial ones in explaining Bitcoin price movements.","[Ahmed, Walid M.

This study aims to analyse the volatility dynamics of the returns of Bitcoin. An asymmetric GARCH model (EGARCH) is used to investigate whether Bitcoin may be useful in risk management and ideal for risk-averse investors in anticipation of negative shocks to the market (leverage effect). This paper also examines Bitcoin as an investment and hedge alternative to gold as well as NSE NIFTY using a multivariate DCC GARCH model. DCC GARCH models are also used to check whether correlation (co-movement) between the markets is time-varying, examine returns and volatility spillovers between markets and the effect of the outbreak of COVID-19 in India on the investigated markets. The results show that given the supply of Bitcoin is fixed, low returns realisation is equivalent to excess supply over demand wherein investors are selling off Bitcoin during bad times. The positive co-movement between Bitcoin and gold during the COVID-19 outbreak shows that investors perceived Bitcoin as a relatively safe investment. However, overall analysis shows that Bitcoin was not considered a safe hedge and an investment option by Indian investors during the study period.","[Murty, Sarika] CHRIST Deemed Be Univ, Dept Econ, Bangalore 560029, Karnataka, India; [Victor, Vijay] Manipal Acad Higher Educ, TA Pai Management Inst, Accounting Econ & Finance Area, Manipal 576104, India; [Fekete-Farkas, Maria] Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Inst Agr & Food Econ, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary","","Fekete-Farkas, M (corresponding author), Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Inst Agr & Food Econ, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary.","sarika.murty@eco.christuniversity.in; vijay.victor@manipal.edu; farkasne.fekete.maria@uni-mate.hu","Fekete-Farkas, Maria/ABI-4516-2020; Victor, Vijay/J-8649-2019","Fekete-Farkas, Maria/0000-0002-6058-009X; Victor, Vijay/0000-0002-0885-5578","","","","","51","0","0","1","1","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

Why is bitcoin using so much energy? Most of the energy is used during the bitcoin mining process, which serves at least two significant purposes: a) distributing new cryptocurrency coins to the cryptoeconomy and b) securing the Bitcoin blockchain ledger. In reality, the comparison of bitcoin transactions to Visa transactions is not that simple. The amount of transactions in the Bitcoin network is not directly connected to the amount of bitcoin mining power nor the energy consumption of those mining devices; for example, it is possible to multiply the number of bitcoin transactions per second without increasing the mining power and the energy consumption. Bitcoin is not only digital money for hackers. It has very promising future potential as a global reserve currency and a method to make the World Wide Web (WWW) immune to cyberattacks such as the Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks. This survey approached cryptocurrencies' various technological and environmental issues from many different perspectives. To make various cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), greener and more justified, what technological solutions do we have? We found that cryptocurrency mining might be cleaner than is generally expected. There is also a plan to make a vast renewable energy source available by combining Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion and Bitcoin mining. There are plans to use unconventional computing methods (quantum computing, reversible computing, ternary computing, optical computing, analog computing) to solve some of the issues regarding the vast energy consumption of conventional computing (including cryptocurrency mining). We think using spare computing cycles for grid computing efforts is justified. For example, there are billions of smartphones in the world. Many smartphones are being recharged every day. If this daily recharging period of twenty to sixty minutes would be used for grid computing, for example, finding new cures to cancer, it would probably be a significant breakthrough for medical research simulations. We call cryptocurrency communities to research and develop grid computing and unconventional computing methods for the most significant cryptocurrencies: bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).","[Heinonen, Henri T.; Veijalainen, Jari; Hamalainen, Timo] Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Informat Technol, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Semenov, Alexander] Univ Florida, Herbert Wertheim Coll Engn, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Shalimar, FL 32579 USA","","Heinonen, HT (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Informat Technol, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.","henri.t.heinonen@student.jyu.fi","","Hamalainen, Timo/0000-0002-4168-9102; Veijalainen, Jari/0000-0001-5809-5848; Heinonen, Henri/0000-0001-5961-3571","","","","","151","0","0","4","4","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","74792","74814","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3190891","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3190891","","","23","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","3Q8UN","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000838499500001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Such behavior can be a source of systemic risk and increasing distrust for the market participants, consequences that call for viable countermeasures. Building on the foundations provided by the extant literature, this study aims to design an agent-based market model capable of reproducing the behavior of the Bitcoin market during the time of an alleged Bitcoin price manipulation that occurred between 2017 and early 2018. The model includes the mechanisms of a limit order book market and several agents associated with different trading strategies, including a fraudulent agent, initialized from empirical data and who performs market manipulation. The model is validated with respect to the Bitcoin price as well as the amount of Bitcoins obtained by the fraudulent agent and the traded volume. Simulation results provide a satisfactory fit to historical data. Several price dips and volume anomalies are explained by the actions of the fraudulent trader, completing the known body of evidence extracted from blockchain activity. The model suggests that the presence of the fraudulent agent was essential to obtain Bitcoin price development in the given time period; without this agent, it would have been very unlikely that the price had reached the heights as it did in late 2017. The insights gained from the model, especially the connection between liquidity and manipulation efficiency, unfold a discussion on how to prevent illicit behavior.","[Fratric, Peter; Sileno, Giovanni; Klous, Sander; van Engers, Tom] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Informat, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Engers, Tom] Univ Amsterdam, Leibniz Inst, TNO, Amsterdam, Netherlands","","Fratric, P (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Inst Informat, Amsterdam, Netherlands.","p.fratric@uva.nl","","Fratric, Peter/0000-0001-6378-5886","Marie Sklodowska-Curie ITN Horizon 2020 [765710]; NWO-Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [KIVI.2019.006]","Marie Sklodowska-Curie ITN Horizon 2020; NWO-Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO))","Funding was provided by Marie Sklodowska-Curie ITN Horizon 2020-funded project INSIGHTS (call H2020-MSCAITN-2017, grant agreement n.765710); and NWO-Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (Award Number: KIVI.2019.006 HUMAINER AI project).","","69","0","0","4","4","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","2199-4730","","FINANC INNOV","Financ.

Gold and Bitcoin respond positively to equity valuation and safe assets categories of financial stress. Gold also reacts positively to the credit category of financial stress suggesting that widening credit spreads are bullish for gold. Bitcoin and gold respond differently in the funding category, and there is no significant reaction to volatility-related financial stress. Overall, the effects of categorical financial stress on gold and Bitcoin are similar in the full sample and sub-sample before COVID-19, but the effects are heterogeneous. Interestingly, during the pandemic, the reactions of gold and Bitcoin to categorical financial stress have changed. Gold only reacts positively to the credit category of financial stress across quantiles. Bitcoin reacts positively to credit and safe asset categories but not across all quantiles.

We find that Bitcoin is a prime example of an asset for which the two concepts of volatility diverge. We show that, historically, Bitcoin combines high Standard Deviation and low Approximate Entropy, relative to Gold and S&P 500. Moreover, subsample analysis for different time-scales (daily, weekly, monthly) shows that lower sampling frequencies drastically reduce the Kurtosis of the distribution of log-returns of Bitcoin. The opposite effect is observed for Gold and S&P 500. These properties suggest that, contrary to the volatility of the two traditional assets, Bitcoin's high volatility is essentially an intra-day phenomenon that is strongly attenuated for a weekly or monthly time-preference.","[Dehouche, Nassim] Mahidol Univ Int Coll, Business Adm Div, Salaya, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand","","Dehouche, N (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ Int Coll, Business Adm Div, Salaya, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.","nassim.deh@mahidol.edu","","","","","","","27","1","1","8","14","TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS","OSLO","KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY","2332-2039","","","COGENT ECON FINANC","Cogent Econ.

The empirical analyses are carried out using the wavelet coherence approach and dynamic frequency-domain connectedness method. Our results generally indicate that the volatility dynamics between bitcoin and the financial assets are weak or negative before the pandemic while they become positive during the pandemic times for most of the assets. Further, the volatility connectedness for bitcoin-gold and bitcoin-foreign exchange pairs is most significant in the short term, while it is significant in the intermediate term for bitcoin-oil and bitcoin-equity pairs during the pandemic. We examine optimal portfolios to hedge Bitcoin shocks at multiple investment horizons during the pandemic.

As the most famous cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin price forecasting model is one of the popular mathematical models in financial technology because of its large price fluctuations and complexity. This paper proposes a novel ensemble deep learning model to predict Bitcoin's next 30 min prices by using price data, technical indicators and sentiment indexes, which integrates two kinds of neural networks, long short-term memory (LSTM) and gate recurrent unit (GRU), with stacking ensemble technique to improve the accuracy of decision. Because of the real-time updates of comments on social media, this paper uses social media texts instead of news websites as the source data of public opinion. It is processed by linguistic statistical method to form the sentiment indexes. Meanwhile, as a financial market forecasting model, the model selects the technical indicators as input as well. Real data from September 2017 to January 2021 is used to train and evaluate the model. The experimental results show that the near-real time prediction has a better performance, with a mean absolute error (MAE) 88.74% better than the daily prediction. The purpose of this work is to explain our solution and show that the ensemble method has better performance and can better help investors in making the right investment decision than other traditional models.","[Ye, Zi; Wu, Yinxu; Chen, Hui; Pan, Yi; Jiang, Qingshan] Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China","","Jiang, QS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.","zi.ye@siat.ac.cn; wyx83coria@hotmail.com; hui.chenl@siat.ac.cn; yi.pan@siat.ac.cn; qs.jiang@siat.ac.cn","","Jiang, Qingshan/0000-0002-8040-0308; Chen, Hui/0000-0002-5703-9454; YE, ZI/0000-0003-2940-0422; Wu, Yinxu/0000-0003-0555-6991","Hebei Academy of Sciences under research fund [22602]; National Key Research and Development Program of China under fund [2021YFF1200104]","Hebei Academy of Sciences under research fund; National Key Research and Development Program of China under fund","This work is supported by the Hebei Academy of Sciences under research fund No. 22602 and the National Key Research and Development Program of China under fund No. 2021YFF1200104.","","44","1","1","10","10","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-7390","","MATHEMATICS-BASEL","Mathematics","APR","2022","10","8","","","","","","","1307","10.3390/math10081307","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math10081307","","","21","Mathematics","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Mathematics","0S4XF","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000786278000001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

While proponents consider Bitcoin trading to be '24/7', our findings suggest that both transaction and on-chain network activity are best described to be, at best, '12/5', presenting significant implications for traders, with regards to centralised exchange liquidity and the speed of their transaction inclusion on the blockchain.

Several models, from GARCH type to jump-diffusion type, have been developed to dynamically capture the price movement of this highly volatile asset. While fitting the Gaussian and the Generalized Hyperbolic and the Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) distributions to log-returns of Bitcoin, NIG distribution appears to provide the best fit. The time-varying Hurst parameter for Bitcoin price reveals periods of randomness and mean-reverting type of behaviour, motivating the study in this paper through fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck driven by a Normal Inverse Gaussian Levy process. Features such as long-range memory are jump diffusion processes that are well captured with this model. The results present a 95% prediction for the price of Bitcoin for some specific dates. This study contributes to the literature of Bitcoin price forecasts that are useful for Bitcoin options traders.","[Mba, Jules Clement; Mwambi, Sutene Mwambetania] Univ Johannesburg, Sch Econ, Coll Business & Econ, POB 524 Auckland Pk, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Pindza, Edson] Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept Math & Stat, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Pindza, Edson] Univ Pretoria, Dept Math & Appl Math, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa","","Mba, JC (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Sch Econ, Coll Business & Econ, POB 524 Auckland Pk, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.","jmba@uj.ac.za; sutenem@uj.ac.za; edsonpindza@gmail.com","","Mba, Jules Clement/0000-0001-6462-6385; Pindza, Edson/0000-0003-3207-8067; mwambi, sutene/0000-0003-3410-4724","","","","","21","0","0","1","1","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2571-9394","","FORECASTING-BASEL","Forecasting","JUN","2022","4","2","","","","","409","419","","10.3390/forecast4020023","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/forecast4020023","","","11","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","2N4HO","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000818342400001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Given that the persistence of high levels of energy consumption of Bitcoin could have permanent policy implications, we examine the presence of long memory in the daily data of the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index (BECI) (BECI upper bound, BECI lower bound, and BECI average) covering the period 25 February 2017 to 25 January 2022. Employing fractionally integrated GARCH (FIGARCH) and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) models to estimate the order of fractional integrating parameter and compute the Hurst exponent, which measures long memory, this study shows that distant series observations are strongly autocorrelated and long memory exists in most cases, although mean-reversion is observed at the first difference of the data series. Such evidence for the profound presence of long memory suggests the suitability of applying permanent policies regarding the use of alternate energy for mining; otherwise, transitory policy would quickly become obsolete. We also suggest the replacement of 'proof-of-work' with 'proof-of-space' or 'proof-of-stake', although with a trade-off (possible security breach) to reduce the carbon footprint, the implementation of direct tax on mining volume, or the mandatory use of carbon credits to restrict the environmental damage.","[Ghosh, Bikramaditya] Symbiosis Int Deemed Univ SIU, Symbiosis Inst Business Management SIBM, Bengaluru 560017, India; [Bouri, Elie] Lebanese Amer Univ, Sch Business, POB 13-5053, Beirut, Lebanon","","Ghosh, B (corresponding author), Symbiosis Int Deemed Univ SIU, Symbiosis Inst Business Management SIBM, Bengaluru 560017, India.;Bouri, E (corresponding author), Lebanese Amer Univ, Sch Business, POB 13-5053, Beirut, Lebanon.","b.ghosh@sibm.edu.in; elie.elbouri@lau.edu.lb","Bouri, Elie/N-1368-2015","Bouri, Elie/0000-0003-2628-5027; Ghosh, Bikramaditya/0000-0003-0686-7046","","","","","41","1","1","1","1","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1099-4300","","ENTROPY-SWITZ","Entropy","MAY","2022","24","5","","","","","","","647","10.3390/e24050647","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e24050647","","","12","Physics, Multidisciplinary","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Physics","1Q2QU","35626532","Green Published, gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000802539600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The researchers are exploring its various repercussions for socioeconomic and political matters; however, the literature still lacks clear evidence on how bitcoin interacts with energy and the environment. This study aims to explore the causal relationship between bitcoin, clean energy, and carbon emissions allowances by applying the novel time-varying Granger causality test on the daily data spanning from Sept 17, 2014, to October 12, 2021. The empirical findings confirm that both clean energy and emission allowances are causally associated with bitcoin. However, this causal relationship varies over time and the duration of causality is longer as suggested by the recursive evolving procedure. The outcome is robust when bitcoin is measured by the volume and the price. Furthermore, the results obtained from robustness analysis conducted through heteroskedastic consistent test also validate the findings that bitcoin causes clean energy and carbon allowance. The findings offer a platform for government officials and policy managers to improve clean energy and carbon allowance markets for sustainable development by managing and using the tools to control and regulate cryptocurrency markets.","[Dogan, Eyup] Univ Sharjah, Finance & Econ, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Dogan, Eyup] Abdullah Gul Univ, Dept Econ, Kayseri, Turkey; [Majeed, Muhammad Tariq; Luni, Tania] Quaid I Azam Univ, Sch Econ, Islamabad, Pakistan","","Dogan, E (corresponding author), Univ Sharjah, Finance & Econ, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.","eyup.dogan@agu.edu.tr; tariq@qau.edu.pk; tania_luni@yahoo.com","Luni, Tania/AFT-2328-2022; Dogan, Eyup/GLQ-7992-2022","Luni, Tania/0000-0002-7022-1920; Dogan, Eyup/0000-0003-0476-5177; Majeed, Muhammad Tariq/0000-0001-9374-5025","","","","","40","2","2","15","15","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0959-6526","1879-1786","","J CLEAN PROD","J.

This paper aims to investigate how the EPU affects diversification of commodity, conventional, Islamic and sustainable equity returns in relation to its impact on Bitcoin returns. Design/methodology/approach The authors use advanced time-series econometrics, namely, multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic-dynamic conditional correlation and continuous wavelet transformation, for the analysis of the daily returns for the aforementioned assets between 01 August 2011 and 01 September 2019. Findings First, the authors found a strong evidence of Bitcoin's mean reverting trend in the long run while its volatility has decreased significantly since 2013. After separating the EPU into two regimes (high and low), diversification opportunities with Bitcoin seems to disappear in a high EPU period, while the hedging opportunity tends to prevail in a low EPU period for all classes of assets. Importantly, the findings indicate that Bitcoin offers short-term diversification for sustainable and Islamic equity as well as energy stocks during a low uncertainty period. Consequently, in relation to the policy uncertainty, Bitcoin provides similar hedging opportunities than commodities like Gold and Silver. Overall, the study shows that EPU is remarkably important in explaining the average portfolio returns of Bitcoin, suggesting that this indicator can be perceived as a decent explanatory factor for portfolio diversification. Originality/value The study significantly extends the empirical literature of Bitcoin's portfolio diversification by taking EPU into consideration. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is one of the few studies to investigate the asymmetric effects of US EPU on Bitcoin's hedging capabilities by taking into account major conventional equity, sustainable equity, Islamic equity, gold, silver and oil.","[Ali, Md Hakim] Univ Southampton Malaysia, Southampton Malaysia Business Sch, Iskandar Puteri, Malaysia; [Schinckus, Christophc] Univ Fraser Valley, Sch Business, Abbotsford, BC, Canada; [Uddin, Md Akther] Univ Creat Technol Chittagong, Dept Business Adm, Chittagong, Bangladesh; [Pahlevansharif, Saeed] Taylors Univ, Fac Business & Law, Subang Jaya, Malaysia","","Uddin, MA (corresponding author), Univ Creat Technol Chittagong, Dept Business Adm, Chittagong, Bangladesh.","aktherpu@gmail.com","","","","","","","58","0","0","4","4","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1086-7376","1755-6791","","STUD ECON FINANC","Stud.

However, it is a challenging task to foresee the exchange rate of the Bitcoin, due to its high volatility. Further, in the cryptocurrency market, it is vital to predict the Bitcoin price, which leads to high budgetary advantages and fences against market risks. This paper introduces a new bitcoin prediction model that includes three major phases: data collection, Feature Extraction, and Prediction. The initial phase is data collection, where Bitcoin raw data are collected, from which the features are extracted in the Features Extraction phase. The feature extraction is a unique mechanism for detecting the bitcoin prices on day-by-day and minute-by-minute. The indexed data collected are computed regarding certain standard indicators like average true range, exponential moving average, relative strength index, and rate of change. These technical indicators based features are subjected to the prediction phase. As the major contribution, the prediction process is made precisely by deploying an improved deep belief network model, whose weights and activation function are fine-tuned using a new modified Lion Algorithm referred to as Lion Algorithm with Adaptive Price Size. Finally, the performance of the proposed work is compared and proved its superiority over other conventional models.","[Rajakumar, B.

However, the factors with predictability power over its price are not widely studied. Therefore, this study aims to explore the factors that determine bitcoin prices. The analysis explores the determinants belonging to four categories - macro economic, financial, technical and fundamental factors. Design/methodology/approach The study employs random effects regression on the panel data of five countries. Then Granger causality test is applied on the time series of all the variables. Lastly, diagnostic tests are conducted to confirm the findings to be robust and reliable. Findings The findings suggest that oil price, bitcoin supply, trading volume and market capitalization significantly impact the price of bitcoin in the long run. In short run, bitcoin returns are only caused by oil price and market capitalization. Interestingly, bitcoin returns influence its attractiveness to investors, market capitalization, S&P 500 returns and trading volume, in the short run. Practical implications The technical analysis is found to be redundant in the short run. In the long run, technical as well as fundamental analysis are useful. The bitcoin is found to be a good diversification tool as it has no linkages with the stock markets and gold market. It is also an inflationary hedger owing its limited supply. Originality/value The studies on cryptocurrency market have not conducted the analysis across countries. This study captures the cross-sectional effects along with time effects. The study also includes 17 variables belonging to four categories.","[Dubey, Priti] Univ Delhi, Fac Management Studies, New Delhi, India","","Dubey, P (corresponding author), Univ Delhi, Fac Management Studies, New Delhi, India.","pritidubey.17@fms.edu","","Dubey, Priti/0000-0002-3077-2074","","","","","32","0","0","4","4","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1940-5979","1940-5987","","REV BEHAV FINANCE","Rev.

In this paper, the power-law distribution that the Bitcoin network obeys is given with mathematical proof, while traditional de-anonymous methods such as clustering fail to satisfy it. Therefore, considering the profit-oriented characteristics of Bitcoin traders in such occasion, we put forward a de-anonymous heuristic approach that recognizes and analyzes the behavioral patterns of financial High-Frequency Transactions(HFT), with realtime exchange rate of Bitcoin involved. With heuristic approach used for de-anonymity, algorithm that deals with the adjacency matrix and transition probability matrix are also put forward, which then makes it possible to apply clustering to the IP matching method. Basing on the heuristic approach and additional algorithm for clustering, finally we established the de-anonymous method that matches the activity information of the IP with the transaction records in blockchain. Experiments on IP matching method are applied to the actual data. It turns out that similar behavioral pattern between IP and transaction records are shown, which indicates the superiority of IP matching method.","[Long, Teng] China Univ Geosci, Sch Informat Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jiasheng; Wang, Xinbing] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Fu, Luoyi] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China","","Long, T (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Informat Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.","longteng@cugb.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [62002332]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62002332).","","25","0","0","0","0","CHINA INST COMMUNICATIONS","BEIJING","NO 13 WEST CHANG AN AVENUE, BEIJING, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA","1673-5447","","","CHINA COMMUN","China Commun.","JUN","2022","19","6","","","","","263","278","","10.23919/JCC.2022.06.019","http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2022.06.019","","","16","Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Telecommunications","2O2EE","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000818877000023","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Because of its extreme volatility, it requires accurate forecasts to build economic decisions. Although prior research has utilized machine learning to improve Bitcoin price prediction accuracy, few have looked into the plausibility of using multiple modeling approaches on datasets containing varying data types and volumetric attributes. Thus, this paper aims to propose a bitcoin price prediction model. Design/methodology/approach In this research work, a bitcoin price prediction model is introduced by following three major phases: Data collection, feature extraction and price prediction. Initially, the collected Bitcoin time-series data will be preprocessed and the original features will be extracted. To make this work good-fit with a high level of accuracy, we have been extracting the second order technical indicator based features like average true range (ATR), modified-exponential moving average (M-EMA), relative strength index and rate of change and proposed decomposed inter-day difference. Subsequently, these extracted features along with the original features will be subjected to prediction phase, where the prediction of bitcoin price value is attained precisely from the constructed two-level ensemble classifier. The two-level ensemble classifier will be the amalgamation of two fabulous classifiers: optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long/short-term memory (BiLSTM). To cope up with the volatility characteristics of bitcoin prices, it is planned to fine-tune the weight parameter of CNN by a new hybrid optimization model. The proposed hybrid optimization model referred as black widow updated rain optimization (BWURO) model will be conceptual blended of rain optimization algorithm and black widow optimization algorithm. Findings The proposed work is compared over the existing models in terms of convergence, MAE, MAPE, MARE, MSE, MSPE, MRSE, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), RMSPE and RMSRE, respectively. These evaluations have been conducted for both algorithmic performance as well as classifier performance. At LP = 50, the MAE of the proposed work is 0.023372, which is 59.8%, 72.2%, 62.14% and 64.08% better than BWURO + Bi-LSTM, CNN + BWURO, NN + BWURO and SVM + BWURO, respectively. Originality/value In this research work, a new modified EMA feature is extracted, which makes the bitcoin price prediction more efficient. In this research work, a two-level ensemble classifier is constructed in the price prediction phase by blending the Bi-LSTM and optimized CNN, respectively. To deal with the volatility of bitcoin values, a novel hybrid optimization model is used to fine-tune the weight parameter of CNN.","[Kundra, Harish] Guru Nanak Inst, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Tech Campus, Hyderabad, India; [Sharma, Sudhir] Manipal Univ Jaipur, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Dept Informat Technol, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India; [Nancy, P.] SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Comp, Dept Comp Technol, Kattankulathur Campus, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; [Kalyani, Dasari] VNR Vignana Jyothi Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Informat Technol, Hyderabad, India","","Kundra, H (corresponding author), Guru Nanak Inst, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Tech Campus, Hyderabad, India.","drhkundra@gniindia.org","","","","","","","44","0","0","5","5","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","0368-492X","1758-7883","","KYBERNETES","Kybernetes","","","","","","","","","","","","10.1108/K-11-2021-1213","http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/K-11-2021-1213","","JUL 2022","27","Computer Science, Cybernetics","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science","2Y9IY","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000826202200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

For this purpose, the volatility of Bitcoin returns is modeled using daily data of the Bitcoin / United States Dollar exchange rate. By comparing discrete-time models according to information criteria and likelihood values, the All-GARCH model with Johnson's-SU innovations is found as the most adequate model. The persistence of the volatility and half-life of the volatility of the returns are calculated according to the estimation of the discrete model.This discrete model has been compared with the continuous model in which the Levy increments are derived from the compound Poisson process using various error measurements. In conclusion, it is found that the continuous-time GARCH model shows a better performance in predicting volatility.","[Ari, Yakup] Alanya Alaaddin Keykubat Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Alanya, Turkey","","Ari, Y (corresponding author), Alanya Alaaddin Keykubat Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Alanya, Turkey.","yakup.ari@alanya.edu.tr","ARI, YAKUP/AAZ-1644-2020","ARI, YAKUP/0000-0002-5666-5365","","","","","46","0","0","1","1","EGE UNIV, FAC ECONOMICS & ADMIN SCIENCES","BORNOVA","DEPT BUSINESS ADMIN, BORNOVA, 35100, TURKEY","1303-099X","","","EGE ACAD REV","Ege Acad.

To fill this void, this study proposes a novel data decomposition-based hybrid bidirectional deep-learning model in forecasting the daily price change in the Bitcoin market and conducting algorithmic trading on the market. Two primary steps are involved in our methodology framework, namely, data decomposition for inner factors extraction and bidirectional deep learning for forecasting the Bitcoin price. Results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other benchmark models, including econometric models, machine-learning models, and deep-learning models. Furthermore, the proposed model achieved higher investment returns than all benchmark models and the buy-and-hold strategy in a trading simulation.

A comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of mining pool is essential to the Bitcoin network supervision as well as the reduction of carbon emission. However, due to the difficulty of obtaining mining pool internal data, the current evaluation is limited to a single mining power indicator. In this article, we build a four-layer mining pool evaluation model, named BMP, based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The model contains three first-level indicators and nine second-level indicators, covering various aspects of the performance of mining pool. Miner address extraction provides basic data for the calculation of these indicators. By utilizing the model proposed, we evaluated and ranked eight mainstream mining pools, which broadcasted 71.69% of the blocks during the period January 1, 2021-July 31, 2021. Through comparative analysis of evaluation result, we find that the 65% decline of mining power in June did not pose a threat to the stability of Bitcoin system.

This phenomenon is not well understood, also because of the lack of a precise pool-hoppers detection solution. In this paper, we propose a methodology for detecting the pool-hopping behavior in the Bitcoin network; we propose a deterministic framework exploiting the different time windowing phases (rounds, epochs) involved in the rewarding process. Our methodology includes a new algorithm to identify the miners, and a new algorithm to trace the revenue stream distribution. We assess the performance of our approach for the five mining pools with the highest hash rates during two three-month period in 2020 and 2021: we show that the phenomenon is still advantageous in terms of overall gains for the pool-hoppers. We also assess the fairness in stake: the phenomenon was known to be unfair in the beginning of the Bitcoin network due to the simple rewarding methods in place at that time, with single rewards higher for pool-hoppers than for miners; we show that this is no longer true and that the new rewarding policies now guarantee that pool-hopping is fair with respect to miners that do not perform pool-hopping. Nonetheless, we also show that the cumulative gain over time of pool-hoppers can be higher by 33% on median than static miners.","[Cortesi, Eugenio; Secci, Stefano; Taktak, Sami] Conservatoire Natl Arts & Metiers, Paris, France; [Cortesi, Eugenio; Bruschi, Francesco] Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy","","Secci, S (corresponding author), Conservatoire Natl Arts & Metiers, Paris, France.","stefano.secci@cnam.fr","","Secci, Stefano/0000-0002-6129-0676","","","","","27","0","0","3","3","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1389-1286","1872-7069","","COMPUT NETW","Comput.

Performance modeling can be used to provide us with a deeper understanding of the behavior and dynamics within blockchain peer-to-peer networks. Blockchain system architects can leverage network models to properly tune their system and to reduce design costs significantly. In this article, we focus on the original and well-established Bitcoin blockchain network. In particular, we propose a random graph model for performance modeling and analysis of the inventory-based protocol for block dissemination. This model addresses the impact of key blockchain parameters on the overall performance of Bitcoin. We derive some explicit and closed-form equations for block propagation delay and traffic overhead in the Bitcoin network. We also adapt our model to study the impact of deploying a relay network and investigate the effect of the relay network size on the network performance and decentralization. We implement our model using the popular network simulator OMNet++. We validate the accuracy of our theoretical model and its implementation with our dataset mined from the Bitcoin network. Our results show the tradeoff between the default number of connections per node, network bandwidth, and block size in order to compute the optimal block propagation delay over the network. Additionally, we found that bigger relay networks can jeopardize the decentralization of the Bitcoin network.","[Shahsavari, Yahya; Zhang, Kaiwen; Talhi, Chamseddine] Univ Quebec, Dept Software & IT Engn, Ecole Technol Super, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada","","Shahsavari, Y (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Dept Software & IT Engn, Ecole Technol Super, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.","yahya.shahsavari.1@ens.etsmtl.ca; kaiwen.zhang@etsmtl.ca; chamseddine.talhi@etsmtl.ca","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and Bitfarms Co.","","49","10","10","8","8","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","0018-9391","1558-0040","","IEEE T ENG MANAGE","IEEE Trans.

The objective is to develop price estimation methods. The methodology is to present five differential equation models estimated against the 23 July 2010-21 June 2021 Bitcoin data. The findings are that Gompertz growth fits the damped oscillations and lengthening cycles well, and tracks the early data better with the weighted least squares method. Gompertz growth combined with charged capacitor growth tracks the early data even better. Logistic growth is too slow to track the early data. Logistic growth combined with charged capacitor growth to some extent tracks the early data. Pure charged capacitor growth is unrealistic. The dates for the future bull market maxima depend to a low degree on the growth model carrying capacity approached asymptotically, assumed to match gold at $10 trillion, and to be 50 times higher. The implications for traders are to focus on the large standard deviations. Investors should understand the growth potential compared with other asset classes.

This excess energy could make a profit if it was used and managed effectively. Bitcoin, with its recent boom, associated market values, and excessive energy consumption during mining presents a win-win proposition for managing renewable energy curtailments. Therefore, in a bid to minimize renewable energy curtailments from the perspective of the independent system operator (ISO) while maximizing the profit for the investor, this study attempts to discover the optimal planning and operation of a bitcoin mining farm to minimize renewable energy curtailments. Specifically, renewable energy curtailments for the Energy Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) at an hourly resolution and the difficulty and price, respectively of bitcoin mining during 2020 and 2021, were considered in our analysis of the cost and profitability of bitcoin mining using curtailed renewable power. Besides, a greenhouse gas (GHG) analysis was also conducted to evaluate the annual emissions from each of the cases considered in this study. The results demonstrated that 93% of the curtailed energy could be used at a minimal cost to generate a $239 million profit. From an investor's perspective, 69.8% of the curtailed power could be used to generate a profit of $605 million. Cost minimization case scenario had the least amount of emissions followed by profit maximization case with penalty scenario. Sensitivity analyses and Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to investigate the effect of system parameters on the optimization results for an in-depth analysis of possible policy and investment decisions from the perspectives of both the ISOs and investors. Despite the uncertainties associated with the price of bitcoin, it was estimated that ERCOT, with its current renewable energy curtailments, would still be profitable in the case of profit maximization if the bitcoin price remains above $6800 throughout the year. Accordingly, bitcoin mining has substantial potential for becoming an effective medium to prevent renewable energy curtailments and turn energy oversupply into profit.","[Niaz, Haider; Liu, Jay J.] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea; [Niaz, Haider; You, Fengqi] Cornell Univ, Robert Frederick Smith Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Liu, Jay J.] Pukyong Natl Univ, Inst Cleaner Prod Technol, Busan 48547, South Korea","","You, FQ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Robert Frederick Smith Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.","jayliu@pknu.ac.kr; fengqi.you@cornell.edu","You, Fengqi/B-5040-2011; Liu, Jay/A-9538-2013","You, Fengqi/0000-0001-9609-4299; Liu, Jay/0000-0003-4274-2355","Basic Science Research Program through the (NRF) - MIST of South Korea [2019R1A2C2084709, 2021R1A4A3025742]; National Sci- ence Foundation (NSF) [CBET-1643244]","Basic Science Research Program through the (NRF) - MIST of South Korea; National Sci- ence Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea)","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the (NRF) , funded by the MIST of South Korea (2019R1A2C2084709, 2021R1A4A3025742) , and by the National Sci- ence Foundation (NSF) under grant number CBET-1643244.","","54","1","1","2","2","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0959-6526","1879-1786","","J CLEAN PROD","J.

This framework is based on modeling the nonlinear behavior of the multiplicative error in order to improve forecast accuracy. The rapid growth of the cryptocurrency market, its high volatility and its applications in different commercial transactions have attracted the attention of academics and investors. Among cryptocurrencies, bitcoin is the one with the highest volume of trading. For this reason, it is important for investors and companies that use bitcoin as a means of payment to be able to predict its volatility more accurately. Nonetheless, this presents a great challenge given the chaotic behavior of the bitcoin volatility series. The results indicate that the proposed model is able to better capture non-linear behavior of the volatility time series, allowing a more accurate forecast in terms of MSE. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

There are several relay protocols proposed in previous research; these relay protocols are used to connect different types of blockchains. In this paper, we present a Secure Organizational Transactions Framework (SOTF) based on bridge chain to connect private chain or consortium with public chain which reduces interaction with public blockchain and saves the organization details privately in private chain or consortium. The proposed framework makes it possible for smart contract services to acquire means of payment in the consortium and private chain. Moreover, the proposed framework automates the process of updating the payment non-interactively. In this paper, we validate the communication between organizations blockchain and bitcoin, and find out the development cost of the proposed framework which ensures the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed framework.

In the Bitcoin system, miners provide computing power to confirm transactions in pursuit of transaction fees, while users compete by bidding transaction fees for faster confirmation. This process is in essence analogous to online ad auctions, where advertisers bid for more prominent ad slots. Therefore, inspired by ad auction research, we propose to apply the Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction mechanism in the dynamic confirmation game on Bitcoin transactions. Our model is targeted to deal with the problems caused by instability and low efficiency in the currently-adopted Generalized First Price (GFP) auction model in Bitcoin confirmation games. Besides, we use the rank-by-cost rule to replace the rank-by-fee rule, where each transaction's cost is calculated by the user-submitted fee and the waiting time. Aiming to probe users' equilibrium strategy, we first discuss the GSP game with complete information under synchronous submissions, and show that it has the Locally Envy-Free equilibrium. Then, we study the GSP game with incomplete information under asynchronous submissions, and define two types of strategies, i.e., the Farsighted Balanced (FB) strategy and the Instant Balanced (IB) strategy. The FB strategy is in line with users' practical needs of determining fees so as to maximize the long-term payoffs; however it cannot generate a stable equilibrium. Alternatively, the IB strategy focuses on the instant payoff maximization, and if all users follow the IB strategy, their equilibrium fees can finally converge to a stable profile. Finally, we design computational experiments to validate our theoretical models and analysis. Our research findings indicate that this novel GSP mechanism is superior to the currently adopted GFP mechanism. Besides, the convergence of the GSP game under the IB strategy has also been illustrated by the computational experiments.","[Li, Juanjuan; Ni, Xiaochun; Yuan, Yong; Wang, Fei-Yue] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, State Key Lab Management & Control Complex Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Li, Juanjuan; Ni, Xiaochun; Yuan, Yong; Wang, Fei-Yue] Qingdao Acad Intelligent Ind, Qingdao 266109, Peoples R China","","Yuan, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, State Key Lab Management & Control Complex Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.","juanjuan.li@ia.ac.cn; xiaochun.ni@ia.ac.cn; yong.yuan@ia.ac.cn; feiyue.wang@ia.ac.cn","","","National Key R&D Program of China [2018AAA0101401]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61533019, 71702182]","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The authors would like to acknowledge the funding supports from the National Key R&D Program of China (#2018AAA0101401) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (#61533019, #71702182).","","35","3","3","3","3","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA","1939-1374","","","IEEE T SERV COMPUT","IEEE Trans.

The results indicate that Bitcoin prices affect money supply and share dynamic inter-shock with CPI, EPU, and money supply. Specifically, the money supply and EPU negatively affect Bitcoin prices. CPI positively affects Bitcoin prices in the short-term, which supports the role of Bitcoin as a hedging asset. A bidirectional volatility transmission exists between Bitcoin prices and each of money supply, CPI, and EPU. Moreover, nonlinear causality test results show a bidirectional causality from Bitcoin price to money supply across all dimensions and a significant causality with CPI and EPU. The findings matter to investors seeking to refine their investment decisions while considering the effect of economic factors and to policymakers and central banks seeking to formulate policy tools using Bitcoin.","[Wang, Lei; Sarker, Provash Kumer] Wuhan Univ, Inst Dev Cent China, Villa 05, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Sarker, Provash Kumer] Cent Bank Bangladesh, Bangladesh Bank, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Bouri, Elie] Lebanese Amer Univ, Sch Business, Beirut, Lebanon","","Sarker, PK (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Inst Dev Cent China, Villa 05, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Sarker, PK (corresponding author), Cent Bank Bangladesh, Bangladesh Bank, Dhaka, Bangladesh.","leiwang@whu.edu.cn; provash.sarker@whu.edu.cn; elie.elbouri@lau.edu.lb","Sarker, Provash Kumer/AAC-7005-2022","Sarker, Provash Kumer/0000-0002-2767-7252","","","","","66","1","1","8","8","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0927-7099","1572-9974","","COMPUT ECON","Comput.

Bitcoin price prediction is a complex problem that needs advanced algorithms to solve exactly. In this paper, swarm based intelligence algorithms are applied in order to solve the bitcoin value prediction problem. In particular, Ant Colony Optimization and Binary Grasshopper Optimization algorithms are combined as a hybrid framework to select the most critical features in the dataset for bitcoin value prediction. The extracted features from the hybrid model are given as input to the convolutional neural network to predict the price of the bitcoins. As per the experimental results, the proposed hybrid algorithm produces better results when compared with the stand-alone version of grasshopper and neural network algorithms.","[Kumar, A.

At the time of this submission, behind-the-meter Bitcoin mining has gained significant traction; however, not a single environmental impact assessment has been conducted on this type of operation. This study seeks to fill the gap, applying the established Life Cycle Assessment methodology to estimate the environmental footprint of a single case study. Methods A life cycle assessment methodology of a natural gas power plant mining Bitcoin behind-the-meter in the state of New York following the ISO 14040 guidelines was applied. The functional unit (FU) is defined as the attributed generation capacity of 14 MW over the course of a regular full-calendar year in the attributional model. The FU is scaled to 22 MW and 104 MW in the predictive models to represent planned expansion. The TRACI 2.1 method was applied to characterize the environmental impact. The environmental impact categories considered in this study included global warming, acidification, smog formation, and particulate emissions. Results and discussion Located in New York State, Greenidge LLC, a natural gas power plant produces an estimated 88,440 metric tons of CO2-eq per year to mine Bitcoin behind-the-meter. Annual emissions would total 656,983 metric tons of CO2-eq if the plant devotes 100% of its generation to Bitcoin mining. The primary driver of greenhouse gas emissions is the generation of electricity itself, accounting for similar to 79% of the total emissions. At full capacity, annual emissions are comparable to the annual emissions of 140,000 passenger vehicles or the emissions resulting from the burning of 600 million lb of coal. Further, additional planned cases could produce an estimated 1.9 million tons tCO(2)-eq per annum. Conclusions Behind-the-meter Bitcoin mining makes the power plant a significant contributor to global warming at a time when New York State is attempting to radically reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 85% by 2050 and to have 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040. The environmental impact of this business model is not limited to individual sites but is spread out over upstream impacts as well. In combination, we see that behind-the-meter Bitcoin mining not only goes against local climate initiatives but also poses a significant danger to national initiatives due to feasible scalability, caused by an availability of existing infrastructure and favorable financials.","[Roeck, Martin; Drennen, Thomas] Hobart & William Smith Coll, Dept Econ, 300 Pulteney St, Geneva, NY 14456 USA","","Roeck, M (corresponding author), Hobart & William Smith Coll, Dept Econ, 300 Pulteney St, Geneva, NY 14456 USA.","martineroeck@gmail.com","","","","","","","64","0","0","7","7","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","0948-3349","1614-7502","","INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS","Int.

To keep costs low, miners are finding new ways to make their own electricity, often derived from fossil fuels. Mining companies are buying struggling coal, coal waste, and gas power plants and using the electricity they generate for their mining operations. Existing utility companies and power plants are pivoting to mining to make up for declining demand. Oil and gas companies are also buying mobile generators and installing them at well sites, mining right there at the oil or gas well, or selling the gas to third-party miners. The fossil fuel-to-bitcoin pipeline is getting shorter and shorter, and associated greenhouse gas emissions are climbing.","","","","JMcKenzie@thebulletin.org","","","","","","","23","0","0","1","1","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0096-3402","1938-3282","","B ATOM SCI","Bull.

Moreover, we find that bitcoin is less volatile than commodities such as oil and silver, US Treasuries, AAA-rated corporate bonds, EU carbon credits, and some of the most popular technology and media stocks, including Apple, Twitter, and Netflix. Equally important, we find that during the March 2020 stock market crash triggered by COVID-19, the volatility of bitcoin was lower than that of most of these asset classes.

State-dependence is also demonstrated, with Bitcoin prices exhibiting a greater increase when the corresponding USD7 minting event coincides with positive investor sentiment and is announced to the public by data service provider, Whale Alert, on Twitter.","[Saggu, Aman] Mahidol Univ Int Coll, Business Adm Div, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand","","Saggu, A (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ Int Coll, Business Adm Div, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.","asaggu26@gmail.com","","Saggu, Aman/0000-0003-2784-4353","","","","","25","0","0","0","0","ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE","SAN DIEGO","525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","1544-6123","1544-6131","","FINANC RES LETT","Financ.

Due to the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency, criminals commonly adopt cryptocurrency for trading drugs and deceiving people without revealing their identities. Despite its significance and severity, only few works have studied how cryptocurrency has been abused in the real world, and they only provide some limited measurement results. Thus, to provide a more in-depth understanding on the cryptocurrency abuse cases, we present a large-scale analysis on various Bitcoin abuse types using 200,507 realworld reports collected by victims from 214 countries. We scrutinize observable abuse trends, which are closely related to real-world incidents, to understand the causality of the abuses. Furthermore, we investigate the semantics of various cryptocurrency abuse types to show that several abuse types overlap in meaning and to provide valuable insight into the public dataset. In addition, we delve into abuse channels to identify which widely-known platforms can be maliciously deployed by abusers following the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Consequently, we demonstrate the polarization property of Bitcoin addresses practically utilized on transactions, and confirm the possible usage of public report data for providing clues to track cyber threats. We expect that this research on Bitcoin abuse can empirically reach victims more effectively than cybercrime, which is subject to professional investigation.","[Choi, Jinho; Seo, Minjae] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Daejeon, South Korea; [Kim, Jaehan; Song, Minkyoo; Kim, Hanna; Park, Nahyeon; Jin, Youngjin; Shin, Seungwon] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Elect Engn, Daejeon, South Korea","","Choi, J (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Daejeon, South Korea.","cyberz@kaist.ac.kr; rlawogks145@kaist.ac.kr; claude@kaist.ac.kr","","","Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT) [2021-0-00118]","Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT)","This work was supported by the Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2021-0-00118, Development of decentralized consensus composition technology for large-scale nodes).","","37","0","0","1","1","IEICE-INST ELECTRONICS INFORMATION COMMUNICATION ENGINEERS","TOKYO","KIKAI-SHINKO-KAIKAN BLDG, 3-5-8, SHIBA-KOEN, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-0011, JAPAN","1745-1361","","","IEICE T INF SYST","IEICE Trans.

Our in-sample analysis shows that the USDX, Gilt, Australian dollars, wheat, cocoa, cotton, sugar, copper, and lean hog can hedge Bitcoin, and the out-of-sample analysis reveals that the DAX, Dow-Jones, Nikkei, S&P 500, Brent, and WTI futures can be effective hedging instruments. We use a wavelet-based dynamic hedging model to account for heterogeneous investors in the Bitcoin market. For a short-term horizon, soybean futures reduce the variance in the in-sample hedged portfolio, and cotton futures offer the highest out-of-sample utility. Copper futures are the best for in-sample hedging in a long-term horizon, whereas live cattle futures have the best out-of-sample performance.

Although Blockchain technology prevents fraudulent behavior, it cannot detect fraud on its own. There are always unimaginable ways to commit fraud, and the need to use anomaly detection methods to identify abnormal and fraudulent behaviors has become a necessity. The main purpose of this study is to use the Blockchain technology of symmetry and asymmetry in computer and engineering science to present a new method for detecting anomalies in Bitcoin with more appropriate efficiency. In this study, a collective anomaly approach was used. Instead of detecting the anomaly of individual addresses and wallets, the anomaly of users was examined. In addition to using the collective anomaly detection method, the trimmed_Kmeans algorithm was used for clustering. The results of this study show the anomalies are more visible among users who had multiple wallets. The proposed method revealed 14 users who had committed fraud, including 26 addresses in 9 cases, whereas previous works detected a maximum of 7 addresses in 5 cases of fraud. The suggested approach, in addition to reducing the processing overhead for extracting features, detect more abnormal users and anomaly behavior.","[Shayegan, Mohammad Javad; Sabor, Hamid Reza] Univ Sci & Culture, Dept Comp Engn, Bahar St,Shahid Qamushi St, Tehran 1461968151, Iran; [Uddin, Mueen] Univ Brunei Darussalam, Sch Digital Sci, BE-1410 Gadong, Brunei; [Chen, Chin-Ling] Changchun Sci Tech Univ, Sch Informat Engn, Changchun 130600, Peoples R China; [Chen, Chin-Ling] Xiamen Univ Technol, Sch Comp & Informat Engn, Xiamen 361024, Peoples R China; [Chen, Chin-Ling] Chaoyang Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taichung 41349, Taiwan","","Shayegan, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Culture, Dept Comp Engn, Bahar St,Shahid Qamushi St, Tehran 1461968151, Iran.;Chen, CL (corresponding author), Changchun Sci Tech Univ, Sch Informat Engn, Changchun 130600, Peoples R China.;Chen, CL (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ Technol, Sch Comp & Informat Engn, Xiamen 361024, Peoples R China.;Chen, CL (corresponding author), Chaoyang Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taichung 41349, Taiwan.","shayegan@usc.ac.ir; e-mueen.uddin@ubd.edu.bn; mueen.uddin@ubd.edu.bn; clc@cyut.edu.tw","","Chen, Chin-Ling/0000-0002-4958-2043; Uddin, Dr. Mueen/0000-0003-1919-3407","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C.

This is motivated by prior evidence that bubbles are a key indicator of the economic cycle and contain important information on systemic risk. Using daily Bitcoin data from 2013 to 2021, the results provide strong evidence of a form of regime change in Bitcoin's VaR and ES.

ARDL model estimation establishes a long-run cointegration between GU, O, G, and Bitcoin. Moreover, GU and oil price exhibits a negative association with Bitcoin and positive influences running from gold price shock to Bitcoin in the long run. NARDL results ascertain the long-run asymmetric relations between GU, oil price, gold price (G), and Bitcoin return. Furthermore, GU's asymmetric effect and positive shock in gold price negatively linked to Bitcoin return in the long run, whereas asymmetric shock in oil price and negative shocks in gold price established a positive linkage with Bitcoin. The results of ARCH effects disclose the volatility persistence in the variables. The causality test reveals that the feedback hypothesis explains the causal effects between GU and Bitcoin and unidirectional causality running from Bitcoin to gold price and oil price to Bitcoin.","[Dai, Maoyu] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ Informat Engn Sch, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Qamruzzaman, Md.] United Int Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Hamadelneel Adow, Anass] Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Accounting, Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia","","Qamruzzaman, M (corresponding author), United Int Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dhaka, Bangladesh.","zaman_wut16@yahoo.com","","","","","","","76","0","0","3","3","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","2296-665X","","FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ","Front.

The price is very volatile, and it inherits the risk of quickly increasing to a peak and decreasing from the peak even faster. In this context, it is vital for investors to close their long positions optimally. In this study, we investigate the performance of the partially observable digital-drift model of Ekstrom and Lindberg and the corresponding optimal exit strategy on a Bitcoin trade. In order to estimate the unknown intensity of the random drift change time, we refer to Bitcoin halving events, which are considered as pivotal events that push the price up. The out-of-sample performance analysis of the model yields returns values ranging between 9% and 1153%. We conclude that the return of the initiated Bitcoin momentum trades heavily depends on the entry date: the earlier we entered, the higher the expected return at the optimal exit time suggested by the model. Overall, to the extent of our analysis, the model provides a supporting framework for exit decisions, but is by far not the ultimate tool to succeed in every trade.","[Eksi, Zehra; Schreitl, Daniel] WU Univ Econ & Business, Inst Stat & Math, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria","","Eksi, Z (corresponding author), WU Univ Econ & Business, Inst Stat & Math, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.","zehra.eksi@wu.ac.at; danielschreitl@gmail.com","","","","","","","15","1","1","0","14","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-7390","","MATHEMATICS-BASEL","Mathematics","JAN","2022","10","1","","","","","","","157","10.3390/math10010157","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math10010157","","","13","Mathematics","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Mathematics","YE8IC","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000741362100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Many attempts have been made to adjust and predict the fee volatility, but even well-formed transactions sometimes experience unexpected delays and evictions unless a substantial fee is offered. In this article, we propose a novel transaction inclusion model that describes the mechanisms and patterns governing miners decisions to include individual transactions in the Bitcoin system. Using this model we devise a Machine Learning (ML) approach to predict transaction inclusion. We evaluate our predictions method using historical observations of the Bitcoin network from a five month period that includes more than 30 million transactions and 120 million entries. We find that our ML model can predict fee volatility with an accuracy of up to 91%.

As robustness checks, the authors use autoregressive models to test the validity of the findings. Findings Using time series of daily data from 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2020, the results show that Bitcoin is not considered as a safe haven because it moves at the same pace as the S&P 500.

Our results suggest that the scaled principal component analysis (SPCA) approach steadily improves the predictive ability of the prevailing heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) benchmark model considering both the model confidence set (MCS) test and the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test based on three widely accepted loss functions. The forecasting performance is persistent to various robustness checks and extensions.

Here we explore the spatial distribution of Bitcoin mining through bottom-up tracking and geospatial statistics. We find that mining activity has been detected at more than 6000 geographical units across 139 countries and regions, which is in line with the distributed design of Bitcoin network. However, in terms of computing power, it has demonstrated a strong tendency of spatial concentration and association with energy production locations.

With this digital world, the money also changes its faces from paper money to digital currency called cryptocurrency without any central bank, which runs on top of the technology called blockchain. The trendiest cryptocurrency is bitcoin. Forecasting the daily price is a challenging task due to its nonlinearity. Most of the researchers tried to predict using various statistical and machine learning models which were not satisfactory because of its large dataset with more noise. The intention is to design a deep learning multiplicative long short-term memory model to estimate the price of bitcoin with an attention mechanism using technical indicators which gives better accuracy and a very less error rate. The proposed model is compared with some existing models, say long short-term memory, peephole, gated recurrent unit and multiplicative long short-term memory on the presence and absence of technical indicators. The comparative result shows that the proposed model outperforms the existing models in terms of mean square error, root mean square error and mean absolute error when evaluated with two benchmark datasets.","[Ahamed, S.

Steganography embeds the data that needs to be shared into digital carrier files and transmits it through open channels, which has important applications in protecting data sharing and realizing covert communication. However, the encrypted files generated by traditional steganography are susceptible to compression, cropping, geometric attacks, and man-made destruction in the process of open channel transmission, resulting in data loss, making it difficult for the receiver to correctly extract secret message. Currently, covert communication on blockchain can solve the above problems, but it also brings some new problems such as high computational complexity, low transmission efficiency, and nondetection resistance. Therefore, in this article, a covert communication method based on Bitcoin transactions is proposed. The proposed method first designs the index matrix of the transaction address. Then, the address interaction relationship that carries the secret message through the transaction index matrix is constructed. Finally, the address interaction relationship that carries the secret message is combined with the transaction amount to complete the covert transmission of the secret message on the blockchain environment. The proposed method improves the security and embedding efficiency of covert communication, reduces the number of transactions, and ensures the integrity of extracting secret message. A series of experimental results show that under the condition of ensuring the necessary security, the proposed method retains the strong robustness of the existing blockchain steganography and has strong resistance to detection.","[Luo, Xiangyang] Zhengzhou Inst Informat Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Math Engn & Adv Comp, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Luo, Xiangyang] Henan Prov Key Lab Cyberspace Situat Awareness, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Pei; Zhang, Mingliang; Li, Hao; Cheng, Qingfeng] Zhengzhou Inst Informat Sci & Technol, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Pei; Zhang, Mingliang; Li, Hao; Cheng, Qingfeng] State Key Lab Math Engn & Adv Comp, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China","","Zhang, P (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Inst Informat Sci & Technol, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China.","luoxy_ieu@sina.com; peizhang0810@163.com; zmlmail2021@163.com; li15575963101hao@163.com; qingfengc2008@sina.com","","zhang, pei/0000-0002-1590-7030","National Nature Science Foundation of China [U1804263, U1736214, 61872449]; Zhongyuan Science and Technology Innovation Leading Talent Project of China [214200510019]","National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhongyuan Science and Technology Innovation Leading Talent Project of China","This work was supported in part by the National Nature Science Foundation of China under Grant U1804263, Grant U1736214, and Grant 61872449 and in part by the Zhongyuan Science and Technology Innovation Leading Talent Project of China under Grant 214200510019.","","18","5","5","15","29","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","1551-3203","1941-0050","","IEEE T IND INFORM","IEEE Trans.

To this end, the Time-Varying Parameter Vector Autoregression (TVP-VAR) model, dynamic connectedness approaches, and network analyses are used. The results indicate that total spillover indices reached unprecedented levels during COVID-19 and have remained high since then. The evidence also confirms the high return and volatility spillovers across markets during the COVID-19 era. Regarding the return spillovers, Gold is the centre of the system and demonstrates the safe heaven properties. Bitcoin is a net transmitter of volatility spillovers to other markets, particularly during the COVID-19 period. Furthermore, the causality-in-variance Lagrange Multiplier (LM) and the Fourier LM tests' results confirm a unidirectional volatility transmission from Bitcoin to Gold, Stocks, Bonds, the VIX and Crude Oil. Interestingly the EPU is the only global factor that causes higher volatility in Bitcoin. Several potential implications of the results are also discussed.","[Elsayed, Ahmed H.] Zagazig Univ, Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, United Kingdom Dept Econ, Zagazig, Egypt; [Gozgor, Giray] Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Istanbul, Turkey; [Lau, Chi Keung Marco] Hang Seng Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","","Elsayed, AH (corresponding author), Zagazig Univ, Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, United Kingdom Dept Econ, Zagazig, Egypt.","ahmed.elsayed@durham.ac.uk; giray.gozgor@medeniyet.edu.tr; marcolau@hsu.edu.hk","","","","","","","59","7","7","20","20","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1057-5219","1873-8079","","INT REV FINANC ANAL","Int.

However, despite some studies on potential economic determinants of Bitcoin price, a consensus on the best predictors is not reached yet. This paper investigates different predictors from various markets including Gold, Oil, S&P500, VIX, USDI, Ether and Ripple as well as Bitcoin historical price in predicting one-step-ahead Bitcoin returns. We propose a two-stage forecasting that comprises discrete wavelet transform as the decomposition method and a deep long short-term memory network as the forecasting algorithm. Beside analyzing forecasting for both univariate and multivariate regression, we design a simulated trading system to put the forecasts into practice and analyze the economic profitability of the predictors. In addition, we shed light on the black box method by implementing sensitivity analysis. To investigate the predictors' efficacy through time and consider the effects of early 2018 price spike, the dataset is split into two periods: (1) prior to and including the spike and (2) after the spike. According to the experiments, it is hard to choose one predictor over the other in the first period. However, in the second period, Gold and Oil show the highest statistical accuracy, while S&P500 is the most profit-making predictor. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Usually, the complete history of Bitcoin blockchain data must be queried to acquire variables with economic meaning. This task has recently become increasingly difficult, as there are over 1.6 billion historical transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. It is thus important to query Bitcoin transaction data in a way that is more efficient and provides economic insights. We apply cohort analysis that interprets Bitcoin blockchain data using methods developed for population data in the social sciences. Specifically, we query and process the Bitcoin transaction input and output data within each daily cohort. This enables us to create datasets and visualizations for some key Bitcoin transaction indicators, including the daily lifespan distributions of spent transaction output (STXO) and the daily age distributions of the cumulative unspent transaction output (UTXO). We provide a computationally feasible approach for characterizing Bitcoin transactions that paves the way for future economic studies of Bitcoin.","[Liu, Yulin; Zhang, Luyao; Zhao, Yinhong] SciEcon CIC, London WC2H 9JQ, England; [Zhang, Luyao] Duke Kunshan Univ, Data Sci Res Ctr, Kunshan 215316, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Luyao] Duke Kunshan Univ, Social Sci Div, Kunshan 215316, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yinhong] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Liu, Yulin] Bochsler Finance, CH-6300 Zug, Switzerland","","Zhang, LY (corresponding author), SciEcon CIC, London WC2H 9JQ, England.;Zhang, LY (corresponding author), Duke Kunshan Univ, Data Sci Res Ctr, Kunshan 215316, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Zhang, LY (corresponding author), Duke Kunshan Univ, Social Sci Div, Kunshan 215316, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.","lz183@duke.edu","","","Duke Kunshan University","Duke Kunshan University","We have benefited from the comments by discussions at the SciEcon Research Accelerator Seminar.

There are many algorithms for price prediction for crypto currencies like LSTM and ARIMA. However, the downside is that LSTM-based RNNs are difficult to comprehend, and gaining intuition into their behavior is tough. In order to produce decent outcomes, rigorous hyperparameter adjustment is also essential. Furthermore, crypto currencies do not precisely adhere to past data, and patterns change fast, reducing the accuracy of predictions. Cryptocurrency price forecasting is difficult due to price volatility and dynamism. Because the data is dynamic and heavily influenced by various seasons, the ARIMA model is unable to handle seasonal data. In order to provide better price predictions for crypto traders, a new model is required. The objective of the study is to apply Fbprophet model as the key model because it is superior in functionality as compared to LSTM and ARIMA additionally removing the pitfalls generated in LSTM and ARIMA model while analyzing the cryptocurrency data. This study provides a methodology for predicting the future price of bitcoin that does not rely solely on past data due to seasonality in historical data. So, after fitting the seasonality and smoothing, the model is constructed that can be useful for real-world use cases. In case of crypto currencies where less historical data is available and it is hard to find pattern, proposed method can easily deal this type of problems. Overall difference between predicted and actual values is low as compared to other model even after seasonal data was available.","[Rathore, Rajat Kumar; Mishra, Deepti] GLBajaj Inst Technol & Management, Greater Noida, India; [Mehra, Pawan Singh] Delhi Technol Univ, Dept CSE, New Delhi, India; [Pal, Om] Minist Elect & Informat Technol, Govt India, Delhi, India; [Hashim, Ahmad Sobri] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Comp & Informat Sci Dept, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Shap'i, Azrulhizam] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, Ctr Artificial Intelligence Technol, Bangi 43600, Malaysia; [Ciano, T.] Univ Portsmouth, Fac Business & Law, United Kingdom Great Britain, Richmond Bldg,Portland St, Portsmouth, Hampshire, England; [Shutaywi, Meshal] King Abdulaziz Univ, Coll Sci & Arts, Dept Math, Rabigh, Saudi Arabia","","Mehra, PS (corresponding author), Delhi Technol Univ, Dept CSE, New Delhi, India.;Pal, O (corresponding author), Minist Elect & Informat Technol, Govt India, Delhi, India.","rajatatgio@gmail.com; itsdeepti.s@gmail.com; pawansinghmehra@gmail.com; ompal.cdac@gmail.com; sobri.hashim@utp.edu.my; azrulhizam@ukm.edu.my; mshutaywi@kau.edu.sa","Shutaywi, Meshal/AAI-3146-2020; Mehra, Pawan Singh/AAD-3979-2020","Shutaywi, Meshal/0000-0003-1454-2962; Mehra, Pawan Singh/0000-0001-8380-4749; Mishra, Deepti/0000-0001-5796-6728","","","","","17","1","1","13","13","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0306-4573","1873-5371","","INFORM PROCESS MANAG","Inf.

In recent years, as bitcoin's value continued to climb, the theft of electricity by bitcoin mining user began to appear. In order to solve the power theft problem of bitcoin mining users, we conducted an in-depth study on the power consumption behavior of such users based on the power data analysis technology. This paper analyzes the power consumption characteristics of bitcoin mining users and uses electric data acquire system to monitor power consumption behavior. The paper makes comparative analysis on the massive data such as voltage and power of the electric energy acquisition system, analyzes and calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between the electricity consumption of each customer and the line loss statistics of the power station by using Pearson correlation algorithm combined with the power loss of the power station, and analyzes the suspected users of stealing electric energy by taking an actual example. Through our research, we found a total of 16 bitcoin miners suspected of stealing electricity. After on-site investigation and evidence collection, we found that 10 of the users did have abnormal power consumption, and the accuracy rate reached 62.50%. Therefore, the economic benefits of this research are very significant. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

Yet the state-of-the-art is limited to predicting the price direction and not the magnitude of increase/decrease. In this paper, we seek to build on the state-of-the-art to not only predict the direction yet to also predict the magnitude of increase/decrease. We utilise not only sentiment extracted from tweets, but also the volume of tweets. We present results from experiments exploring the relation between sentiment and future price at different temporal granularities, with the goal of discovering the optimal time interval at which the sentiment expressed becomes a reliable indicator of price change. Two different neural network models are explored and evaluated, one based on recurrent nets and one based on convolutional networks. An additional model is presented to predict the magnitude of change, which is framed as a multi-class classification problem. It is shown that this model yields more reliable predictions when used alongside a price trend prediction model. The main research contribution from this paper is that we demonstrate that not only can price direction prediction be made but the magnitude in price change can be predicted with relative accuracy ( 63%).","[Critien, Jacques Vella; Ellul, Joshua] Univ Malta, Ctr DLT, MSD-2080 Msida, Malta; [Gatt, Albert] Univ Utrecht, Dept Informat & Comp Sci, Princetonpl 5, NL-3584 CC Utrecht, Netherlands","","Critien, JV (corresponding author), Univ Malta, Ctr DLT, MSD-2080 Msida, Malta.","jacques.vella-critien.18@um.edu.mt","","Ellul, Joshua/0000-0002-4796-5665","","","","","38","1","1","5","5","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","2199-4730","","FINANC INNOV","Financ.

At the second stage, Bayesian nonlinear expectations are introduced to incorporate model uncertainty or misspecification in prediction via specifying a family of alternative models. The Bayesian nonlinear expectations for prediction are constructed from closed-form Bayesian credible intervals evaluated using conjugate priors and residuals of the estimated approximating model. Using real Bitcoin data including some periods of Covid 19, applications of the proposed method to forecasting and risk evaluation of Bitcoin are discussed via three major parametric nonlinear time series models, namely the self-exciting threshold autoregressive model, the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model and the stochastic volatility model.","[Siu, Tak Kuen] Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Business Sch, Dept Actuarial Studies & Business Analyt, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia","","Siu, TK (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Business Sch, Dept Actuarial Studies & Business Analyt, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.","Ken.Siu@mq.edu.au","","Siu, Tak Kuen/0000-0003-2823-5138","Australian Research Council (ARC) [DP190102674]","Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council)","I would like to sincerely thank an Associate Editor and the reviewers for insightful and helpful comments.

Our one-minute and daily datasets cover 16 months before and 16 months during the Covid-19 pandemic (November 2018 to June 2021). Our IS, CS, MIS and impulse response results indicate a stronger bitcoin spot leadership, whereas our ILS results point to a weaker bitcoin futures dominance, during the Covid-19 pandemic. We construe this, as far as microstructure noise is concerned, as meaning that the bitcoin price is discovered in the spot market, and its dominance appears to have strengthened during the pandemic. However, as far as 'pure speed' is concerned, price discovery takes place in the bitcoin futures market, and its leadership seems to have weakened during the Covid-19 pandemic. The results of the time-varying measure (TVP-VAR) imply that, before the pandemic, price discovery took place within bitcoin futures but, during the pandemic, price discovery leadership has changed course, to occur within bitcoin spot.","[Mohamad, Azhar] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Finance, Kulliyyah Econ & Management Sci, Kuala Lumpur 53100, Malaysia; [Inani, Sarveshwar Kumar] OP Jindal Global Univ, Jindal Global Business Sch, Finance & Accounting Area, Delhi, India","","Mohamad, A (corresponding author), Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Finance, Kulliyyah Econ & Management Sci, Kuala Lumpur 53100, Malaysia.","dr@azharmohamad.asia","Mohamad, Azhar/D-8591-2017","Mohamad, Azhar/0000-0002-1075-598X; Inani, Sarveshwar Kumar/0000-0002-2946-5827","Kulliyyah of Economics and Management Sciences [DEBA22-011-0017]","Kulliyyah of Economics and Management Sciences","This work was supported by the Kulliyyah of Economics and Management Sciences [DEBA22-011-0017].

Our findings suggest that the overall dependence between assets and the currency market is the strongest in the short term, and Bitcoin is the least dependent across all investment horizons. The dynamic relationships between the four assets and the currency market vary with timescales.

In order to fill this gap, we analyse detrended correlations of the price returns, the average number of trades in time unit, and the traded volume based on high-frequency data representing two major cryptocurrencies: bitcoin and ether. We apply the multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis, which is considered the most reliable method for identifying nonlinear correlations in time series. We find that all the quantities considered in our study show an unambiguous multifractal structure from both the univariate (auto-correlation) and bivariate (cross-correlation) perspectives. We looked at the bitcoin-ether cross-correlations in simultaneously recorded signals, as well as in time-lagged signals, in which a time series for one of the cryptocurrencies is shifted with respect to the other. Such a shift suppresses the cross-correlations partially for short time scales, but does not remove them completely. We did not observe any qualitative asymmetry in the results for the two choices of a leading asset. The cross-correlations for the simultaneous and lagged time series became the same in magnitude for the sufficiently long scales.","[Watorek, Marcin; Drozdz, Stanislaw] Cracow Univ Technol, Fac Comp Sci & Telecommun, Ul Warszawska 24, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland; [Kwapien, Jaroslaw; Drozdz, Stanislaw] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Nucl Phys, Complex Syst Theory Dept, Radzikowskiego 152, PL-31342 Krakow, Poland","","Watorek, M; Drozdz, S (corresponding author), Cracow Univ Technol, Fac Comp Sci & Telecommun, Ul Warszawska 24, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland.;Drozdz, S (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Nucl Phys, Complex Syst Theory Dept, Radzikowskiego 152, PL-31342 Krakow, Poland.","marcin.watorek@pk.edu.pl; jaroslaw.kwapien@ifj.edu.pl; stanislaw.drozdz@ifj.edu.pl","Wątorek, Marcin/P-3112-2017; Kwapien, Jaroslaw/AAV-2842-2021; Drozdz, Stanislaw/V-7101-2018","Wątorek, Marcin/0000-0002-2131-7440; Kwapien, Jaroslaw/0000-0001-8813-9637; Drozdz, Stanislaw/0000-0003-1613-6175","","","","","60","0","0","1","1","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1999-5903","","FUTURE INTERNET","Future Internet","JUL","2022","14","7","","","","","","","215","10.3390/fi14070215","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi14070215","","","15","Computer Science, Information Systems","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Computer Science","3J0HF","","Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000833085600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, to date the literature has not yet found clear evidence of the dynamics of informational linkages between Bitcoin and the crude oil markets. This paper considers both static and time-varying information transmission of volatility, skewness and kurtosis, between two popular Bitcoin markets, Bitstamp and ItBit, and two major crude oil markets, WTI and Brent crude oil. A two-state regime-switching model is employed to estimate higher order moments and Legendre polynomials are applied to specify the time variations of spillovers. In addition, the latent impacts of the recent US-China trade war on spillovers are also explored. We conclude that crude oil is an information transmitter while Bitcoin is an information receiver in terms of the static and time-varying between-market transmission of three types of risk. The effect is affected by the occurrence of the trade war such that the information content of Bitcoin is enhanced once it begins. Moreover, Bitcoin is a diversifier for oil risk and this effect becomes more pronounced in the post-trade war period.","[Hou, Yang (Greg); Hu, Yang; Oxley, Les] Univ Waikato, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Div Management, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Li, Yujia] Univ Waikato, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, New Zealand","","Oxley, L (corresponding author), Univ Waikato, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Div Management, Hamilton, New Zealand.","loxley@waikato.ac.nz","","Hou, Yang/0000-0003-0017-9912; Hu, Yang/0000-0001-9277-8992","","","","","67","0","0","11","11","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1351-847X","1466-4364","","EUR J FINANC","Eur.

Using a varying-coefficient quantile approach, we find a safe haven role of Bitcoin, and it becomes gradually stronger when the pandemic intensifies. The relationship between gold and oil markets is shown to vary with changing severity of the pandemic. We find that gold acts as an increasingly weakened diversifier as the pandemic intensifies until a level, above which its diversification gains would dissipate then. In normal market conditions, both Bitcoin and gold perform as weak hedges for oil portfolios.

Despite the promising results provided by these studies, only few have considered the temporal information of this dataset, wherein the results were not very satisfactory. Moreover, there is very sparse existing literature that applies active learning to this type of blockchain dataset. In this paper, we develop a classification model that combines long-short-term memory with GCN-referred to as temporal-GCN-that classifies the illicit transactions of Elliptic data using its transaction's features only. Subsequently, we present an active learning framework applied to the large-scale Bitcoin transaction graph dataset, unlike previous studies on this dataset. Uncertainties for active learning are obtained using Monte-Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) and Monte-Carlo based adversarial attack (MC-AA) which are Bayesian approximations. Active learning frameworks with these methods are compared using various acquisition functions that appeared in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, MC-AA method is the first time to be examined in the context of active learning. Our main finding is that temporal-GCN model has attained significant success in comparison to the previous studies with the same experimental settings on the same dataset. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of the provided acquisition functions using MC-AA and MC-dropout and compare the result against the baseline random sampling model.","","","","ialarab@bournemouth.ac.uk; sprakoonwit@bournemouth.ac.uk","Alarab, Ismail/AAU-1011-2021","Alarab, Ismail/0000-0001-8320-6423","","","","","40","0","0","5","5","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1370-4621","1573-773X","","NEURAL PROCESS LETT","Neural Process.

Third, the linkages between return and trading volume are diversified. Both positive and negative tail dependence structures are observed, and the frequency of a positive tail dependence occurring is higher. Furthermore, the asymmetric tail dependence structure exists in positive and negative dependence situations. In the positive dependence structure, a co-movement in the increasing direction is stronger than a co-movement in the decreasing direction. In the negative dependence structure, a situation of a large return with low volume occurs more often than a situation of a small return with high volume.

Many countries have legalized or are considering legalizing a trading platform for this asset, and a set of companies worldwide accept it as a medium of exchange. As a result of this expansion, many studies in finance literature have focused on studying the efficiency of this cryptocurrency. In line with this literature, this paper investigates, using the abnormal returns and abnormal trading volumes methodologies, the dynamics of investors' reaction to the arrival of unexpected favorable and unfavorable information regarding the Bitcoin market in the context of the three famous hypotheses: the overreaction, the uncertain information, and the efficient market hypotheses. Overall, we find evidence confirming that the Bitcoin market tends to mature over time. More precisely, over the entire analyzed period, investors behave in accordance with the predictions of the uncertain information hypothesis when positive and negative events occur. However, splitting the timespan into sub-periods provides interesting insights. Remarkably in this respect is the fact that starting with the second sub-period, the response of investors in the Bitcoin market supports, in a moderate manner, the postulate of the efficient market hypothesis when favorable events are addressed. Moreover, our findings reveal that during the pandemic period, the efficiency of Bitcoin has increased, thus turning this stressful period into an advantage for this cryptocurrency. This improved market efficiency is also supported by the abnormal trading volume analysis.","[Diaconasu, Delia-Elena] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Inst Interdisciplinary Res, Dept Social Sci & Humanities, Iasi, Romania; [Mehdian, Seyed] Univ Michigan, Sch Management, Flint, MI 48503 USA; [Stoica, Ovidiu] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance Money & Publ Adm, Iasi, Romania","","Stoica, O (corresponding author), Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance Money & Publ Adm, Iasi, Romania.","ostoica@uaic.ro","Diaconasu, Delia-Elena/AEG-0886-2022; Stoica, Ovidiu/H-8419-2013","Diaconasu, Delia-Elena/0000-0002-9955-3873; Stoica, Ovidiu/0000-0003-2475-5750","Romanian Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, within Program 1 -Development of the national RD system, Subprogram1.2 -Institutional Performance -RDI excellence funding projects [11PFE/30.12.2021]","Romanian Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, within Program 1 -Development of the national RD system, Subprogram1.2 -Institutional Performance -RDI excellence funding projects","This study was funded by the Romanian Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, within Program 1 -Development of the national RD system, Subprogram1.2 -Institutional Performance -RDI excellence funding projects, Contract no.11PFE/30.12.2021.","","77","0","0","0","0","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","MAR 10","2022","17","3","","","","","","","e0264522","10.1371/journal.pone.0264522","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264522","","","18","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","2R2AR","35271593","Green Published, gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000820912700038","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Granger predictability based on the left tail, the right tail, and the center of the distribution show bidirectional predictability between spot and futures markets suggesting significant feedback effects following normal and extreme gains/losses where neither market dominates in price discovery.

Despite its strong protection for security and privacy, the current Bitcoin blockchain can only support a low number of transactions per second (TPS). Besides the PoW consensus protocol, the other key aspect of Bitcoin that limits TPS is its networking protocol. In this work, we aim at redesigning the current Bitcoin's networking protocol to increase TPS without changing the vital components in its consensus-building protocol. In particular, this work improves the compact-block relaying protocol to enable the propagation of blocks containing a massive number of transactions without inducing extra propagation latencies. The improvements of this work consist of (i) replacing the existing store-and-forward compact-block relaying scheme with a cut-through compact-block relaying scheme; (ii) exploiting rateless erasure codes for P2P networks to increase the block-propagation efficiency. Since the protocols designed in this work only need to rework the current Bitcoin's networking protocol and do not modify the data structures and cryptofunctional components, they can be seamlessly incorporated into the existing Bitcoin blockchain. To validate the designs, we perform analysis on the protocols and implement a Bitcoin network simulator on NS3 to run different block propagation protocols. Our analysis and experimental results confirm that the new block propagation protocols could increase the TPS of the Bitcoin blockchain by 100x without compromising security and consensus-building.","[Zhang, Lihao; Liew, Soung Chang] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Informat Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Taotao] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China","","Wang, TT (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.","zl018@ie.cuhk.edu.hk; ttwang@szu.edu.cn; soung@ie.cuhk.edu.hk","","Liew, Soung Chang/0000-0001-7055-6483","Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Province, China [2020A1515010708]","Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Province, China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province)","The work of T.

We select the Bitcoin closing price data from 2013 to 2021, and use GARCH (1,1)-GED to fit the volatility series. We confirm that Bitcoin price Fluctuation has nonlinear dynamics through BDS test, Hurst exponent, correlation dimension test and Lyapunov exponent. We find that the price fluctuation of cryptocurrency does not obey the random walk, and its fluctuation is positively correlated with time. Bullish information and bearish information have basically the same impact on cryptocurrency fluctuations. Cryptocurrency price fluctuations have cyclical trends and inherent long-term unpredictability, as well as certain fractal and chaos characteristics. ARCH effect and long memory characteristics of cryptocurrency return series show that cryptocurrency price fluctuations are Clustering and persistence.

There is no limit to the rate of output of transactions in the current blockchain. Since there is no limit to the transaction rate, the DDoS attacker can easily target blockchain by making a transaction. This DDoS attack was called 'Overflood Attack.' In this paper, to avoid 'Overflood Attack,' we propose a method to dynamically limit the maximum amount of the transaction to be created using the Least Mean Square. Blockchain is a p2p-based trusting technology that allows nodes participating in the p2p network to easily exchange data without a central management system. Since all nodes in the blockchain network share the same data at the same stage, confidentiality of shared data can be assured. Bitcoin and Ethereum are electronic money exchange platforms based on blockchain technology which make blockchain technology more popular. As a result, this technology has been used in a variety of fields concerning data confidence and honesty, rather than being used strictly for electronic money transactions. All the nodes in the block-chain network share the same info. To share the same data, Blockchain uses the p2p mechanism called 'flooding' as the data transfer process, where the data is represented as a transaction and a block. 'Flooding' means that the node that generated the data transmits the data to the directly connected node, does not transmit the data to all the nodes on entire network, and transmitted nodes return to connected nodes. Both blockchain nodes use 'Data Validation' and 'Memory pool management' to avoid undesired transmission rather than simply re-transmitting transactions and blocks. 'Data Validation' is the right transaction and block that is being transmitted.","[Akilandeswari, R.] A VeeriyaVandayar Mem Sri Pushpam Coll Autonomous, Thanjavur 613503, India; [Malathi, S.] Swami Dayananda Coll Arts & Sci, Tiruvarur Dt, Tamil Nadu, India","","Malathi, S (corresponding author), Swami Dayananda Coll Arts & Sci, Tiruvarur Dt, Tamil Nadu, India.","akil10dhakshana@gmail.com; visitmalathi@gmail.com","Malathi/ABJ-2998-2022","","","","","","17","0","0","1","1","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1938-7741","1938-775X","","J TRANSP SECUR","J.

It is hypothesized that the assets behave differently and thereby respond differently to inflation in different market conditions. Therefore, we employ the Markov Switching Vector Autoregressive to examine these assets' hedging ability against inflation in both stable and turbulent market regimes. Our main findings are threefold: We show that there exists a structural change and nonlinear relationship between the returns of hedging assets and inflation. Second, all assets can hedge against inflation more effectively in the short run than in the long run. We find that the inflation hedging ability of these assets are weak in the long run for both market regimes. We also find some evidence that the rigidity between the assets and inflation is relatively high in the stable regime. Third, according to the impulse response analysis, we also find that the responses of assets to inflation shock are heterogeneous across two market regimes.","[Phochanachan, Panisara] Univ Phayao, Sch Management & Informat Sci, Phayao 56000, Thailand; [Pirabun, Nootchanat; Yamaka, Woraphon] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Econ, Ctr Excellence Econometr, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Leurcharusmee, Supanika] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Econ, Ctr Human Resource & Publ Hlth Econ, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand","","Leurcharusmee, S (corresponding author), Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Econ, Ctr Human Resource & Publ Hlth Econ, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.","panisara_pho@hotmail.com; nootchanat_pi@cmu.ac.th; supanika.l@cmu.ac.th; woraphon.econ@gmail.com","","yamaka, woraphon/0000-0002-0787-1437; Leurcharusmee, Supanika/0000-0001-9349-000X","Center of Excellence in Econometrics, Faculty of Economics, Chiang Mai University; School of Business and Communication Arts, University of Phayao","Center of Excellence in Econometrics, Faculty of Economics, Chiang Mai University; School of Business and Communication Arts, University of Phayao","This paper is supported by the Center of Excellence in Econometrics, Faculty of Economics, Chiang Mai University and the School of Business and Communication Arts, University of Phayao.","","80","0","0","0","0","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2075-1680","","AXIOMS","Axioms","JUL","2022","11","7","","","","","","","339","10.3390/axioms11070339","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/axioms11070339","","","25","Mathematics, Applied","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Mathematics","3G5EC","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000831376700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Our empirical findings document that the connectedness between Bitcoin and stablecoin market volatility behaviors exhibits the presence of stable interconnection. This study is of particular importance since it is crucial for market participation in the ongoing crypto assets to be informed about both the volatility patterns of major cryptocurrencies and the relative volatility of Bitcoin against the stablecoin markets.

In particular, the number of messages needed to propagate a single transaction is very high which is rather wasteful in terms of bandwidth utilization. In this work we propose two simple modifications of Bitcoin software that allows a vast reduction of the number of messages needed for propagating a transaction over the network. The first modification consists of deferring the transaction announcements until a certain predefined number of new transactions is collected. The second modification consists of a new message format that allows several transactions to be sent within a single message. We show that the number of messages can be substantially reduced in this manner, at the expense of slight increase in transaction propagation delay. However, the latency of block propagation and of transaction acceptance is virtually unaffected by the proposed changes. Moreover, the tradeoff between the reduction of traffic and transaction delay can be minimized by judicious choice of the threshold number of deferred transactions.","[Misic, Vojislav B.; Misic, Jelena] Ryerson Univ, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada; [Chang, Xiaolin] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing Key Lab Secur & Privacy Intelligent Trans, Beijing, Peoples R China","","Misic, VB (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada.","vmisic@ryerson.ca","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","The work of V.

The main purpose of this study is to use a deep learning integration method (SDAE-B) to predict the price of bitcoin. This method combines two technologies: one is an advanced deep neural network model, which is called stacking denoising autoencoders (SDAE). The SDAE method is used to simulate the nonlinear complex relationship between the bitcoin price and its influencing factors. The other is a powerful integration method called bootstrap aggregation (Bagging), which generates multiple datasets for training a set of basic models (SDAES). In the empirical study, this study compares the price sequence of bitcoin and selects the block size, hash rate, mining difficulty, number of transactions, market capitalization, Baidu and Google search volume, gold price, dollar index, and relevant major events as exogenous variables uses SDAE-B method to compare the price of bitcoin for prediction and uses the traditional machine learning method LSSVM and BP to compare the price of bitcoin for prediction. The prediction results are as follows: the MAPE of the SDAE-B prediction price is 0.016, the RMSE is 131.643, and the DA is 0.817. Compared with the other two methods, it has higher accuracy and lower error, and can well track the randomness and nonlinear characteristics of bitcoin price.","[Zhang, Shengao] China Univ Geosci, Sch Publ Adm, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Li, Mengze] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Sch Publ Finance & Taxat, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China; [Yan, Chunxiao] China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China","","Yan, CX (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.","20191001331@cug.edu.cn; 1201820494@cug.edu.cn; yanchunxiao@cug.edu.cn","","","","","","","24","1","1","7","7","HINDAWI LTD","LONDON","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","1687-5265","1687-5273","","COMPUT INTEL NEUROSC","Comput.

Design/methodology/approach The dynamic contemporaneous nexus has been analyzed using spillover index developed and extended by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012, 2014) and Kyrtsou-Labys (2006) nonlinear causality tests. This study is implemented using the daily data spanning from January 2013 to December 2021. Findings First, using the spillover index, the authors find evidence that the S&P 500 was a net transmitter of volatility from oil and gold markets, but a net receiver of volatility from Bitcoin. Return spillovers from crude oil were transmitted first to gold, and Bitcoin markets and return spillovers from gold were transmitted to Bitcoin. Second, Kyrtsou-Labys nonlinear causality tests provide us further insights into the lead-lag interconnections among the four key considered variables from the economic perspective. Specifically, a close inspection of these empirical results, the integration of the four key assets is significant. Similarly, price fluctuation dependency among Bitcoin, stock, gold and oil markets is generally minimal, but it strengthens throughout the COVID-19 period. Originality/value This paper is the first study employing the spillover index Diebold-Yilmaz alongside with Kyrtsou-Labys nonlinear causality tests not only to capture the directional return spillover effects but also to highlight the potential presence of asymmetric causality relationships, nonlinear effects among assets under investigation that the previous studies have been ignored in these relations. Therefore, the main contribution of this article to the related literature in this field is significant.","[Ngo Thai Hung] Univ Finance Mkt, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","","Hung, NT (corresponding author), Univ Finance Mkt, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.","hung.nt@ufm.edu.vn","Hung, Ngo Thai/AAC-9394-2020","Hung, Ngo Thai/0000-0002-6976-1583","University of Finance-Marketing, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","University of Finance-Marketing, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","This research is funded by University of Finance-Marketing, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.","","58","2","2","8","10","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","0307-4358","1758-7743","","MANAG FINANC","Manag.

We use the 2017 bitcoin bubble to perform the primary analysis and date a potential crash just four days before the price peak. We detect the crash date a month before the Bitcoin prices reach their highest value. The bitcoin price fell 30% two weeks after reaching its maximum value.

With the assistance of statistical measures, the last two digits of BTC price were discovered to cluster at the numbers that end with '00'. In addition, the scales of BTC/JPY clustering at '00' tended to decline at the specific hour intervals.

To better understand this impact, academic researchers regularly apply well-established theories and methods. The vast majority of these approaches are based on multivariate methods that rely on average behavior and treat extreme cases as outliers. However, as recent history has shown, current developments in blockchain and cryptocurrencies are frequently characterized by aberrant behavior and unexpected events that shape individuals' perceptions, market behavior, and public policymaking. In this paper, I apply various scenario tools to identify such extreme scenarios and illustrate their underlying structure as bundles of interdependent factors. Using the case of Bitcoin, I illustrate that the identification of extreme positive and negative scenarios is complex and heavily depends on underlying economic assumptions. I present three scenarios in which Bitcoin is characterized as a financial savior, as a severe threat to economic stability, or as a substitute to overcome several shortcomings of the existing financial system. The research questions that can be derived from these scenarios bridge behavioral and design science research and provide a fertile ground for impactful future research.","[Treiblmaier, Horst] Modul Univ Vienna, Sch Int Management, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","","Treiblmaier, H (corresponding author), Modul Univ Vienna, Sch Int Management, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.","horst.treiblmaier@modul.ac.at","","Treiblmaier, Horst/0000-0002-0755-5223","","","","","62","2","2","0","0","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1999-5903","","FUTURE INTERNET","Future Internet","JUN","2022","14","6","","","","","","","162","10.3390/fi14060162","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi14060162","","","15","Computer Science, Information Systems","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Computer Science","2K5TZ","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000816399300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer technology works with no central authority or banks, and the transaction management and issuing of bitcoin is carried out collectively by the network. One major debate on bitcoin development and diffusion is the critical matter of nongovernment intervention through adequate policy and regulatory framework and thus hinders people's active participation (acceptance) in the bitcoin market. Consequently, this study is purposed to examine the role government policy and regulations (moderating impact) can have in driving the acceptance of bitcoin payment from the Chinese perspective. The UTAUT was used as the theoretical basis from which a model was developed for testing. The structural equation model (SEM) through the use of SmartPLS was employed to undertake the analysis. The results have demonstrated that government regulation moderates (significant) the influence of both performance expectancy and infrastructure support on the behavioral acceptance of bitcoin payment. However, government regulation contrary to expectations was not significant in moderating the influence of effort expectancy (EE) and security on the acceptance of bitcoin payments. Additionally, the study discovered that performance expectancy, security, EE, and infrastructure support were significant in encouraging bitcoin behavioral adoption. The practical and theoretical implications of these findings on the development and diffusion of bitcoin technology systems are dissected meticulously.","[Mensah, Isaac Kofi] Jiangxi Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Mwakapesa, Deborah Simon] Jiangxi Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Surveying Engn, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","","Mensah, IK (corresponding author), Jiangxi Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.","1185842364@qq.com","","Mensah, Isaac Kofi/0000-0003-2964-1736; Mwakapesa, Deborah/0000-0002-2402-4352","","","","","133","0","0","2","2","WILEY-HINDAWI","LONDON","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND","1939-0114","1939-0122","","SECUR COMMUN NETW","Secur.

With paradigm shift from social to technical factors, ransomware has also maintained the equal adaptiveness by shifting its focus from initial days' scareware and locker attacks to most recent crypto-ransomware threats. There is no silver bullet available to wipe out completely crypto-ransomware attacks for its obvious relationships between social engineering which investigates more infections with encrypted malware. Bitcoin, a means of digital payment demanded by Ransomware family needs characterization and analysis to predict the crypto-ransomware attack types. In this paper, at first, contractive autoencoder (CAE) is used on bitcoin transaction dataset for dimensionality reduction as a filter approach in order to obtain a reduced yet a powerful representation of the raw data and then the output of CAE is applied to the classifier for its improved performance and to make it a robust model. We use two classifiers for our experiments namely: Resilient KNN and Fuzzy Lattice Reasoning (FLR). The original KNN classifier was successful in dealing with homogenous data where the values of the numerical attribute exist completely but poses limitations while dealing with heterogeneous incomplete data containing mixed data (numeric and categorical) yet having missing values. Further, KNN used same K values for all the query objects that sometimes leads to misclassification. Resilient KNN is proposed in this paper to deal with these pitfalls effectively by assigning different k-values for different query objects, so as to obtain a most accurate predictive model. Next, the FLR is used for its ability to handle different types of data types and moreover, it is incremental and fast learning which tempted us to explore its possibility in detecting the crypto-ransomware attacks efficiently. The experimental results with several conventional and new evaluation metrics justifies the suitability of our proposed approach in building a robust and efficient classifier model to detect crypto ransomware families in comparison to existing research.","[Panda, Mrutyunjaya] Utkal Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Applicat, Vani Vihar, Bhubaneswar 751004, India; [Abraham, Ajith] Machine Intelligence Res Labs, Boston, MA USA","","Panda, M (corresponding author), Utkal Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Applicat, Vani Vihar, Bhubaneswar 751004, India.","mrutyunjaya74@gmail.com; abraham.ajith@gmail.com","","","","","","","46","0","0","0","0","DYNAMIC PUBLISHERS, INC","ATLANTA","PO BOX 48654, ATLANTA, GA 30362-0654 USA","1554-1010","1554-1029","","J INF ASSUR SECUR","J.

The model accuracy is checked by the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), while the model predictability is assessed by analysing a plot of the Verhulst model constructed upon the parameters provided by the GVM. The MAPE criterion suggests the reasonable accuracy of the overall GVM forecasting values and high accuracy by considering the last 400 forecasting values. Furthermore, the Verhulst model plot suggests that the GVM is potential on predictability as the plot is not chaotic. The GVM forecasting values suggest a slight future decline in transacting Bitcoin; this may be due to its competition with the other emerging cryptocurrencies.

We conclude with specific measures, based on this novel systems engineering approach, to effectively improve the resilience against intentional risk of the open SoS of public blockchains, composed of a non-inflationary money system, sound money, such as BTC, and of a world financial computer system, a financial conduit, such as ETH.

The bidding price of user transaction not only refers to historical transactions, but also considers the impact on future subsequences, and the result describes the interaction between transactions in detail. Also this paper proposes a method to express user satisfaction and establishes a user benefit model accordingly, so as to ensure the transaction is packaged successfully to the greatest extent within the acceptable range of transaction pricing. Finally this paper compares the proposed model with conventional machine learning prediction algorithms, finding that when user does not participate in the trading for the first time, the prediction effect of this proposal is better than that of machine learning over small data sets, moreover superior to machine learning methods in prediction accuracy and sensitivity, with a lower time complexity.","[Yan, Guanghui; Wang, Shan; Li, Shikui; Lu, Binwei] Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China","","Wang, S (corresponding author), Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.","0218649@stu.lzjtu.edu.cn","","","","","","","28","0","0","6","6","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1062-9408","1879-0860","","N AM J ECON FINANC","N.

We first employ a noise reduction approach based on the wavelet transform to smooth the fluctuations of the price data, which has been shown to increase the accuracy of subsequent predictions. Second, we apply a wavelet transform to diminish the influence of high-frequency noise components on prices. Third, in the price prediction model, we develop an optimized LSTM prediction model (LSPM-P) and train it using historical price data for gold and Bitcoin to make accurate predictions. As a consequence of our model, we have a high degree of accuracy when projecting future pricing.

The increase in NFT transactions has drawn the attention of the art market to the consequent carbon emissions resulting from verifying transactions in proof-ofwork blockchains supporting NFT transactions. With CO2-related deaths attributable to NFT transactions, social pressure from the art market has helped to progress the switch away from the deliberately polluting proof-ofwork blockchains to more sustainable consensus protocols.Nonetheless, many popular types of blockchain have resisted the pressure to decrease their environmental impact, including Bitcoin, whose attributed 2021 annual emissions will produce emissions responsible for around 19,000 future deaths. In response, recent global policy interventions have employed legal and fiscal tools to reduce the carbon impact of some or all types of blockchains. Linking the damage caused by proof-of-work blockchains to climate change and human mortality, this study examines the recent policy interventions designed to motivate a shift in blockchain consensus protocols and promote miners' energy efficiency to mitigate environmental damage.

In this paper, we aim to identify whether commonly recognized safe-haven assets, that is, bitcoin, gold, and commodities, can provide investors with effective hedging utility in international stock markets, especially during periods of extreme market turbulence. By using the spillover index method based on the TVP-VAR model, we find that firstly, bitcoin, gold, and commodities can only offer weak hedging effects on stock markets. Furthermore, their abilities to act as a safe haven are ranked as: commodities>gold>bitcoin. Secondly, in general, we have observed the increasing hedging ability of these safe-haven assets in times of extreme market turmoil. Thirdly, among international stock and safe-haven asset markets, the world and the developed stock markets act as the net spillover transmitters, while bitcoin, gold, and commodities are the net recipients. Lastly, the total spillover effects are time-varying and increase significantly after the outbreak of extreme events.","[Wang, Qian; Wei, Yu; Wang, Yao; Liu, Yuntong] Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Kunming 650221, Yunnan, Peoples R China","","Wei, Y (corresponding author), Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Kunming 650221, Yunnan, Peoples R China.","weiyusy@126.com","","qian, wang/0000-0001-9582-0818; Wang, Yao/0000-0002-0682-7215","","","","","32","0","0","2","2","HINDAWI LTD","LONDON","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","1026-0226","1607-887X","","DISCRETE DYN NAT SOC","Discrete Dyn.

Natural language processing was adopted in this study to model data-driven discourses in the crypto-economy, specifically the Bitcoin market. Using topic modelling, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a text analysis of cryptocurrency articles (N = 4218) published from 60 countries in international news media identified key topics associated with cryptocurrency in the international news media from 2018 to 2020. This study provides empirical evidence that across the corpora of international news articles, 18 key topics were framed around the following categorical macro discourses: crypto-related crime, financial governance, and economy and markets. Analysis shows that the identified discourses may have had a 'social signal' effect on movements in the crypto-financial markets, particularly on Bitcoin's price volatility. Results show these specific discourses proved to have a negative effect on Bitcoin's market price, within 24 h of when the crypto news articles were published. Further, the study found that in some cases, the source of the news may have amplified the volatility effect, particularly in terms of geographical region, relative to broader market conditions.","[Coulter, Kelly Ann] UCL, Sch Management, Level 38 & Level 50, One Canada Square, London E14 5AA, England","","Coulter, KA (corresponding author), UCL, Sch Management, Level 38 & Level 50, One Canada Square, London E14 5AA, England.","k.coulter@ucl.ac.uk","","Coulter, Kelly/0000-0003-3426-0962","","","","","52","0","0","7","7","ROYAL SOC","LONDON","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","2054-5703","","","ROY SOC OPEN SCI","R.

This paper establishes a portfolio optimization model consisting of a weighted unidirectional dual-layer LSTM model and an SMA-slope strategy. The weighted unidirectional dual-layer LSTM model is developed to predict the daily prices of gold/Bitcoin, which addresses the traditional problem of prediction lag. Based on the predicted prices and comparison of two representative investment strategies, simple moving average (SMA) and Bollinger bands (BB), this paper adopts a new investment strategy, SMA-slope strategy, which introduces the concept of k-slope to measure the daily ups and downs of gold/Bitcoin. As two typical financial products, gold and Bitcoin are opposite in terms of their characteristics, which may represent many existing financial products in investors' portfolios. With a principle of $1000, this paper conducts a five-year simulation of gold and Bitcoin trading from 11 September 2016 to 10 September 2021. To compensate for the SMA and BB that may miss buying and selling points, 4 different parameters' values in the k-slope are obtained through particle swarm optimization simulation. Also, the simulation results imply that the proposed portfolio optimization model contributes to helping investors make investment decisions with high profitability.","[Xue, Qianyi; Ling, Yuewei; Tian, Bingwei] Sichuan Univ, Inst Disaster Management & Reconstruct, Chengdu 610207, Peoples R China; [Xue, Qianyi] Sichuan Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Chengdu 610207, Peoples R China; [Ling, Yuewei] Sichuan Univ, Pittsburgh Inst, Chengdu 610207, Peoples R China; [Tian, Bingwei] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China","","Tian, BW (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Inst Disaster Management & Reconstruct, Chengdu 610207, Peoples R China.;Tian, BW (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.","bwtian@scu.edu.cn","Tian, Bingwei/D-1822-2010","Tian, Bingwei/0000-0001-9031-3307","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Science [XDA23090502]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Sichuan University)","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Science(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Sichuan University)","AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Science, (grant number: XDA23090502) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Sichuan University).","","42","0","0","2","2","HINDAWI LTD","LONDON","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","1687-5265","1687-5273","","COMPUT INTEL NEUROSC","Comput.

Quantitative study of FAW attack enables an in-depth understanding of the attack and then helps design countermeasures. The existing quantification studies of FAW attack only considered a perfect Bitcoin blockchain, where there is no block propagation delay. This paper aims to quantitatively investigate FAW attack in imperfect Bitcoin and Ethereum systems. We first establish an analytic model to capture the chain dynamics under FAW attack in a PoW system where the longest-chain protocol is used. Then the model is explored to derive closed-formed metric formulas for Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively. These closed-formed formulas enable the evaluation of both the profitability of FAW adversaries and the impact of FAW attack on system throughput. Experimental results reveal that FAW adversaries can get more revenue in the network with propagation delay than without delay. FAW attack can reduce the blockchain throughput, especially in Bitcoin.","[Zhu, Haoran; Chang, Xiaolin] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing Key Lab Secur & Privacy Intelligent Trans, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Misic, Jelena; Misic, Vojislav B.] Ryerson Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Yang, Runkai] JD Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China","","Chang, XL (corresponding author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing Key Lab Secur & Privacy Intelligent Trans, Beijing, Peoples R China.","21112051@bjtu.edu.cn; xlchang@bjtu.edu.cn; jmisic@ryerson.ca; vmisic@ryerson.ca; yangrunkai1@jd.com","","Zhu, Haoran/0000-0001-5630-9910","Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation [M22037]; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada","Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","We would like to thank the editors and anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

The purpose of this study is to consider that the difficulty to mine a block might be a better indicator of the Bitcoin\Ether's electricity consumption. Design/methodology/approach This study applies the vector error correction model to investigate data related to primary energy consumption and electricity production, supply and consumption for Bitcoin and Ether hashrates from 2016M1 to 2021M5. Findings The hashrate (difficulty of solving the cryptographic problem related to the validation of a transaction) is found to have a positive cointegration with energy and electricity consumption. Despite the launch of the Segregation Witness (SegWit) mechanism allowing blocks to handle a higher number of transactions per block, this Bitcoin and Ether growing need in electricity has significantly been increasing since October 2019. Originality/value The major contribution of this study is to investigate a more relevant indicator, namely, hashrate (computational difficulty to solve cryptographic enigma associated with cryptocurrencies-related transaction). The approach of this study can be justified by the fact that there exists a technical solution consisting in increasing the number of transactions per blocks so that less electricity might be required to validate a transaction.","[Schinckus, Christophe] Univ Fraser Valley, Sch Business, Abbotsford, BC, Canada; [Canh Phuc Nguyen] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Sch Publ Finance, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Chong, Felicia Hui Ling] Taylors Univ, Taylors Business Sch, Sch Accounting & Finance, Subang Jaya, Malaysia","","Schinckus, C (corresponding author), Univ Fraser Valley, Sch Business, Abbotsford, BC, Canada.","chris.schinckus@ufv.ca","Nguyen, Canh Phuc/AAG-8627-2019","Nguyen, Canh Phuc/0000-0001-8467-5010","University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","Canh Phuc Nguyen receives funding from the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.","","49","1","1","4","4","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1086-7376","1755-6791","","STUD ECON FINANC","Stud.

To achieve service-level differentiation among their users, many cryptocurrencies allow users to name your own price, giving rise to a large variation in fee offerings and hence, variation in confirmation times. Yet, the time it takes a cryptocurrency transaction to be confirmed in the blockchain is not only affected by the fee offered, but also by the contemporaneous congestion level and the inherent randomness in the verification process. Although it is generally expected that higher fees lead to quicker confirmation, the uniqueness of the cryptocurrency setting adds important nuances to the fee-speed relationship. Using Bitcoin-the original and most heavily used cryptocurrency by far-as our empirical context, we stylize the transaction confirmation processes, propose a theoretical framework that maps the causal path from fee to speed, and estimate this framework using Bitcoin transaction data under periods of high volatility. Our results show strong evidence for two characteristics of fee's impact: congestion dependence and tail shrinkage. Our finding that the speed acceleration effect of fee is particularly strong on the tail of the confirmation time distribution motivates a target service level approach to fee recommendation. To put this finding into practice, we develop an efficient computational procedure that helps Bitcoin users accurately estimate fees based on their confirmation delay preferences. We discuss the implications of our analyses on future cryptocurrency development and the long-term adoption of this revolutionary technology.","[Shang, Guangzhi; Ilk, Noyan] Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Business Analyt Informat Syst & Supply Chain, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Fan, Shaokun] Oregon State Univ, Coll Business, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","","Shang, GZ (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Business Analyt Informat Syst & Supply Chain, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.","gshang@business.fsu.edu","","","","","","","88","0","0","8","8","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0272-6963","1873-1317","","J OPER MANAG","J.

Our results reveal that the daily levels of positive and negative shocks in indices induced by pandemic news asymmetrically affect the Bearish and Bullish on Bitcoin and gold, and fear sentiment induced by coronavirus-related news plays a major role in driving the values of Bitcoin and gold more than other indices. We find that both commodities, Bitcoin and gold, can serve as a hedge against pandemic-related news.

The time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) is used to estimate the dynamics of connectedness in a daily dataset spanning the period November 11, 2013 to September 30, 2021. We find that the clean energy and traditional stock markets transmit shocks to Bitcoin and oil in terms of return, and they receive shocks in terms of volatility from Bitcoin and oil. Additionally, Bitcoin and other financial markets are only tenuously linked during non-crisis periods. Nonetheless, their connection strengthens substantially during times of crisis, such as the great cryptocurrency crash of 2018 and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.

In a representative use-case, a smart contract is executed when multiple parties fairly trade on a blockchain asset. On blockchain systems, a smart contract can be regarded as a system participant, responding to the information received, receiving and storing values, and sending information and values outwards. Also, a smart contract can temporarily keep assets, and always perform operations in accordance with prior rules. Many cryptocurrencies have implemented smart contracts. At POST2018, Atzei et al. give formulations of seven fair exchange protocols using smart contract on Bitcoin: oracle, escrow, intermediated payment, timed commitment, micropayment channels, fair lotteries, and contingent payment. However, they only give an informal discussion on security. In this paper, we verify the fairness of their seven protocols by using the formal verification tool ProVerif. As a result, we show that five protocols (the oracle, intermediated payment, timed commitment, micropayment channels and fair lotteries protocols) satisfy fairness, which were not proved formally. Also, we re-find known attacks to break fairness of two protocols (the escrow and contingent payment protocols). For the escrow protocol, we formalize the two-party scheme and the three-party scheme with an arbitrator, and show that the two-party scheme does not satisfy fairness as Atzei et al. showed. For the contingent payment protocol, we formalize the protocol with the non-interactive zero-knowledge proof (NIZK), and re-find the attack shown by Campanelli et al. at CCS 2017. Also, we show that a countermeasure with subversion NIZK against the attack works properly while it is not formally proved.","[Shi, Cheng; Yoneyama, Kazuki] Ibaraki Univ, Hitachi, Ibaraki 3168511, Japan","","Yoneyama, K (corresponding author), Ibaraki Univ, Hitachi, Ibaraki 3168511, Japan.","kazuki.yoneyama.sec@vc.ibaraki.ac.jp","","","","","","","32","0","0","4","4","IEICE-INST ELECTRONICS INFORMATION COMMUNICATION ENGINEERS","TOKYO","KIKAI-SHINKO-KAIKAN BLDG, 3-5-8, SHIBA-KOEN, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-0011, JAPAN","0916-8508","1745-1337","","IEICE T FUND ELECTR","IEICE Trans.

We find that both market and funding liquidity shocks forecast future volatility. More importantly, liquidity shocks have a stronger and persistent effect on the longterm trend component of volatility. Exploiting the predictability of liquidity shocks, we propose a risk-managed strategy to manage extremely high volatility and avoid occasional large crashes in cryptocurrency markets. This novel strategy virtually eliminates crashes and improves the Sharpe ratio substantially against the benchmark buy-and-hold strategy. The outperformance is much stronger during the turbulent periods of cryptocurrencies. Hence, this paper provides important insights into cryptocurrency investment and portfolio management combining traditional assets and cryptocurrencies.","[Tang, Tao] Jinan Univ, Inst Finance, Sch Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yanchen] SPDB Int Holdings Ltd, Res Dept, SPD Bank Tower, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","","Tang, T (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Inst Finance, Sch Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China.","taotang@jnu.edu.cn; yannson_wang@spdbi.com","Tang, Tao/H-8612-2015","Tang, Tao/0000-0003-4630-8900; WANG, Yanchen/0000-0002-2450-8867","Guangdong Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [GD18YYJ03]","Guangdong Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science","Funding Tao Tang thanks the support of the Guangdong Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [grant number GD18YYJ03] .","","41","1","1","6","6","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1042-444X","1873-1309","","J MULTINATL FINANC M","J.

In this study, we analyze the impact that the effective reproductive rate, an epidemiological indicator of the spread of COVID-19, has on both the price and trading volume of eight of the largest digital currencies-Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, and Binance. We hypothesize that as the rate of spread decreases, the trading price of the digital currency increases. Using Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity models, we find that the impact of the spread of COVID-19 on the price and trading volume of cryptocurrencies varies by currency and region.

The qualitative research approach is adopted for this research. The data is collected from several resources such as books, journal articles, reports, conferences papers, and websites. The data is analyzed through an explanatory research approach by providing scholars' opinions and their arguments on the subject matter. The findings of this study show that Shari'ah provides certain conditions to consider something as asset or currency from the Shari'ah perspective. In regard to cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), the Shari'ah rules vary based on the types of cryptocurrencies and whether cryptocurrency meets the conditions to be considered as currency or assets. Moreover, either cryptocurrency is an asset or currency, it should not contravene any Shari'ah laws, such as ribs (interest) and gharar (uncertainty). Since Shari'ah does not limit the currency to dirhams and dinars, Bitcoin can be considered as an alternative to the current currencies in a digital form. This would enable financial markets to move faster and secure transaction methods in the future. The policymakers might find this study beneficial to issue new guidelines and policy documents. The findings of the study might be interesting for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors to have a deeper understanding of cryptocurrency from the Shari'ah viewpoint.","[Rosele, Muhammad Ikhlas; Muneem, Abdul; Seman, Azizi Bin Che; Abdullah, Luqman Bin Haji; Rahman, Noor Naemah Binti Abdul; Sukor, Mohd Edil Bin Abd; Bin Ali, Abdul Karim] Univ Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","","Muneem, A (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Acad Islamic Studies, Dept Fiqh & Usul, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.","a.muneem@yahoo.com","ALI, ABDUL KARIM/AAX-7449-2021; RAHMAN, NOOR NAEMAH ABDUL/B-9279-2010; Muneem, Abdul/AAT-4223-2021; Rosele, Muhammad Ikhlas/A-2346-2017","ALI, ABDUL KARIM/0000-0001-5794-2996; RAHMAN, NOOR NAEMAH ABDUL/0000-0001-9954-2253; Muneem, Abdul/0000-0002-0182-8921; Rosele, Muhammad Ikhlas/0000-0001-9616-4445","Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme [FRGS/1/2020/SSI0/UM/02/19]","Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors greatly acknowledge the financial support received from the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (grant no.: FRGS/1/2020/SSI0/UM/02/19) entitled Model Zakat Aset Digital Berpandukan Kerangka Hukum Islam for the completion of the present work.","","89","0","0","8","8","SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","THOUSAND OAKS","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","2158-2440","","","SAGE OPEN","SAGE Open","APR","2022","12","2","","","","","","","","10.1177/21582440221102424","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440221102424","","","13","Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Social Sciences - Other Topics","2D7PP","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000811734300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, the fierce ups-and-downs that Bitcoins have experienced recently, coupled with the extreme volatility in the Bitcoin prices, have cast doubts on the eligibility of cryptocurrencies to be classified as assets. To investigate the characteristics of cryptocurrencies, this study compares Bitcoin, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, with other major investment assets. Our analysis focuses on the efficient market hypothesis measured by the Hurst exponent, together with long-term market equilibrium measured by Shannon entropy. The findings suggest that although the Bitcoin market is less efficient than other markets, it is not significantly different from the other markets in terms of its long-term market equilibrium. To elucidate these properties, we probe the Fokker-Planck and Schro & BULL;dinger equations and derive a probability density function, considering the speed of mean reversion and dispersion.","[Yi, Eojin] Northwestern Univ, Pritzker Sch Law, Evanston, IL USA; [Ahn, Kwangwon] Yonsei Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Choi, M.

In addition to prior explanations that generally attribute this phenomenon to domestic capital controls during normal periods, we provide another explanation that investors perceive cryptocurrency as an alternative (hedging) investment, especially under uncertainty. Using the emerging of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the subsequent lockdown policies implemented by a group of countries as natural experiments, we adopt a difference-in-difference framework to examine how the nexus affects Bitcoin price discrepancies. We find that price discrepancies are larger in countries with confirmed cases of COVID-19 and rigorously implementing lockdown policies. We then verify our alternative investment hypothesis on the mechanism by showing that countries with intensified exposure to media hype on COVID-19 topics and with more panic emotion among citizens during the pandemic generally experienced larger Bitcoin price discrepancies than their counterparts. We also find that domestic capital control, sanitary policy stringency, uncertainty aversion, individualistic culture, and governmental power could moderate the general effect.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

To reduce the required storage in a payment channel, eltoo introduces a new signature type for Bitcoin to enable payment versioning. This allows a channel party to revoke all stale payments by using a payment with a higher version number, reducing the complexity of storage from O(n) to O(1). However, eltoo lacks a penalization mechanism, which may incentivise profit-driven channel parties to close a payment channel with a stale payment state, to their own advantage. This paper introduces Daric, a payment channel for Bitcoin that simultaneously disincentivize profit-driven attackers and achieves optimal storage. In addition, to achieve higher efficiency and robustness, Daric does not rely on any particular properties of the underlying digital signature to prevent state duplication.","[Mirzaei, Arash] Monash Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","","Mirzaei, A (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.","arash.mirzaei@monash.edu","","","","","","","11","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-0260-6","","","","2022","","","","","","","51","52","","10.1109/DSN-S54099.2022.00029","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DSN-S54099.2022.00029","","","2","","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","","BT8HF","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000853335500020","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Second, this paper assesses the role of Bitcoin as a hedge or diversifier by determining the efficient frontier with and without including Bitcoin before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach - The authors examine the lead-lag relationship between COVID-19 and financial market returns compared to the financial stress index and between all markets returns using the thermal optimal path model. Moreover, the authors estimate the efficient frontier of the portfolio with and without Bitcoin using the Bayesian approach. Findings - Employing thermal optimal path model, the authors find that COVID-19 confirmed cases are leading returns prices of DJI, Bitcoin and crude oil, gold, copper and brent oil. Moreover, the authors find a strong lead-lag relationship between all financial market returns. By relying on the Bayesian approach, findings show when Bitcoin was included in the portfolio optimization before or during COVID-19 period; the Bayesian efficient frontier shifts to the left giving the investor a better risk return trade-off. Consequently, Bitcoin serves as a safe haven asset for the two sub-periods: pre-COVID-19 period and COVID-19 period. Practical implications - Based on the above research conclusions, investors can use the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases to predict financial market dynamics. Similarly, the work is helpful for decision-makers who search for portfolio diversification opportunities, especially during health crisis. In addition, the results support the fact that Bitcoin is a safe haven asset that should be combined with commodities and stocks for better performance in portfolio optimization and hedging before and during COVID-19 periods. Originality/value - This research thus adds value to the existing literature along four directions. First, the novelty of this study lies in the analysis of several financial markets (stock, cryptocurrencies and commodities)' response to different pandemics and epidemics events, financial crises and natural disasters (Correia et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020). Second, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that examine the lead-lag relationship between COVID-19 and financial markets compared to financial stress index by employing the Thermal Optimal Path method. Third, it is a first endeavor to analyze the lead-lag interplay between the financial markets within a thermal optimal path method that can provide useful insights for the spillover effect studies in all countries and regions around the world. To check the robustness of our findings, the authors have employed financial stress index compared to COVID-19 confirmed cases. Fourth, this study tests whether Bitcoin is a hedge or diversifier given this current pandemic situation using the Bayesian approach.","[Trichilli, Yousra; Abbes, Mouna Boujelbene] Univ Sfax, Fac Econ & Management Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia","","Trichilli, Y (corresponding author), Univ Sfax, Fac Econ & Management Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia.","yousratrichilli@yahoo.fr","","trichilli, yousra/0000-0002-7427-3584","","","","","62","1","1","5","5","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1450-2194","1758-888X","","EUROMED J BUS","EuroMed J.

Design/methodology/approach The authors test the presence of bubbles with the generalized supremum augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) test using critical values simulated by the bootstrap procedures of Gutierrez (2011), Harvey et al. (2016) and Pedersen and Schutte (2020). Also, the authors estimate Markov regime switching generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model for these cryptocurrencies. Findings The GSADF test result indicates the presence of bubbles for both cryptocurrencies. Simulating critical values by wild-bootstrap, which is robust to non-stationary volatility, leads to the highest number of bubbles in both cryptocurrencies. In addition, based on the estimates of conditional variance models with regime changes, the authors find that the bubbles identified are associated with a regime of low returns volatility, indicating a change in the trade-off between risk and return when the prices of cryptocurrencies differ from their fundamental values. Originality/value To the best of the authors knowledge, there are no studies that test the explosive behavior for cryptocurrencies by the GSADF test using the bootstrap method to simulate critical values from the procedures of Harvey et al. (2016) or Pedersen and Schutte (2020). These bootstrapping procedures are robust to heteroscedasticity and avoid the detection of false bubbles. Further, the advantage of Harvey et al.

Indeed, there has been a plethora of DL-based trading methods proposed in recent years. Despite the success of these methods, they typically rely on a very restricted set of information, usually employing only price-related information. As a result, they ignore sentiment-related information, which can have a profound impact and be a strong predictor of various assets, such as cryptocurencies. The contribution of this paper is multifold. First, we examine whether the use of sentiment information, as extracted by various online sources, including news articles, is beneficial when training DL agents for trading. Then, given the difficulty of training reliable sentiment extractors for financial applications, we evaluate the impact of using different DL models as sentiment extractors, as well as employ an unsupervised training pipeline for further improving their performance. Finally, we propose an effective multisource sentiment fusion approach that can improve the performance over the rest of the evaluated approaches. The conducted experiments have been performed using several different configurations and models, ranging from multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to provide a reliable evaluation of sentiment-aware DL-based trading strategies providing evidence that sentiment information might be a stronger predictor compared to the information provided by the actual price time series for Bitcoin.","[Passalis, Nikolaos; Avramelou, Loukia; Seficha, Solon; Tsantekidis, Avraam; Tefas, Anastasios] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Informat, AIIA Lab, Computat Intelligence & Deep Learning Grp, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Doropoulos, Stavros; Makris, Giorgos] DataScouting, Thessaloniki, Greece","","Passalis, N (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Informat, AIIA Lab, Computat Intelligence & Deep Learning Grp, Thessaloniki, Greece.","passalis@csd.auth.gr; avramelou@csd.auth.gr; sseficha@csd.auth.gr; avraamt@csd.auth.gr; doro@datascouting.com; gmakris@datascouting.com; tefas@csd.auth.gr","","","European Union; Greek national funds through the Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, under the call RESEARCH - CREATE - INNOVATE [T2EDK-02094]","European Union(European Commission); Greek national funds through the Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, under the call RESEARCH - CREATE - INNOVATE","This work has been co-financed by the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, under the call RESEARCH - CREATE - INNOVATE (project code: T2EDK-02094).","","38","0","0","2","2","SPRINGER LONDON LTD","LONDON","236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND","0941-0643","1433-3058","","NEURAL COMPUT APPL","Neural Comput.

Recently, the Bitcoin system is prevalent as a covert communication channel. The consensus mechanism requires participants to spread their found valid blocks under an adjustable difficulty, which provides a stable periodic broadcast channel. Moreover, senders and receivers are difficult to be traced, because the Bitcoin system is pseudonymous. However, since the historical data in the ledger cannot be removed from the Bitcoin system, the openness and the persistent storage of the ledger in the Bitcoin system post new challenges when designing data embedding schemes. More concreteness, most traditional data embedding schemes either design by heuristic or empirical algorithms or use a fixed field to embed data in the transactions. Therefore, the covert data can be recognized once the algorithm is leaked or the pattern is explored. In this article, we first propose a hash chain-based covert data embedding (HC-CDE) scheme.

For this purpose, a nationally representative survey data set of 3,864 German citizens is used, of which 354 (9.2%) reported owning cryptocurrencies in March 2019. We analyze the subpopulation of 225 cryptocurrency owners who classify as investors. 56% of them experienced positive returns, while 29% had negative results. The remaining respondents broke even. The average investment was (sic)1,773 in a portfolio of two cryptocurrencies. At the time of the survey, the average portfolio value had risen to (sic)7094 - an average gain of 300%. While nearly half of the investors (44%) outperformed Bitcoin market returns, not a single one of the early investors (2009-2012) did.

We also document that gold exhibits a strong resilience during COVID-19 crisis, suggesting its potential hedging ability during uncertainty.

In particular, this study provides insights into what can drive Islamic cryptocurrency markets and how do they react during the COVID-19 pandemic. We explore the cryptocurrency volatility and the connectedness between the Islamic, conventional, and COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths using the wavelet approaches. The preliminary results show that faith-based cryptocurrencies have reduced risk exposure than their conventional counterparts, in the long run, making them more appealing for investment, particularly for investors seeking low-risk and Shariah-compliant assets. Furthermore, the empirical results indicate that both Islamic and conventional cryptocurrencies are more sensitive to the death toll than the newly confirmed cases. We also observe significant positive co-movements between Bitcoin and Islamic cryptocurrencies. Besides, Bitcoin exhibits a substantial response during various time scales while compared with Islamic cryptocurrencies. This study contributes to the literature by investigating the sensitivity and the vulnerability of a new category of cryptocurrencies backed by tangible assets to pandemic shocks. To the extent of the author's knowledge, this study is the first attempt that examines the co-movement between Islamic and conventional cryptocurrencies using the wavelet approach. A viable, ethical, and alternative investment route for faith-based investors can be provided by the Shariah-Compliant cryptocurrencies as they are risk-reduced and less sensitive to the pandemic than conventional benchmarks.

This pro-cess is vulnerable to different types of attacks. One of the most famous attacks in this cat-egory is selfish mining. This attack is essentially a strategy that a sufficiently powerful mining pool can follow to obtain more revenue than its fair share. The reason that selfish mining is effective is the difficulty adjustment algorithm used in the Bitcoin network. In this paper, we analyze the profitability of selfish mining with respect to time and propose an alternative difficulty adjustment algorithm that discourages selfish mining while allow-ing the Bitcoin network to remain scalable. We analyze our proposed solution, present the results, and discuss its effectiveness. Based on our analysis, our proposed algorithm effec-tively increases the profitability waiting time for the attackers to almost double its original value. For example, for a miner with 40% of the network's hash power, the algorithm extends the waiting time from 4 weeks to more than 11 weeks. This will discourage attack-ers from performing their malicious activities. We also show that our proposed algorithm allows the network to scale while it increases the waiting time.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Using a partial wavelet coherence framework to capture the bivariate co-movement, our findings show strong (weak) positive co-movements among GB (sustainable cryptocurrencies) and DJSWI returns, where GBs (sustainable cryptocurrencies) have a heterogeneous leading role in the short-term and long-term horizons. Results indicate moderate positive (negative) co-movement among GBs and sustainable cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin) and DJSWI in the short run (long run). Overall, the results show GB (sustainable cryptocurrencies) acts as a diversifier for Bitcoin and sustainable cryptocurrencies in most cases (DJSWI). However, increasing Bitcoin returns adversely impacts the DJSWI in the long run. Findings are equally imperative for green investors, crypto traders and policymakers, where investors and traders can earn financial and social returns, and policy-makers can deploy suitable policies for the development of sustainable cryptocurrency mining processes.

Besides, the possible effect of BTC and other cryptocurrencies on either financial markets or transactions has been widely discussed. However, the environmental effects of cryptocurrency demand have been ignored. Here, this study examines the nexus between cryptocurrencies and environmental degradation by employing standard and asymmetric causality methods. The Toda-Yamamoto and bootstrap-augmented Toda-Yamamoto test results reveal Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) excluding Ripple (XRP) have causal effects on environmental degradation. The Fourier-augmented Toda-Yamamoto test results show causal effects running from Bitcoin and Ripple to environmental degradation, whereas no causal effect runs from Ethereum to environmental degradation. The asymmetric causality shows causal effects from the positive shock of Bitcoin demand, negative shocks of Ripple and Ethereum demands to positive shocks of environmental degradation.

We begin by addressing the concept of financial innovation as a social phenomenon embedded in networks of users, technologists, regulations, institutions, culture and history. Secondly, we examine the disruptive and evolutionary nature of the Bitcoin, comparing it with the characteristics of legal tender money.

We uncover a structural change in the connectedness evolving in 2020 as the market restructures in reaction to the unprecedented monetary injections as a counter to the COVID-19-induced economic standstill.

Our method holds that stock markets are integrated if there is a significant flow of information between exchanges. The results reveal a statistically insignificant flow of information among African stock exchanges, and for the few cases in which information flow is statistically significant, the magnitudes are low.

In addition, non-linear, non-parametric measures such as the Generalised Measure of Correlation (GMC) and non-parametric copula estimates are applied. The results across this range of measures are consistent. The metrics suggest that, whilst the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic does not appear to have increased the correlations between the cryptocurrency series, it appears to have increased the correlations between the returns on cryptocurrencies and those on the S&P500 Index. This suggests that investments in cryptocurrencies are not likely to offer key diversification strategies in times of crisis, on the basis of evidence provided by this crisis.","[Allen, David E.] Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia; [Allen, David E.] Asia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 413305, Taiwan; [Allen, David E.] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Joondalup, WA 6027, Australia","","Allen, DE (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia.;Allen, DE (corresponding author), Asia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 413305, Taiwan.;Allen, DE (corresponding author), Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Joondalup, WA 6027, Australia.","profallen2007@gmail.com","","Allen, David/0000-0001-7782-0865","","","","","59","2","2","4","4","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

But such institutional analysis needs to be complemented by polycentric analysis of how blockchains change. We characterize such change as resulting from internal sources and external sources. Internal sources include constitutional (protocol) design and collective-choice processes for updating protocols, which help coordinate network participants and users. External sources include competitive pressure from other cryptocurrency networks. By studying two leading networks, Bitcoin and Ethereum, we illustrate how conceptualizing blockchains as competing and constitutional polycentric enterprises clarifies their processes of change.","[Alston, Eric] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Law, Wilson] Baylor Univ, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Murtazashvili, Ilia; Weiss, Martin] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","","Murtazashvili, I (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.","ilia.murtazashvili@pitt.edu","Weiss, Martin/G-5177-2015","Weiss, Martin/0000-0001-6785-0913; Law, Wilson/0000-0001-9408-7001; Murtazashvili, Ilia/0000-0001-9096-9488","Center for Governance and Markets at the University of Pittsburgh; Charles Koch Foundation","Center for Governance and Markets at the University of Pittsburgh; Charles Koch Foundation","Eric Alston gratefully acknowledges the research assistance of Tucker Arendsee, Kai Suematsu, and Lindsay Vanlerberg.

Moreover, BlockQuery does not use third party servers as data providers and operates on a local copy of the blockchain to prevent information disclosure. Compared to other Bitcoin query tools, BlockQuery was designed from a forensic standpoint and meets all four of the defined querying criteria of being open source, confidential, automatically converting key representations, and allowing the manual adjustment of derivation depth.","[Thomas, Tyler; Edwards, Tiffanie; Baggili, Ibrahim] Newhaven Univ, West Haven, CT 06516 USA","","Thomas, T (corresponding author), Newhaven Univ, West Haven, CT 06516 USA.","thom10@unh.newhaven.edu; tedwa4@unh.newhaven.edu; baggili@gmail.com","","","National Science Foundation [1921813]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Number 1921813 Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.","","16","0","0","1","1","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","","2666-2817","","FORENS SCI INT-DIGIT","Forens.

These systems compromise the privacy of the users in such a way that their personal data are collected and controlled by the third-parties. In this regard, Bitcoin has been implemented in the financial space. It has made possible the trusted and auditable computing via decentralized network associated with a public ledger. This work proposes a decentralized personal data management system for banking sector using block chain which makes sure that the user can control their personal data in their own .It presents a Privacy-Protected Blockchain network in which all data is encoded within a controlled time period. Despite the fact that the data is available in the past, this design can successfully preserve user privacy and protect from deceivers, providing the data more stable and healthier. Blockchain has its advantages over features such as transparency, decentralization and immutability. In the proposed model, a protocol is implemented which converts the blockchain into automated access control manager. There is no need for a third party to be trusted for the implementation of this model. In the proposed system, the transactions are not limited to financial transactions like Bitcoin, it also includes data storing, sharing and querying. Hence, the use of blockchain could reduce the overly concern about securing and compartmentalizing the data.","[Zainal, Dr. M.

To fight the illegal drug trade, it is necessary to understand the factors influencing choices made by DNM consumers. ClearNet forums facilitate interactions among new and experienced DarkNet users, thus serving as an ideal source for investigation and research. The methodology of temporal topic models and sentiment analysis were applied to the ClearNet forum data to explore DNM new drug users' behavior over time. We inspected the development of major topics from the forum over eight years (2012e19) period to study the evolution in motivations and challenges faced by DNM users. The extracted temporal topic models successfully captured the apparent dynamics of critical events in the crypto world, showing the shift from Bitcoin to Monero. Our analysis demonstrates that the Bitcoin traceability announcement (made public in 2015) did not have a deterrent effect on the usage of Bitcoin, and this declaration instead acted as an advertisement for DNMs. Drug buyers used Bitcoin despite its traceability until Monero became untraceable in 2017 due to its privacy update.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Decentralized Business Review, p. 21260, 2008). In the earlier days, even though proof-of-work (PoW) consensus had performance-related issues, it was not considered as a major issue. The transaction processing mechanism is 3.3 to seven transactions per second with smallest 200-250 byte transactions. While this was sufficient at the beginning, the system has been overloaded over the years resulting in low transaction speed and outrageous transaction cost. Massive growth in cryptocurrency results in scalability issues in the blockchain. With more companies trying to shift their existing system to blockchain, it would be difficult to tackle with the existing PoW consensus caused by its scalability issues (Xie et al. in IEEE Network 33:166-173, 2019). The purpose of this research is to fix the scalability issues and increases the transaction speed by applying techniques such as lightning network, plasma cash, and hard/soft forks.","[Poojaa, K.

However, an alternative solution like Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus protocol has been proposed to use instead of the Proof-of-Work algorithm for mining cryptocurrencies which is capable to reduce the significant amount of energy consumption. Not only that, but the use of renewable energy can also be an alternate option to use the Proof-of-Work algorithm for mining cryptocurrencies which is environment friendly. This paper aims to highlight blockchain technology, the energy consumption and impact on the environment, energy reducing method by using PoS consensus protocol instead of using the PoW algorithm, and discussion with some recommendations.","[Islam, Md Rafiqul; Rashid, Muhammad Mahbubur; Bin Embong, Abd Halim] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Mechatron Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Rahman, Mohammed Ataur] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Mech Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Bin Mohamad, Muslim Har Sani] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Accounting, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","","Islam, MR; Rashid, MM (corresponding author), Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Mechatron Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.","","","","","","","","80","1","1","4","4","SCIENCE & INFORMATION SAI ORGANIZATION LTD","WEST YORKSHIRE","19 BOLLING RD, BRADFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE, 00000, ENGLAND","2158-107X","2156-5570","","INT J ADV COMPUT SC","Int.

In several countries, this has led to a significant change in the way payments are made, leading to new forms of payment, such as crypto-currencies. With regard to cryptocurrencies, it remains a complex issue involving especially volatility, but also money laundering and consumer protection issues. While most countries consider cryptocurrencies too volatile to be used as a payment alternative, crypto-currencies gain interest of investors in the last 10 years due to the possibility of obtaining large profits. The aim of the paper is to study the volatility of the first 5 cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Cardano and Ripple) through GARCH models. The process of evaluating highly volatile cryptocurrencies is complex and depends on many parameters. Therefore, our results would be particularly useful in terms of portfolio and risk management and could help them to be more agile in evaluating their investments, in making optimal decisions and making future forecasts. We find that the GARCH (1.1) models provide the best fit, in terms of modelling of the volatility in the most popular and largest cryptocurrencies. The results show that for BTC, ETH and XRP the appropriate model is GARCH (1.1) and in the case of BNC and CARDANO GARCH-M explain better the volatility of the crypto-currencies. Therefore, more in depth analysis of the datasets may be required to confirm or deny possible structural change. The study can be complemented by carrying out an event study on the 5 cryptocurrencies analyzed or extending the analysis by applying other GARCH models, to research the optimal model for several cryptocurrencies.","[MICU, raluca; DUMITRESCU, Dalina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania","","DUMITRESCU, D (corresponding author), Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.","raluca.micu@bnro.ro; dalina.dumitrescu@fin.ase.ro","","","","","","","18","0","0","0","0","SCIENDO","WARSAW","BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND","2502-0226","2558-9652","","P INT CONF BUS EXCEL","Proc.

Using high-frequency price data on Bitcoin from March 3, 2013, to May 31, 2020, it shows that the patterns of intraday return predictability change in the presence of large intraday price jumps, FOMC announcement release, liquidity levels, and the outbreak of the COVID-19. Intraday return predictability is also found in other actively traded cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple. Further analysis shows that the timing strategy based on the intraday predictors produces higher economic value than the benchmark strategy such as the always-long or the buy-and-hold. Evidence of intraday momentum can be explained in light of the theory of late-informed investors, whereas evidence of intraday reversal, which is unique to the cryptocurrency market, can be related to investors' overreaction to non-fundamental information and overconfidence bias.","[Wen, Zhuzhu] Tsinghua Univ, PBC Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Bouri, Elie] Lebanese Amer Univ, Sch Business, Beirut, Lebanon; [Xu, Yahua] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yang] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Chinese Acad Finance & Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yahua] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Econ & Management Acad, 39 South Coll Rd, Haidian Dist, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","","Xu, YH (corresponding author), Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Econ & Management Acad, 39 South Coll Rd, Haidian Dist, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.","yahua.xu@cufe.edu.cn","","Zhao, Yang/0000-0002-7833-1657","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71801117, 71973162]; Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics [20190092]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics","Acknowledgments Yang Zhao specially acknowledges the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71801117, 71973162) and Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics (Grant No. 20190092) .

Since their initiation, the prices seem highly volatile and came to their amazing cutoff points during the COVID-19 pandemic. This factor makes them a popular choice for investors with an aim to get higher returns over a short span of time. The colossal high points and low points in digital forms of money costs have drawn in analysts from the scholarly community as well as ventures to foresee their costs. A few machines and deep learning algorithms like gated recurrent unit (GRU), long short-term memory (LSTM), autoregressive integrated moving average with explanatory variable (ARIMAX), and a lot more have been utilized to exactly predict and investigate the elements influencing cryptocurrency prices. The current literature is totally centered around the forecast of digital money costs disregarding its reliance on other cryptographic forms of money. However, Dash coin is an individual cryptocurrency, but it is derived from Bitcoin and Litecoin. The change in Bitcoin and Litecoin prices affects the Dash coin price. Motivated from these, we present a cryptocurrency price prediction framework in this paper. It acknowledges different cryptographic forms of money (which are subject to one another) as information and yields higher accuracy. To illustrate this concept, we have considered a price prediction of Dash coin through the past days' prices of Dash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin as they have hierarchical dependency among them at the protocol level. We can portray the outcomes that the proposed scheme predicts the prices with low misfortune and high precision. The model can be applied to different digital money cost expectations.","[Patel, Nisarg P.; Parekh, Raj; Thakkar, Nihar; Gupta, Rajesh; Tanwar, Sudeep] Nirma Univ, Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Ahmadabad 382481, Gujarat, India; [Sharma, Gulshan] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Elect Engn Technol, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Davidson, Innocent E.] Durban Univ Technol, Dept Elect Power Engn, Steve Biko Campus, ZA-4001 Durban, South Africa; [Sharma, Ravi] Univ Petr & Energy Studies, Ctr Inter Disciplinary Res & Innovat, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India","","Tanwar, S (corresponding author), Nirma Univ, Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Ahmadabad 382481, Gujarat, India.;Davidson, IE (corresponding author), Durban Univ Technol, Dept Elect Power Engn, Steve Biko Campus, ZA-4001 Durban, South Africa.","sudeep.tanwar@nirmauni.ac.in; innocentD@dut.ac.za","Tanwar, Sudeep/AAI-6709-2020","Tanwar, Sudeep/0000-0002-1776-4651; THAKKAR, NIHAR/0000-0001-9846-5735; PAREKH, RAJ/0000-0001-9524-8516; Gupta, Rajesh/0000-0003-3298-4238; Davidson, Innocent/0000-0002-2336-4136; Patel, Nisarg/0000-0001-5964-4204","","","","","114","0","0","3","3","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","34511","34538","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3163023","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3163023","","","28","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","0H6YK","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000778878600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Next, the article focuses on the period after 2020, and applies the event study methodology in order to establish, how the two cryptocurrencies with the highest market capitalization (Bitcoin and Ethereum) reacted to selected events. These events mainly encompassed hacker attacks aimed at the systems that form the basis of the operation of cryptocurrencies, and also certain steps regarding their regulation and application. Overall, it was established that hacker attacks did not have a significant effect on the exchange rates of the two examined cryptocurrencies.

To derive more informative ideas, we split the whole quantile interval to several sub-intervals and find asymmetric behaviour of the market efficiency across the lower and upper sub-intervals in several cryptocurrency markets.

We identify significant bidirectional causalities between trading volume and returns at different high-frequency intervals; however, those linkages are weakening with decreasing data frequencies. The findings confirm the leading position of the Bitcoin trading volume in the cryptocurrency price formation. This evidence will help investors to design effective trading strategies in cryptocurrency markets providing useful insights from cryptocurrency categorisation.","[Yarovaya, Larisa] Southampton Business Sch, Ctr Digital Finance, Southampton, Hants, England; [Zieba, Damian] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland","","Yarovaya, L (corresponding author), Southampton Business Sch, Ctr Digital Finance, Southampton, Hants, England.","l.yarovaya@soton.ac.uk","","Zieba, Damian/0000-0002-5968-2590; Yarovaya, Larisa/0000-0002-9638-2917","","","","","35","0","0","12","12","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0275-5319","1878-3384","","RES INT BUS FINANC","Res.

Understanding the topology of the LN is crucial, not only because it is key to performance, but also for ensuring its security and privacy guarantees. The topology of the LN affects, among others, the ability to successfully route payments between nodes, its resilience (against both attacks and random failures), and the privacy of payments. Existing research on LN topology focuses on studying the degree, betweenness, and closeness as metrics that better describe the centrality of nodes. However, to the best of our knowledge, previous studies do not encompass the network as a whole because of the limitation of using only the capacity of channels as its principal property. The contributions of this study are two-fold. On the one hand, this paper discusses the application of classic centrality metrics for evaluating the centrality in the LN. On the other hand, we provide alternative metrics to evaluate centrality. Our approach extends the analysis by adding metrics (strength, Opsahl, current-flow betweenness) and network properties (capacity, fee, balance, channel, and pending Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs)). Based on the results obtained using these metrics, we provide an in-depth analysis of the metric that best defines the centrality of this network.","[Oleas-Chavez, Luis E.; Herrera-Joancomarti, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona UAB, Dept Informat Engn & Commun, Barcelona, Spain; [Perez-Sola, Cristina] Univ Oberta Catalunya, Internet Interdisciplinary Inst IN3, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Perez-Sola, Cristina; Herrera-Joancomarti, Jordi] Ctr Cybersecur Res Catalonia CYBERCAT, Barcelona 08860, Spain","","Oleas-Chavez, LE (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona UAB, Dept Informat Engn & Commun, Barcelona, Spain.","luis.oleas@autonoma.cat","","Perez-Sola, Cristina/0000-0001-7534-1326","Spanish Government [RTI2018-095094-B-C22 ``CONSENT]","Spanish Government(Spanish GovernmentEuropean Commission)","This work was supported in part by the Spanish Government under Grant RTI2018-095094-B-C22 ``CONSENT.''","","25","0","0","4","4","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","55469","55487","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3174549","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3174549","","","19","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","1T4EB","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000804682900001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It is regarded as a decentralized, trustworthy, secure, transparent, and immutable solution that innovates data sharing and management. This survey aims to provide a systematic review of Blockchain application to intelligent transportation systems in general and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) in particular. The survey is divided into four main parts. First, the Blockchain technology including its opportunities, relative taxonomies, and applications is introduced; basic cryptography is also discussed. Next, the evolution of Blockchain is presented, starting from the primary phase of pre-Bitcoin (fundamentally characterized by classic cryptography systems), followed by the Blockchain 1.0 phase, (characterized by Bitcoin implementation and common consensus protocols), and finally, the Blockchain 2.0 phase (characterized by the implementation of smart contracts, Ethereum, and Hyperledger). We compared and identified the strengths and limitations of each of these implementations. Then, the state of the art of Blockchain-based IoV solutions (BIoV) is explored by referring to a large and trusted source database from the Scopus data bank. For a well-structured and clear discussion, the reviewed literature is classified according to the research direction and implemented IoV layer. Useful tables, statistics, and analysis are also presented. Finally, the open problems and future directions in BIoV research are summarized.","[Jabbar, Rateb; Zaidan, Esmat] Qatar Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Int Affairs, Doha, Qatar; [Jabbar, Rateb; Barkaoui, Kamel] Conservatoire Natl Arts & Metiers, Comp Sci Dept, Cedr Lab, F-75141 Paris, France; [Dhib, Eya] Higher Sch Commun Tunis, Mediatron Lab, Tunis 2083, Tunisia; [Said, Ahmed Ben; Fetais, Noora] Qatar Univ, Coll Engn, Doha, Qatar; [Krichen, Moez] Univ Sfax, Natl Sch Engn Sfax, ReDCAD Lab, Sfax 3029, Tunisia","","Jabbar, R (corresponding author), Qatar Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Int Affairs, Doha, Qatar.;Jabbar, R (corresponding author), Conservatoire Natl Arts & Metiers, Comp Sci Dept, Cedr Lab, F-75141 Paris, France.","rateb.jabbar@qu.edu.qa","; Fetais, Noora/I-2095-2016","Ben Said, Ahmed/0000-0002-7760-8132; Fetais, Noora/0000-0003-3609-2659; Zaidan, Esmat/0000-0001-7813-3362; Jabbar, Rateb/0000-0002-4886-6458","Qatar National Research Fund (a member of the Qatar Foundation) through the National Priorities Research Program (NPRP) [NPRP11S-1228-170142]","Qatar National Research Fund (a member of the Qatar Foundation) through the National Priorities Research Program (NPRP)","This work was supported by the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of the Qatar Foundation) through the National Priorities Research Program (NPRP) under Grant NPRP11S-1228-170142.","","487","5","5","53","53","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","20995","21031","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3149958","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3149958","","","37","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","ZM1NB","","gold, Green Published","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000764130600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We applied the Bayesian Dynamic Conditional Correlation-Multivariate GARCH (DCC-MGARCH) models using US daily data from 2 January 2019 to 26 February 2021. Our results suggest that the fossil fuel (WTI crude oil and natural gas) and financial markets (clean energy stock, gold, and Bitcoin) generally had negative relationships in 2019 before the pandemic prevailed, but they became positive for a while in mid-2020, alternating between positive (0.8) and negative values (-0.8). As it is known that negative relationships are required among assets to hedge the risk of price changes, this implies that stakeholders need to be cautious in hedging the risk across the fossil fuel and financial markets when a crisis like COVID-19 occurs. However, our study also revealed that such negative relationships only lasted for three to six months, suggesting that the effects of the pandemic were short term and that stakeholders in the fossil fuel markets could cross hedge with the financial markets in the long term.","[Tang, Chaofeng; Aruga, Kentaka] Saitama Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Sakura Ku, 255 Shimo Okubo, Saitama 3388570, Japan","","Aruga, K (corresponding author), Saitama Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Sakura Ku, 255 Shimo Okubo, Saitama 3388570, Japan.","chaofengtang88@yahoo.co.jp; aruga@mail.saitama-u.ac.jp","Aruga, Kentaka/M-1216-2017","Aruga, Kentaka/0000-0003-3033-272X","","","","","48","2","2","7","15","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2071-1050","","SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL","Sustainability","JAN","2022","14","1","","","","","","","51","10.3390/su14010051","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14010051","","","22","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","YT2IT","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000751190000001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

One of the fundamental building blocks for Blockchain is Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). Nevertheless, when processing a large number of transactions, the verification of multiple signatures will incur cumbersome overhead to the nodes in Blockchain. Although batch verification is able to provide a promising approach that verifies multiple signatures simultaneously and efficiently, the upper bound of batch size is limited to small-scale and the efficiency will drop rapidly as the batch size grows in the state-of-the-art ECDSA batch schemes. Meanwhile, most of the existing researches only focus on improving the efficiency of batch verification algorithms in various cryptosystem while ignoring the identification of invalid signatures, which could cause severe performance degradation when the batch verification fails. Motivated by these observations, this paper proposes an efficient and large-scale batch verification scheme with group testing technology based on ECDSA. The application of the presented protocols in Bitcoin and Hyperledger Fabric has been analyzed as supportive and effective. When the batch verification returns a false result, we utilize group testing technology to improve the efficiency of identifying invalid signatures. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our protocol outperforms the related ECDSA batch verification schemes.","[Xiong, Hu; Jin, Chuanjie; Wang, Hanxiao] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat & Software Engn, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China; [Alazab, Mamoun] Charles Darwin Univ, Coll Engn IT & Environm, Casuarina, NT 0810, Australia; [Yeh, Kuo-Hui] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Informat Management, Hualien 97401, Taiwan; [Gadekallu, Thippa Reddy] Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Informat Technol & Engn, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India; [Wang, Weizheng] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Su, Chunhua] Univ Aizu, Div Comp Sci, Fukushima 9658580, Japan","","Wang, WZ (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","xionghu.uestc@gmail.com; jinchuanjie.uestc@gmail.com; alazab.m@ieee.org; khyeh@gms.ndhu.edu.tw; wanghanxiao.uestc@gmail.com; thippareddy.g@vit.ac.in; weizheng.wang@ieee.org; chsu@u-aizu.ac.jp","Gadekallu, Thippa Reddy/T-4254-2019","Gadekallu, Thippa Reddy/0000-0003-0097-801X; Alazab, Mamoun/0000-0002-1928-3704; Wang, Weizheng/0000-0002-5879-585X; Xiong, Hu/0000-0001-6137-6667; Yeh, Kuo-Hui/0000-0003-0598-761X","Natural Science Foundation of China [U1936101, 61902054]; Sichuan Science, and Technology Program [2021YFG0164, 2021JDRC0072]","Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Sichuan Science, and Technology Program","This work was supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants U1936101 and 61902054, and in part by the Sichuan Science, and Technology Program under Grants 2021YFG0164 and 2021JDRC0072.","","39","41","41","6","11","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2168-2194","2168-2208","","IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH","IEEE J.

LN uses offchain micropayment channels to scale the blockchain's capability to perform instant transactions without a global block confirmation process. However, micropayment scalability in a large LN is still limited by its relatively large searching space for a suitable route. Liquidation for small nodes still remains major challenges for the LN as the amount of transactions along a channel is predetermined by the channel capacity defined by two end nodes of the channel. In this paper, we introduce the notion of supernodes and the corresponding supernodes-based pooling to address these challenges. In order to meet the high adaptivity and low maintenance cost in the dynamic LN where users join and leave, supernodes are constructed locally to avoid global information or label propagation. Each supernode, together with a subset of (non-supernodes) neighbors, forms a supernode-based pool. These pools constitute a partition of the LN. Additionally, supernodes are self-connected. Micropayment scalability is supported through node set reduction as only supernodes are involved in searching and in payment with other supernodes. Liquidation is enhanced through pooling to redistribute funds within a pool to external channels of its supernode. Extensive simulations using LN simulator CLoTH have been conducted to validate the improvement in routing scalability and liquidation of the proposed architecture under different settings.","[Wu, Jie; Jiang, Suhan] Temple Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","","Wu, J (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.","jiewu@temple.edu; suhan.jiang@temple.edu","","","NSF [2128378, 2107014, 2150152, 1824440, 1828363, 1757533]; ARO [W911NF17-1-0378]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ARO","This work was supported in part by NSF under Grants 2128378, 2107014, 2150152, 1824440, 1828363, and 1757533, and in part by ARO under Grant W911NF17-1-0378.

Indeed, this paper is the first study to ascertain whether green commodities, Bitcoins, and uncertainty are connected to the US stock market. Using the quantile vector autoregressive (VAR) connectedness framework, the key findings are as follows: (i) A static spillover network showed there was high spillover transfer between markets at extreme market states. (ii) Global green economy and global clean energy markets act as the highest contributors of information spillover under bearish market scenarios. (iii) With regard to dynamic connectedness, this work highlights the asymmetric spillover effect of green commodities, Bitcoins, and uncertainty on the US stock market.

Considering cryptocurrency's volatility and unique characteristics, accurate price prediction is essential for developing successful investment strategies. To this end, the authors of this work propose a novel framework that predicts the price of Bitcoin (BTC), a dominant cryptocurrency. For stable prediction performance in unseen price range, the change point detection technique is employed. In particular, it is used to segment time-series data so that normalization can be separately conducted based on segmentation. In addition, on-chain data, the unique records listed on the blockchain that are inherent in cryptocurrencies, are collected and utilized as input variables to predict prices. Furthermore, this work proposes self-attention-based multiple long short-term memory (SAM-LSTM), which consists of multiple LSTM modules for on-chain variable groups and the attention mechanism, for the prediction model. Experiments with real-world BTC price data and various method setups have proven the proposed framework's effectiveness in BTC price prediction. The results are promising, with the highest MAE, RMSE, MSE, and MAPE values of 0.3462, 0.5035, 0.2536, and 1.3251, respectively.","[Kim, Gyeongho; Choi, Jae Gyeong; Lim, Sunghoon] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Shin, Dong-Hyun] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Lim, Sunghoon] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Inst Ind Revolut 4, Ulsan 44919, South Korea","","Lim, S (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.;Lim, S (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Inst Ind Revolut 4, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.","sunghoonlim@unist.ac.kr","Kim, Gyeongho/GNM-8765-2022; Lim, Sunghoon/W-6660-2018","Kim, Gyeongho/0000-0001-7486-8628; Lim, Sunghoon/0000-0001-9534-7397","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant through the Korea Government (MSIT) [2021R1F1A1046416]; AI Collaboration Project Fund of Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) [1.220083]","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant through the Korea Government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); AI Collaboration Project Fund of Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST)","This work was supported in part by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant through the Korea Government (MSIT) under Grant 2021R1F1A1046416, and in part by the AI Collaboration Project Fund of Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) under Grant 1.220083.","","82","0","0","2","2","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","56232","56248","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3177888","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3177888","","","17","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","1T3ML","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000804637100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

So, preventing selfish mining is an important objective. There have been a few attempts to prevent selfish mining. In this work, we focus on alternative difficulty adjustment algorithms that try to discourage selfish miners by extending their waiting time for selfish mining to become profitable, Zeno's DAA in particular. We propose two extensions on Zeno's DAA: 1) Zeno's Max DAA, which increase the difficulty in one step but decreases it in multiple steps, and 2) Zeno's Parametric DAA that has a parameter that can be tuned to control the rate of the decrement (or increment) in the value of difficulty. We evaluate these two alternatives DAAs and show that Zeno's Max performs better than Zeno's for scalability of the network and scales the network faster. Also, Zeno's Parametric is a family of DAAs that not only has the default DAA and Zeno's DAA as its members but also can include anything in between or even DAAs more conservative than Zeno's, which decrease the difficulty even slower than Zeno's.","[Azimy, Hamid; Ghorbani, Ali] Univ New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada","","Azimy, H (corresponding author), Univ New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada.","hazimy@unb.ca; ghorbani@unb.ca","","","Tier 1 Canada Research Chair; Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC)","Tier 1 Canada Research Chair(Canada Research Chairs); Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC)","The authors graciously acknowledge the funding support from the Tier 1 Canada Research Chair to Dr. Ghorbani, and the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC).","","30","0","0","3","3","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-96527-3; 978-3-030-96526-6","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2022","12991","","","","","","59","73","","10.1007/978-3-030-96527-3_5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-96527-3_5","","","15","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS8OI","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000774309000005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Blockchain, the technology that underpins these digital currencies, has drawn considerable interest from the academic community and the business community, including on Twitter. Aside from security and privacy, the blockchain has several other advantages. The average time it takes for a transaction to be validated and stored in each peer node so that it cannot be reversed or revoked is used to measure the performance of blockchain networks. Even though this is referred to as throughput, it should not be confused with the number of transactions processed at any given time. To put it another way, the ability of a blockchain network to handle more transactions and more nodes is called scalability. Yet, scalability is problematic to reach a more robust platform of users and transaction load. We will focus on scalability issues and ways to maintain them efficiently. We will also go through the research challenges and future work for blockchain. Hence, researchers working on blockchain have aimed for a lower level of scalability to let the network's throughput growsub-linearly because the size of the network increases. The resulting schemes are mostly mentioned as scale-out blockchains. We have heard of Sharding, Lightning Network or Ethereum Plasma and Matic; they all will be considered as scale-out solutions to the matter of blockchain scalability.","[Pandey, Anova Ajay; Tyagi, Amit Kumar] Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; [Fernandez, Terrance Frederick] Saveetha Sch Engn, Saveetha Inst Med & Tech Sci SIMATS, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Chennai, TN, India; [Bansal, Rohit] Vaish Coll Engn, Dept Management Studies, Rohtak, Haryana, India; [Tyagi, Amit Kumar] Vellore Inst Technol, Ctr Adv Data Sci, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","","Tyagi, AK (corresponding author), Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.;Tyagi, AK (corresponding author), Vellore Inst Technol, Ctr Adv Data Sci, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.","anovaajay.pandey2019@vitstudent.ac.in; frederick@pec.edu","","Bansal, Rohit/0000-0001-7072-5005; Fernandez, Terrance Frederick/0000-0002-7317-3362","","","","","26","0","0","1","1","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","2367-3370","2367-3389","978-3-030-96308-8; 978-3-030-96307-1","LECT NOTE NETW SYST","","","2022","418","","","","","","34","45","","10.1007/978-3-030-96308-8_4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-96308-8_4","","","12","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT0SK","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000791055300004","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The prices of cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and follow stochastic moments and have reached their unpredictable limits. They are commonly used for investment and have become a substitute for other types of investment like metals, estates, and the stock market. Their importance in the market raises the strict requirement for a sturdy forecasting model. However, cryptocurrency price prediction is quite challenging due to its dependency on other cryptocurrencies. Many researchers have used machine learning and deep learning models, and other market sentiment-based models to predict the price of cryptocurrencies. As all the cryptocurrencies belong to a specific class, we can infer that the increase in the price of one cryptocurrency can lead to a price change for other cryptocurrencies. Researchers had also utilized the sentiments from tweets and other social media platforms to increase the performance of their proposed system. Motivated by these, in this paper, we propose a hybrid and robust framework, DL-Gues, for cryptocurrency price prediction, that considers its interdependency on other cryptocurrencies and also on market sentiments. We have considered price prediction of Dash carried out using price history and tweets of Dash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin for various loss functions for validation.

A cryptocurrency is a digital means of exchange that uses encryption techniques to manage the creation of monetary units and verify the transfer of funds. A blockchain is a decentralised ledger that records all peer-to-peer transactions. Blockchain is also recognised as the protocol of trust. This security concept uses decentralisation to establish a global index of all financial transactions that occur in a distinct network and makes them absolute.Blockchain technology establishes trust and harmony in direct communication between two parties without the involvement of a third party. Participants can confirm transactions without the requirement for a central clearing authority using this technology. Third-party trusted intermediaries have a character for triggering transaction delays. There would be speedier reconciliation between transacting parties and participants if such intermediaries were not present. In addition, the Internet of Things is a new technology that allows virtual and physical items to link and communicate with one another, resulting in the creation of new digitised services. When the number of devices connected through an IoT network grows. However, this data is not encrypted; it does not provide privacy.In this regard, blockchain technology might give massive benefits because it can quickly secure the anonymity of the obtained data. Furthermore, Blockchain can assist in solving most of the security vulnerabilities and traceability concerns in financial transactions by keeping track of how devices interact.In this state, they are, and how they transact with other IoT devices. A blockchain is hack-resistant and has a low danger of being hacked to improve data security.This article aims to explain the structure and operation of Blockchain and IoT in the context of securing financial transactions in the cryptocurrency market.Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

From this comes the risk and the benefit in the absence of a possible regulation. On these situations, in this text, an analysis is made on the identification and characterization of a problem of financial and public ethics in the scene of cryptocurrencies, in addition to the relationship and comparison of their behavior with other currencies and the position of entities International such as NYSE (New York Stock Exchange, in Spanish, New York Stock Exchange), CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in Spanish, Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the USA) and Banco de la Republica in Colombia. The fundamental purpose of this text is the clear and theoretical rationalization around cryptocurrencies as an investment alternative and their ethical costs in correspondence to their operation in the Colombian financial state and their risk status in exchange rate normalization. The characterization of how Bitcoin managed to become a desired asset and belonging in the market and accredited in the North American economy was deployed and its characteristics were leveled, events which have led to the spread of the cryptocurrency.

One side sees any cryptocurrency as a financial utopia: an egalitarian technology free from centralized monetary authorities. The other sees this same technology as merely a novel mechanism for enabling more crime, corruption, and money laundering. Both positions contain an element of truth, but both share a common misapprehension: They assume that digital assets are beyond the reach of law enforcement and regulatory agencies - which is decidedly not the case, at least for now. But the digital asset economy evolves rapidly. To stay ahead of the curve, authorities will need to adapt existing rules and regulations about money-laundering, sanctions, and sending funds to rogue states - tools originally designed for an entirely different financial infrastructure - to mitigate threats to the financial system posed by virtual assets.","[Arnold, Aaron] Royal United Serv, Ctr Financial Crime & Secur Studies, London, England","","Arnold, A (corresponding author), Royal United Serv, Ctr Financial Crime & Secur Studies, London, England.","AaronA@rusi.org","","","","","","","19","0","0","2","2","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0096-3402","1938-3282","","B ATOM SCI","Bull.

The most applied coin selection method that UTXO-based cryptocurrencies currently employ is an algorithm that decides on a certain set of UTXOs that matches the target amount and limits the transaction fee. However this approach trades off favourable maintenance overhead of the entire network for low transaction fees, as many low-value UTXOs known as dust is produced. Over time, this will impact the scalability and management of the cryptocurrency network as the global set of UTXOs become larger. Therefore, there is an urgency to find a higher-performing coin selection method suitable for UTXO-based cryptocurrencies. This paper proposes a method based on the greedy and genetic algorithm for effectively choosing sets of UTXOs in Bitcoin. The main objective of this coin selection strategy is to get as close as possible to the target while also maintaining and possibly reducing the number of UTXO inputs.","[Wei, Xuelin; Wu, Chang; Yu, Haoran; Liu, Siyan] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, 2006 Xiyuan Ave, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Yihong] Univ Sydney, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia","","Wu, C (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, 2006 Xiyuan Ave, Chengdu, Peoples R China.","202021010312@std.uestc.edu.cn; changwu@uestc.edu.cn; annieyuan4@gmail.com","","","","","","","27","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","2199-4536","2198-6053","","COMPLEX INTELL SYST","COMPLEX INTELL.

Currently, there is a move to introduce regulations for crypto trading. The purpose of the current research was to study the effect of trait reactance and messages about freedom-protecting (vs. freedom-restricting) crypto regulations on an individual's attitude toward cryptocurrency and buying intention. The following mediators were examined: (1) positive affect and (2) negative affect (i.e., anger). A total of 566 people took part in a 2 (regulation content: freedom-protecting vs. freedom-restricting) x trait reactance (continuous) between-participants design. The freedom message emphasized that regulations would support an individual investor's right to invest in crypto. The restriction message stated that crypto trading would be restricted to professional investors. Trait reactance was measured with Hong and Page's (1989) Psychological Reactance scale. Results indicated that trait reactance had a positive effect on state reactance and positive affect. The effect of trait reactance on crypto buying intention was mediated by positive affect and anger. Freedom (vs. restriction) messages were associated with an increase in positive affect and decrease in anger. Freedom messages about crypto investing generate a more positive response than messages outlining restrictions to crypto investing.","[Martin, Brett A.

The question then arises whether CCs with similar statistical key figures exist. On this basis, a core market incorporating CCs with comparable properties enables the implementation of a tracking error approach. A prerequisite for this is the segmentation of the CC market into a core and a satellite, with the latter comprising the accumulation of the residual CCs remaining in the complement.

In this study, we propose an iterative kappa architecture that collects, processes, and temporarily stores data regarding transactions and tweets of two of the major cryptocurrencies according to their market capitalization: Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). We applied a k-means clustering approach to group data according to their principal characteristics. Data are categorized into three groups: BTC typical data, ETH typical data, BTC and ETH atypical data. Findings show that activity on Twitter correlates to activity regarding the transactions of cryptocurrencies. It was also found that around 14% of data relate to extraordinary behaviors regarding cryptocurrencies. These data contain higher transaction volumes of both cryptocurrencies, and about 9.5% more social media publications in comparison with the rest of the data. The main advantages of the proposed architecture are its flexibility and its ability to relate data from various datasets.","[Barradas, Adrian; Tejeda-Gil, Acela; Canton-Croda, Rosa-Maria] UPAEP Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Puebla 72410, Mexico","","Barradas, A (corresponding author), UPAEP Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Puebla 72410, Mexico.","adrian.barradas@upaep.edu.mx; acela.tejeda@upaep.edu.mx; rosamaria.canton@upaep.mx","","Barradas, Adrian/0000-0002-5477-2976","UPAEP-University","UPAEP-University","This research received no external funding.

In cryptocurrencies, records are stored using a cryptographic algorithm. The main aim of this research was to develop an optimal solution for predicting the price of cryptocurrencies based on user opinions from social media. Twitter is used as a marketing tool for cryptoanalysis owing to the unrestricted conversations on cryptocurrencies that take place on social media channels. Therefore, this work focuses on extracting Tweets and gathering data from different sources to classify them into positive, negative, and neutral categories, and further examining the correlations between cryptocurrency movements and Tweet sentiments. This paper proposes an optimized method using a deep learning algorithm and convolution neural network for cryptocurrency prediction; this method is used to predict the prices of four cryptocurrencies, namely, Litecoin, Monero, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. The results of analyses demonstrate that the proposed method forecasts prices with a high accuracy of about 98.75%. The method is validated by comparison with existing methods using visualization tools.","[Hasan, Syed H.] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA USA; [Hasan, Syeda Huyam] Univ Texas Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Ahmed, Mohammed Salih] Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Coll Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dammam, Saudi Arabia; [Hasan, Syed Hamid] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Dept Informat Syst, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","","Hasan, SH (corresponding author), King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Dept Informat Syst, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.","shhasan@kau.edu.sa","","","","","","","30","2","2","2","15","TECH SCIENCE PRESS","HENDERSON","871 CORONADO CENTER DR, SUTE 200, HENDERSON, NV 89052 USA","1546-2218","1546-2226","","CMC-COMPUT MATER CON","CMC-Comput.

Recently, researchers have aimed to improve the performance of price prediction methods by applying deep learning-based models. However, most studies have focused on predicting cryptocurrency prices for the following day. Therefore, clients are inconvenienced by the necessity of rapidly making complex decisions on actions that support maximizing their profit, such as Sell, Buy, and Wait. Furthermore, very few studies have explored the use of deep learning models to make recommendations for these actions, and the performance of such models remains low. Therefore, to solve these problems, we propose a deep learning model and three input features: sellProfit, buyProfit, and maxProfit. Through these concepts, clients are provided with criteria on which action would be most beneficial at a given current time. These criteria can be used as decision-making indices to facilitate profit maximization. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, daily price data of six representative cryptocurrencies were used to conduct an experiment. The results confirm that the proposed model showed approximately 13% to 21% improvement over existing methods and is statistically significant.","[Park, Jaehyun; Seo, Yeong-Seok] Yeungnam Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Gyongsan 38541, South Korea","","Seo, YS (corresponding author), Yeungnam Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Gyongsan 38541, South Korea.","kat3160@yu.ac.kr; ysseo@yu.ac.kr","","Seo, Yeong-Seok/0000-0002-5319-7674","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2020R1I1A3073313]","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Education (MOE), Republic of KoreaNational Research Council for Economics, Humanities & Social Sciences, Republic of Korea)","This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2020R1I1A3073313).","","44","0","0","1","1","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2079-9292","","ELECTRONICS-SWITZ","Electronics","MAY","2022","11","9","","","","","","","1466","10.3390/electronics11091466","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics11091466","","","19","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Physics","1E7PY","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000794676800001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We consider MAC global solar energy index (RMGS) and ISE global wind energy index (RIGW) as proxies of the energy market and use bitcoin and the European energy exchange carbon index (REEX) for the cryptocurrency and carbon market. Employing the Diebold and Yilmaz (2012), Barunik and Krehlik (2018), and wavelet coherence econometric techniques, we find that the energy market (RMGS) has the highest connectedness derived from other asset classes, and bitcoin (RBTC) has the least connectedness. Concurrently, we find that the risk transmission is heterogeneous in different scales as the short period has less connectedness than the medium and long run. We conclude that the overall diversification opportunity among green bonds, energy stock, bitcoin, and the carbon market is more in the short-run than in the medium and long-run. In summary, our findings on the green bond market will provide investors, portfolio managers, and policymakers with critical insight into ensuring a sustainable financial market.","[Yadav, Miklesh Prasad] Amity Univ, Noida, India; [Kumar, Satish] Malviya Natl Inst Technol Jaipur, Dept Management Studies, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India; [Mukherjee, Deepraj] Kent State Univ, Ambassador Crawford Coll Business & Entrepreneurs, Dept Econ, Kent, OH 44240 USA; [Rao, Purnima] Fortune Inst Int Business, Delhi 110057, India","","Kumar, S (corresponding author), Malviya Natl Inst Technol Jaipur, Dept Management Studies, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.","miklesh12@gmail.com; skumar.dms@mnit.ac.in; dmukherj@kent.edu; purnima.rao@fiib.edu.in","KUMAR, SATISH/M-8694-2017","KUMAR, SATISH/0000-0001-5200-1476","CAUL","CAUL","Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions","","71","0","0","2","2","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","0944-1344","1614-7499","","ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R","Environ.

Design/methodology/approach This study adopts a quantile regression approach to determine the effect of investor attention on crash risk. Crash risk is measured using the negative coefficient of skewness and down up volatility. Findings This study finds that the connection is concentrated in the tails of the crash risk distribution. Investor attention has a positive relationship with crash risk when crash risk is low (below-median quantiles) and negative when crash risk is high (above-median). The findings are consistent for different measures of crash risk, for alternate internet searches and for a panel of large cryptocurrencies in addition to Bitcoin. This study also notes seasonality in crash risk, with higher crash risk during the June-August period and lower crash risk in the Halloween period that runs from November to April. Originality/value The results provide insights that are not apparent in previous analyses of cryptocurrency price crash risk. The results are particularly important for retail investors, who constitute a large portion of the cryptocurrency market, as they tend to hold concentrated investments and so a price crash of a single asset may have a large bearing on their wealth.","[Smales, Lee A.] Univ Western Australia, UWA Business Sch, Perth, WA, Australia","","Smales, LA (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, UWA Business Sch, Perth, WA, Australia.","lee.smales@uwa.edu.au","","Smales, Lee/0000-0002-9094-9089","","","","","38","0","0","0","2","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1086-7376","1755-6791","","STUD ECON FINANC","Stud.

Design/methodology/approach Dummy regression model is used to examine the presence of the TOM effect and to test the efficiency of the cryptocurrency market. The characteristics of the returns during TOM days are compared with that of the non-non-TOM trading days. The authors also develop a trading strategy to earn abnormal returns using the TOM effect. Findings The authors show that TOM returns are positive and significantly higher than that of non-TOM returns. Interestingly, the authors empirically show that the TOM effect is not driven by the day-of-the-week (DOW) effect or the January effect. Based on the significant TOM effect, the authors formulate a trading strategy that annually outperforms the buy-and-hold strategy for BIT by 21.77% and for LIT by 47.10%. Finally, the results are robust to using a Generailzed Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) (1,1) model and the January 2018 sell-off. Practical implications The results have important implications for both traders and investors. The findings suggest that the investors might be able to earn excess profits by timing their positions in BIT and LIT taking the advantage of the TOM effect. Originality/value First, the authors provide the only study to report the evidence of the TOM effect in three leading cryptocurrencies, viz., BIT, LIT and ETH. Second, the authors control for the DOW effect and the January effect while investigating the TOM effect in cryptocurrency market. Finally, this study develops a trading strategy based on which the investors can time the cryptocurrency markets as indicated by the pattern of the TOM effect during the studied time period.","[Kumar, Satish] IBS Hyderabad ICFAI Fdn Higher Educ, Hyderabad, India","","Kumar, S (corresponding author), IBS Hyderabad ICFAI Fdn Higher Educ, Hyderabad, India.","satishwar1985@gmail.com","","Kumar, Satish/0000-0001-5625-8877","","","","","27","1","1","2","2","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","0307-4358","1758-7743","","MANAG FINANC","Manag.

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative methodology was used and primary data gathered via telephone interviews with sixteen managers of casino hotels. The researchers also used an observation technique for data collection in order to better analyse the existing case situation. Findings Although the findings show similarities in the stakeholders' awareness of cryptocurrencies, they lack overall knowledge of BCTs. The responses of participants indicate a lack of knowledge regarding the use of BCTs, particularly the areas in which they can be used. North Cyprus' tourism and hotel sectors are significantly behind the curve in terms of adopting innovative technologies, due to traditional operational concerns and to the limited scope of policy development. Research limitations/implications Policymakers should consider the practical implications for both the sector's and the country's resources in order to maximize environmental and financial gains. Practical implications The promotion of sustainable tourism can be facilitated by the wider adoption of BCTs as it could enable operators to manage their network relationships and business operations in a more socially and environmentally responsible manner.

Regardless this 'consensus', there are decentralised Internet-based applications on which blockchain technology can actually solve several problems and improve the functionality of these applications. The development of these new blockchain-based solutions is grouped into a new paradigm called Blockchain 3.0 and its concepts go far beyond the well-known cryptocurrencies.

Accurate prediction of the digital currency is an urgent necessity due to its impacts on the economic community. The electronic economy is very dangerous and must be approached with great caution, so as to avoid or minimize the risks that occur in such cases. Deep neural network (DNN) algorithm was improved to predict the Bitcoin price and then achieve the main goal of reducing financial risks to proceed with electronic business, and good estimation was achieved by using informative data such as transactions and currency return. The proposed method extracted features of related Bitcoin and used the informative ones. Transaction plan considered building nodes in terms of network.

The current paper develops a probabilistic theory of causation using measure-theoretical concepts and suggests practical routines for conducting causal inference. The theory is applicable to both linear and high-dimensional nonlinear models. An example is provided using random forest regressions and daily data on yield spreads. The application tests how uncertainty in short- and long-term inflation expectations interacts with spreads in the daily Bitcoin price. The results are contrasted with those obtained by standard linear Granger causality tests. It is shown that the suggested measure-theoretic approaches do not only lead to better predictive models, but also to more plausible parsimonious descriptions of possible causal flows. The paper concludes that researchers interested in causal analysis should be more aspirational in terms of developing predictive capabilities, even if the interest is in inference and not in prediction per se. The theory developed in the paper provides practitioners guidance for developing causal models using new machine learning methods that have, so far, remained relatively underutilized in this context.","[Andree, Bo Pieter Johannes] World Bank, Dev Econ Data Grp, Analyt & Tool Unit, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Andree, Bo Pieter Johannes] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Spatial Econ, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","","Andree, BPJ (corresponding author), World Bank, Dev Econ Data Grp, Analyt & Tool Unit, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.;Andree, BPJ (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Spatial Econ, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.","bandree@worldbank.org","","Andree, Bo/0000-0002-8007-5007","","","","","87","0","0","3","5","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1099-4300","","ENTROPY-SWITZ","Entropy","JAN","2022","24","1","","","","","","","92","10.3390/e24010092","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e24010092","","","24","Physics, Multidisciplinary","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Physics","YN2RC","35052117","gold, Green Published","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000747109200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

By splitting the parameter vector into sub-vectors, the algorithm maximizes the log-likelihood function alternatingly with respect to one sub-vector while keeping the others constant. For situations when the algorithm is initialized with a consistent estimator and is iterated sufficiently often, we establish the asymptotic equivalence of the zig-zag estimator and the infeasible ML estimator being numerically approximated. This result gives guidance for practical implementations. We illustrate how to employ the algorithm in different estimation problems, such as in a vine copula model and a vector autoregressive moving average model.

However, reliable prevalence estimates of this molecular alteration and its prognostic role have not been fully elucidated. Methods: A retrospective mono-institutional series of 286 patients affected by locally advanced or metastatic BTC (183 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, 67 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, 36 gallbladder carcinomas) was profiled by means of targeted DNA/RNA next-generation sequencing, immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridisation for FGFR2/3, ERBB2, NTRK alterations, IDH1/2 and BRAF mutations and DNA mismatch repair complex proteins alterations/microsatellite instability. Results: FGFR2 rearrangements, amplifications and point mutations were detected in 15 (5.2 %), 1 and 3 cases, respectively. FGFR3 alterations were observed in 5 (1.7%) cases. IDH1/2 were mutated in 35/223 cases (15.7%). A total of 9/258 (3.5%) and 6/260 (2.3%) BTCs had ERBB2 and BRAF gene alterations, respectively. Two cases (2/242; 0.8%) had NTRK1 amplifications but no rearrangement was found. A deficit of mismatch repair protein expres-sion was identified in 9/237 cases (3.8%). At multivariate analysis, age, ECOG performance status, number of metastatic sites, tumour stage, FGFR2/3 alterations and IDH1/2 mutations were prognostic factors of overall survival. Conclusions: These data provide a strong proof -challenged with a robust and detailed multi-variate model -that FGFR2/3 aberrations (including FGFR2 rearrangements) and IDH1/2 mutations can be prognostic for better survival in patients with BTC . The recognition and the measurement of their prognostic impact could be of primary importance for the correct interpretation of currently available data and in the design of new therapeutic trials.@ 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

At the same time, using the integrated empirical mode decomposition and run-length determination method, the time series data of gold and bitcoin are divided into cycles, and the LSTM neural network model is trained and verified, and finally the gold bitcoin price prediction model is obtained, the mean absolute error and root mean square error of Bitcoin are significantly larger than those of gold, and the price volatility of Bitcoin is known to be higher than that of gold, so the instability of Bitcoin is weaker than that of gold.","[Sun, Chengjin; Wang, Songyu; Song, Qianrui; Zhu, Shuai; Heng, Jun; Lei, Lijuan] Henan Agr Univ, Sch Informat & Management Sci, Zhengzhou 450046, Peoples R China","","Lei, LJ (corresponding author), Henan Agr Univ, Sch Informat & Management Sci, Zhengzhou 450046, Peoples R China.","Leilijuan1225@163.com","","","","","","","8","0","0","1","1","SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING","BELLINGHAM","1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","0277-786X","1996-756X","978-1-5106-5520-1; 978-1-5106-5519-5","PROC SPIE","","","2022","12259","","","","","","","","1225956","10.1117/12.2638942","http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2638942","","","7","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Mathematics, Applied","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Mathematics","BT5FQ","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000836381400185","View Full Record in Web of Science"

While, in the hourly scale, the pair Bitcoin-Ethereum presents the largest multifractal spectrum. Our empirical evidence has rejected the weak form of the EMH and clearly suggests that the dynamics of the analyzed cryptocurrency pairs are in line with the Fractal Market Hypothesis (FMH).

Such an environment can be modeled as a graph, where there are flows of information. The interest of such modeling is that (1) one can describe the exchanges through time from an initial state of the network, (2) the description can be used through the fit of a real-world case and to perform further forecasts, and (3) it can be used to trace information through time. In this paper, we review the methodology for describing diffusion processes on a network in the context of exchange of information in a crypto (Bitcoin) peer-to-peer network. Necessary definitions are posed, and the diffusion equation is derived by considering two different types of Laplacian operators. Equilibrium conditions are discussed, and analytical solutions are derived, particularly in the context of a directed graph, which constitutes the main innovation of this paper. Further innovations follow as the inclusion of boundary conditions, as well as the implementation of delay in the diffusion equation, followed by a discussion when doing approximations useful for the implementation. Numerous numerical simulations additionally illustrate the theory developed all along the paper. Specifically, we validated, through simple examples, the derived analytic solutions, and implemented them in more sophisticated graphs, e.g., the ring graph, particularly important in crypto peer-to-peer networks. As a conclusion for this article, we further developed a theory useful for fitting purposes in order to gain more information on its diffusivity, and through a modeling which the scientific community is aware of.","","","","julien.riposo@gmail.com","","Riposo, Julien/0000-0002-4228-3390","","","","","13","0","0","1","1","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

Selfish mining is the most well-known mining attack. It includes selfish mining (SM1), optimal selfish mining (E-optimal), and bribed selfish mining (BSM), etc. The mining models addressed in prior studies, however, are based on the Nakamoto consensus. Therefore, this paper proposes the ESM model (Selfish Mining under Ecological model). Our new model is fully compatible with fewer resource expenditure requirements. Meanwhile, we also describe a novel selfish mining attack that allows the malicious pool to gain additional revenue by using an ESM attack rather than SM1 when its power is less than 25%. Furthermore, we present an EBSM (Bribery Selfish Mining under Ecological) attack that combines ESM together with the bribery attack. As a result, under EBSM, the malicious solo miner has a chance to gain additional revenue. Finally, we undertake quantitative analyses and simulations to assess the effectiveness of our attacks.

We used categorical data in the analyses and Markov chain models from the first to the tenth order to propose a new way of establishing possible future scenarios, in which we analyze the dependence of memory on the dynamics of the process. We used the measurements of accuracy Mean Quadratic Error, Absolute Error Mean Percentage, and Absolute Standard Deviation for the choice of the best models. Our findings reveal that cryptocurrencies have long-range memory. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple exposed seven steps of memory, while Litecoin displayed nine memory steps. From the transitions between states that happened the most, we defined decision rules that assisted in the definition of future returns in the series.

The limited supply, high volatility, and random price fluctuations have increased investors' interest in BTC, especially in daily trading. Although BTC has been yielding a high rate of returns, price fluctuations and constant speculations make the investors wary of unexpected price movements. Predictive modeling suffers from the complexity of the datasets (i.e., the high number of features employed to forecast BTC movements) as well as the black-box nature of most machine learning algorithms (which is especially problematic for corporate investors since they are obligated to disclose their investment decisions to their clients). Therefore, the main goal of the current study is to assist individual and corporate investors in making transparent and interpretable daily BTC trading decisions by developing a predictive analytics framework. To address the complexities posed by the datasets, a comprehensive tri-level feature selection approach is proposed. The selected features are then, fed into the Classification & Regression Tree (C&RT) to build a highly parsimonious, transparent, and interpretable prediction model. The resultant model was not only evaluated on the test (holdout) sample but was also tested on challenging time periods, including the first half of 2020 (the start of the pandemic era) to exhibit the viability and reliability of the proposed framework. Finally, a decision support tool is developed for the practical implementation of the model. The tool can be used by short-term investors not only due to its highly simplistic, transparent, and interpretable structure, but also its higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity results when compared to the extant literature.","[Dolatsara, Hamidreza Ahady] Clark Univ, Sch Management, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Kibis, Eyyub; Simsek, Serhat] Montclair State Univ, Feliciano Sch Business, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA; [Caglar, Musa] Tulane Univ, Freeman Sch Business, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Dag, Ali] Creighton Univ, Heider Coll Business, Omaha, NE 68178 USA; [Dolatsara, Gelareh Ahadi] Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Management & Accounting, Tehran, Iran; [Delen, Dursun] Oklahoma State Univ, Spears Sch Business, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Delen, Dursun] Istinye Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, TR-34396 Istanbul, Turkey","","Delen, D (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Spears Sch Business, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.","hamid@clarku.edu; kibise@montclair.edu; simseks@montclair.edu; alidag@creighton.edu; dursun.delen@okstate.edu","","","","","","","46","0","0","7","7","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0957-4174","1873-6793","","EXPERT SYST APPL","Expert Syst.

Therefore, major countries such as China, Iran, Russia, Turkey, and Vietnam are banning bitcoin mining to avoid grid imbalances, power failures, and environmental issues. To alleviate these concerns, we conducted a techno-economic analysis of 50 states and a federal district (Washington D.C.) in the US in terms of the feasibility of bitcoin mining using carbon capture and renewable energy. We analyzed the profitability of bitcoin mining in the US states using grid and renewable power resources along with high-temperature and low temperature direct air capture technologies for CO2 capture and storage and methanol as a product. From both economic and environmental perspectives, we evaluated the net CO2 emission for each state to determine its competitive advantages. Overall, this work offers a holistic overview of where bitcoin mining can be economically viable across US states. Additionally, it provides insights into achieving environmentally friendly cryptocurrency mining regulations based on carbon capture and renewable energy and gauging the costs of bitcoin mining powered by the grid and high renewable penetration across the US states while pursuing carbon neutrality.","[Niaz, Haider; Liu, Jay J.] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea; [Niaz, Haider; You, Fengqi] Cornell Univ, Robert Frederick Smith Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Shams, Mohammad H.; Liu, Jay J.] Pukyong Natl Univ, Inst Cleaner Prod Technol, Busan 48547, South Korea","","You, FQ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Robert Frederick Smith Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.","fengqi.you@cornell.edu","You, Fengqi/B-5040-2011; Liu, Jay/A-9538-2013","You, Fengqi/0000-0001-9609-4299; Liu, Jay/0000-0003-4274-2355","Basic Science Research Program through the (NRF) - MIST [2019R1A2C2084709, 2021R1A4A3025742]; National Science Foundation (NSF) [1643244]","Basic Science Research Program through the (NRF) - MIST; National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea)","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the (NRF), funded by the MIST (2019R1A2C2084709, 2021R1A4A3025742) to JJL.

The authors focus on the most used and owned cryptocurrencies that cover Europe, the US and Asian countries. Design/methodology/approach An autoregressive distributed lag panel (pooled mean group and mean group) is utilized, and a robustness check is incorporated by using a Random Effect Model and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Findings Four new findings were discovered, including (1) the vaccine confidence index (VCI) pushes economic recovery and increased demand for the Bitcoin market, but the opposite result was interestingly observed from Ethereum; (2) the blockchain features were revealed to be essential to Bitcoin, while they were irrelevant to Ethereum for short-run country-specific results; (3) the hash rate and network difficulty moved inversely during the pandemic; and (4) the government played a significant role in taking action during uncertain times and regarding cryptocurrency policies. Research limitations/implications VCI is constructed by the most used vaccine type in our sample countries (i.e. Pfizer), as the data for a specific classification by each type is still unavailable. Practical implications Providing an evenly distributed vaccination program primary vaccination series against COVID-19 to the citizens is an essential duty of the government. Bitcoin policymakers and investors should watch the COVID-19 vaccine distributions closely as it will affect its return. Ethereum is emphasized to keep developing its smart contract which appeared to outplay other blockchain features. Cryptocurrency investors should be wise in their investment decisions by analysing the news thoroughly. Social implications This research emphasizes that the success in the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination requires citizens' willingness to participate and their trust in the vaccine's efficacy. Such self-awareness and self-discipline in society can ultimately empower individuals and stabilise the economy. Nevertheless, the implementation of health protocols is still highly required to prevent the spread of new variants of COVID-19. Originality/value This is the first study that attempts to construct a VCI which denotes the confidence derived from the administration of full-dose COVID-19 vaccines (an initial vaccine and a second vaccine). The authors further find the impact on cryptocurrency returns. Next, blockchain size is utilized as a new determinant of cryptocurrencies.","[Havidz, Shinta Amalina Hazrati; Tiffani, Tiffani; Calvilus, Ingrid Claudia; Angelita, Zefanya] Bina Nusantara Univ, Fac Econ & Commun, Finance Program, Accounting Dept, Jakarta Barat, Indonesia","","Havidz, SAH (corresponding author), Bina Nusantara Univ, Fac Econ & Commun, Finance Program, Accounting Dept, Jakarta Barat, Indonesia.","shinta.hg@binus.edu","Havidz, Shinta Amalina Hazrati/CAG-2454-2022","Havidz, Shinta Amalina Hazrati/0000-0001-9837-7233; , Tiffani/0000-0001-9181-0225; Angelita, Zefanya/0000-0003-2260-174X","","","","","60","0","0","3","3","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1450-2194","1758-888X","","EUROMED J BUS","EuroMed J.

However, for, the results revealed, in most cases, a negative asymmetric relationship between the yellow metal and the different stock prices, suggesting that gold can act as a good hedging instrument or a safe haven against stock prices in the long run. On the other hand, in the short run, the results indicate that only Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Maker have an asymmetric effect on the chosen stock prices but the effect is positive in most cases. Moreover, gold can act as a hedge/safe-haven asset in the short run.

With no treatment or vaccine available at the time, it was necessary to rely on non-pharmaceutical methods for case identification and contact tracing. This kind of approach has good results in detecting and preventing tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and vaccine-preventable diseases. Contact tracing and keeping safe distances are crucial to containing the spread of COVID-19. Nonetheless, contact tracing is a complex intervention, it involves quarantining and investigating close contacts. Manual contact tracing methods are slow, require a large amount of effort, and more often than not rely on the memory or assumptions of individuals. To combat these downsides, contact tracing applications were developed, resulting in quicker and more reliable recognition of infected individuals. However, because of the complex nature of these applications and their lack of transparency, a large portion of the population started doubting the privacy of the data collected. Soon after, many of these applications started to dwindle in the user department, which caused a feedback loop. If fewer people are using the application, the application itself becomes useless, and there is no longer a reason to use it. Is clear that the main issue behind their downfall was an overwhelming lack of trust. In response, this paper will analyze how the use of blockchain technology can help the development of a more transparent application. And describe how a proof of work based on this concept was implemented. On the same note, it will also approach why was Hyperledger Sawtooth chosen, instead of more popular solutions such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.","[Honorio, Tomas; Oliveira, Marco; Maximiano, Marisa] Polytech Leiria, Sch Technol & Management, Comp Sci & Commun Res Ctr CIIC, Leiria, Portugal; [Reis, Catarina, I] Polytech Leiria, Sch Technol & Management, ciTechCare Ctr Innovat Care & Hlth Technol, Leiria, Portugal","","Honorio, T (corresponding author), Polytech Leiria, Sch Technol & Management, Comp Sci & Commun Res Ctr CIIC, Leiria, Portugal.","2190338@my.ipleiria.pt; catarina.reis@ipleiria.pt","; Reis, Catarina/X-9840-2018","Oliveira, Marco/0000-0003-2189-8860; Reis, Catarina/0000-0003-1529-629X; Maximiano, Marisa/0000-0002-1212-7864","FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia, I.P.

The Lightning Network (LN) is the biggest PCN to date. As of September 2021, LN is an interconnected network with 27 thousand nodes and 71 thousand channels, representing a total payment capacity of 2500 bitcoins (114MUSD). LN nodes establish trustless payment channels by locking funds in a funding transaction. The distribution of the funds can be modified with near-instant transactions without broadcasting them to the blockchain. By chaining channels together, it is possible for two nodes to transact without having a direct channel between them. This results in far fewer transactions needing to be broadcast and a theoretical number of off-chain transactions per second that can rival established, centralized payment systems. With off-chain transactions one can obtain more privacy than with on-chain transaction: individual payments through LN should be able to stay private. However, recent research suggests that this is not the case. Several works have shown that channel balances can be tracked with the Balance Discovery Attack (BDA). Monitoring the changes in channel balances over time enables an adversary to track individual payments in LN. Since payments can travel through channels outside the scope of influence of the payer or the payee, these BDA's form an Interdependent Privacy (IDP) risk for the participants of the LN network. This work applies approximate differential privacy to hide payment amounts of a realistic size in LN. To our knowledge, this is the first time that strong privacy guarantees in the sense of approximate differential privacy are achieved in the setting of LN. We prove the feasibility with our prototype, compatible with LN today. Our solution is evaluated in terms of cost and utility and we show that the latter is not affected by our solution.

For this purpose, we conduct in-sample and out-of-sample analyses to examine the forecasting power of our model built with autoregressive components and lagged returns of BITCOIN, compared with the random walk benchmark. To this end, we considered the 13 major cryptocurrencies between 2018 and 2022. Our results indicate that our models significantly outperform the random walk benchmark. In particular, cryptocurrencies tend to be far more persistent than regular exchange rates, and BITCOIN (BTC) seems to improve the predictive accuracy of our models for some cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, while the predictive performance is time varying, we find predictive ability in different regimes before and during the pandemic crisis. We think that these results are helpful to policymakers and investors because they open a new perspective on cryptocurrency investing strategies and regulations to improve financial stability.","[Magner, Nicolas; Hardy, Nicolas] Univ Diego Portales, Fac Adm & Econ, Santiago 8370109, Chile","","Magner, N (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Fac Adm & Econ, Santiago 8370109, Chile.","nicolas.magner@udp.cl; nicolas.hardy@udp.cl","","","","","","","95","0","0","3","3","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-7390","","MATHEMATICS-BASEL","Mathematics","JUL","2022","10","13","","","","","","","2338","10.3390/math10132338","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math10132338","","","27","Mathematics","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Mathematics","2V5NK","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000823892500001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The Nakamoto consensus solves the distributed consistency problem in the public network but wastes too much computing power. Instead of consuming computing resources, many improved consensus schemes address this problem by leveraging miners' storage resources. However, these schemes fail to let miners store data constantly and usually rely on a dealer to assign data, which is hard to build a reliable decentralized storage system. In this article, we first design a variant consensus algorithm named Proof of Continuous Work (PoCW) with a storage-related incentive mechanism. Miners can accumulate mining advantage by continuously submitting proofs of storage. Then, we present a hash ring-based data allocation algorithm using the blockchain's state. Combined with both of them, we build a reliable blockchain-based storage system without relying on any third parties. The theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system has higher reliability than those existing systems, and we also give practical suggestions about system parameters. Finally, we discuss additional benefits that our system brings.","[Yin, Hao; Zhang, Zijian; He, Jialing; Zhu, Liehuang] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Cyberspace Sci & Technol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Yin, Hao; Khoussainov, Bakh] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China; [Ma, Liran] Texas Christian Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA; [Li, Meng] Hefei Univ Technol, Key Lab Knowledge Engn Big Data, Minist Educ, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China; [Li, Meng] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China","","Zhang, ZJ; Zhu, LH (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Cyberspace Sci & Technol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.","yinhao@bit.edu.cn; zhangzijian@bit.edu.cn; hejialing@bit.edu.cn; l.ma@tcu.edu; liehuangz@bit.edu.cn; mengli@hfut.edu.cn; bmk@uestc.edu.cn","","Ma, Liran/0000-0002-1003-1770; He, Jialing/0000-0002-8643-0647","National Natural Science Foundation of China [62172040, U1836212, 61872041]; Ministry of Education-China Mobile Research Fund Project [MCM20180401]; National Science Foundation of the U.S. [CNS-1912755]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education-China Mobile Research Fund Project; National Science Foundation of the U.S.(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62172040, Grant U1836212, and Grant 61872041; in part by the Ministry of Education-China Mobile Research Fund Project under Grant MCM20180401; and in part by the National Science Foundation of the U.S. under Grant CNS-1912755.","","31","0","0","5","5","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2327-4662","","","IEEE INTERNET THINGS","IEEE Internet Things J.","MAY 15","2022","9","10","","","","","7866","7875","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3115568","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2021.3115568","","","10","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","1R1EN","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000803121100061","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The modern evolution of Healthcare 4.0 applying the Internet of Things (IoT) elements with cloud computing reforms to obtain remote medical services has grown the researcher's recognition with the perspective of the smart city. The Healthcare 4.0 standard has consists of different layers to perform medical operations like periodic data sensing, data storage, data sharing, and auditing. The delicate and private medical records of victims lead to numerous difficulties while defending them from hackers. Therefore saving, obtaining, and distributing the patient medical data on the remote storage requires safety attentions so that medical records should not be compromised by the authorized user's components of E-healthcare systems. To achieve secure medical data storage, sharing, and accessing in Cloud Service Provider (CSP), various cryptography algorithms have been designed so far. But these traditional resolutions disappointed to manage the trade-off among the provisions of EHR safety in terms of computational competence, user-side verification, service-side verification, security, and without the trusted third party. Blockchain-based security techniques achieved notable recognition due to the strength to give strong security provisions for medical records storage and sharing with the least computation forces. The blockchain made focused on bitcoin technology among the researchers. Employing the blockchain in healthcare systems has been of current interest. This paper aims to present a systematic study of different blockchain-based solutions for the smart healthcare 4.0 system. The recent blockchain-based security solutions have been reviewed first and, then we presented a research gap considering the various parameters. The outcome of this paper discusses the current research gaps, the challenges of implementing the blockchain-based secure healthcare system, and the future roadmap or solutions.","[Mahajan, Hemant B.] Godwit Technol, Pune, Maharashtra, India","","Mahajan, HB (corresponding author), Godwit Technol, Pune, Maharashtra, India.","mahhemant@gmail.com","Mahajan, Hemant/AAP-2042-2020","Mahajan, Hemant/0000-0001-6703-7711","","","","","67","0","0","2","2","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0929-6212","1572-834X","","WIRELESS PERS COMMUN","Wirel.

Our study observes that proof-of-stake based cryptocurrencies are less correlated with other crypto-assets offering more opportunities for diversifying portfolio strategy. We also observe a positive correlation between the proof-of-work based cryptocurrencies and the oil price. This article discusses these matters and suggests that the differences in cryptocurrencies' dynamics are more related to their service or purpose rather than their mining protocol. This claim contributes to the current debates on the intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies and it is illustrated with a discussion of the Stellar (XLM) and Ether (ETH) cases. Beyond our empirical results, our article suggests that, the liquidity and the returns dynamics of cryptocurrencies might be affected by two different aspects. Precisely, the former appears to be influenced by the economic service for which these cryptocurrencies are used, while cryptocurrencies' returns are more reactive to the way their cryptographic validation is operated. Our findings also suggest that an analysis through the economic service/purpose of cryptocurrencies is actually appropriate to understand their dynamics in relation to economic indicators. This perspective implicitly questions the monetary aspect often associated with cryptocurrencies and it calls for a more categorized research (by economic purpose) of cryptocurrencies whose potential intrinsic value would then be related to their economic purpose.","[Schinckus, Christophe] Univ Fraser Valley, Sch Business, Abbotsford, BC, Canada; [Canh Phuc Nguyen] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Sch Banking, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Chong, Felicia Hui Ling] Taylors Univ, Finance & Econ, Subang Jaya, Malaysia","","Schinckus, C (corresponding author), Taylors Univ, Finance & Econ, Subang Jaya, Malaysia.","christophe.schinckus@taylors.edu.my","Nguyen, Canh Phuc/AAG-8627-2019","Nguyen, Canh Phuc/0000-0001-8467-5010; Schinckus, Christophe/0000-0002-0977-7428","","","","","45","0","0","7","11","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1076-9307","1099-1158","","INT J FINANC ECON","Int.

In doing so, we apply a Time-Varying Parameter Vector Auto-Regression (TVP-VAR) model, a dynamic connectedness approach and network analysis. The empirical results indicate that cryptocurrency returns and monetary policy spillovers were particularly large when shadow policy rates became negative, moderated during the Fed's 'tapering process', and sharpened again more recently as cryptocurrency buoyancy returned. Gross directional spillovers suggest that shadow policy rates have more 'to give than to receive', while those from and to cryptocurrency returns are naturally volatile. There is also strong interconnectedness between monetary policy in either the US or the Eurozone and the UK, and between Bitcoin and Litecoin. However, the spillovers across monetary policy and cryptocurrencies tend to be muted. Finally, spillovers were only slightly larger during the Fed's 'unconventional' policy compared to the 'standard' era, but their composition qualitatively changed over time.","[Elsayed, Ahmed H.] Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Durham, England; [Elsayed, Ahmed H.] Zagazig Univ, Fac Commerce, Dept Econ, Zagazig, Egypt; [Sousa, Ricardo M.] Univ Minho, Dept Econ, Braga, Portugal; [Sousa, Ricardo M.] Univ Minho, Ctr Res Econ & Management NIPE, Braga, Portugal; [Sousa, Ricardo M.] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Alumni Assoc, London, England","","Elsayed, AH (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Durham, England.;Elsayed, AH (corresponding author), Zagazig Univ, Fac Commerce, Dept Econ, Zagazig, Egypt.","ahmed.elsayed@durham.ac.uk","","Elsayed, Ahmed/0000-0002-7506-5963","National Funds of the FCT -Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [UIDB/ECO/03182/2020]","National Funds of the FCT -Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology)","This work was supported by National Funds of the FCT -Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [Grant Number UIDB/ECO/03182/2020].","","101","1","1","5","5","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1351-847X","1466-4364","","EUR J FINANC","Eur.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the dynamic relationship between the cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin and Ethereum, and stock market indices of G7 and E7 countries to analyze the return and volatility spillover patterns among these markets by means of multivariate (MGARCH) approach. Design/methodology/approach Applying the newly developed VAR-GARCH-in mean framework with the BEKK representation, the empirical results reveal that there exists an evidence of mean and volatility spillover effects among Bitcoin and Ethereum as the proxies for the cryptocurrencies, and stock markets reviewed. Findings Interestingly, the direction of the return and volatility spillover effects is unidirectional in most E7 countries, but bidirectional relationship was found in most G7 countries. This can be explained as the presence of a strong return and volatility interaction among G7 stock markets and crypto market. Originality/value Overall, the results of this study are of particular interest for portfolio management since it provides insights for financial market participants to make better portfolio allocation decisions. It is also increasingly important to understand the volatility transmission mechanism across these markets to provide policymakers and regulatory bodies with guidance to eliminate the negative impact of cryptocurrency's volatility on the stability of financial markets.","[Aydogan, Berna; Vardar, Gulin] Izmir Univ Econ, Int Trade & Finance, Izmir, Turkey; [Tacoglu, Caner] Izmir Univ Econ, Ind Engn, Balcova, Turkey","","Aydogan, B (corresponding author), Izmir Univ Econ, Int Trade & Finance, Izmir, Turkey.","berna.okan@ieu.edu.tr","","","","","","","52","0","0","6","10","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1026-4116","2054-6246","","J ECONOM ADM SCI","J.

The recent development of Healthcare 4.0 using the Internet of Things (IoT) components and cloud computing to access medical operations remotely has gained the researcher's attention from a smart city perspective. Healthcare 4.0 mainly consisted of periodic medical data sensing, aggregation, data transmission, data sharing, and data storage. The sensitive and personal data of patients lead to several challenges while protecting it from hackers. Therefore storing, accessing, and sharing the patient medical information on the cloud needs security attention that data should not be compromised by the authorized user's components of E-healthcare systems. To achieve secure medical data storage, sharing, and accessing in cloud service provider, several cryptography algorithms are designed so far. However, such conventional solutions failed to achieve the trade-off between the requirements of EHR security solutions such as computational efficiency, service side verification, user side verifications, without the trusted third party, and strong security. Blockchain-based security solutions gained significant attention in the recent past due to the ability to provide strong security for data storage and sharing with the minimum computation efforts. The blockchain made focused on bitcoin technology among the researchers. Utilizing the blockchain which secure healthcare records management has been of recent interest. This paper presents the systematic study of modern blockchain-based solutions for securing medical data with or without cloud computing. We implement and evaluate the different methods using blockchain in this paper. According to the research studies, the research gaps, challenges, and future roadmap are the outcomes of this paper that boost emerging Healthcare 4.0 technology.","[Mahajan, Hemant B.] Godwit Technol, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Rashid, Ameer Sardar] Univ Sulaimani, Coll Adm & Econ, Business Informat Technol, Sulaimaniya, Iraq; [Junnarkar, Aparna A.; Deshpande, Sarita D.] PES Modern Coll Engn, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Uke, Nilesh] Trinity Acad Engn, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Futane, Pravin R.] Vishwakarma Inst Informat Technol VIIT, Pune, India; [Alkhayyat, Ahmed] Islamic Univ, Tech Engn Coll, Najaf, Iraq; [Alhayani, Bilal] Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Elect & Commun, Istanbul, Turkey","","Mahajan, HB (corresponding author), Godwit Technol, Pune, Maharashtra, India.","mahhemant@gmail.com; ameer.rashid@univsul.edu.iq; ahmedalkhayyat85@gmail.com; bilalalhayani1@gmail.com","alkhayyat, ahmed/B-6434-2018; Uke, Nilesh J/N-2382-2015; Mahajan, Hemant/AAP-2042-2020; Kwekha Rashid, Ameer Sardar/AAQ-9112-2021","alkhayyat, ahmed/0000-0002-1270-4713; Uke, Nilesh J/0000-0002-3281-5429; Mahajan, Hemant/0000-0001-6703-7711; Kwekha Rashid, Ameer Sardar/0000-0003-1422-1878; alkhayyat, ahmed/0000-0002-0962-3453","","","","","78","1","1","8","12","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","2190-5509","2190-5517","","APPL NANOSCI","Appl.

The comparison of the first half of 2019 (outside the pandemic of COVID-19) against the first semester of 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) was used to analyze the pandemic influence. We found two distinct behaviors: (i) in 2019, Bitcoin, as the primary capitalization bond, presented a more substantial transfer of information than the other cryptocurrencies toward Bitcoin -> Ripple (0.0541), followed by Litecoin -> Ripple (0.0522); (ii) in 2020, the most substantial transfers of information occurred from Ethereum to other cryptocurrencies (Litecoin, Bitcoin, and Ripple, in that order). In this period, the weakest transfers happened from Litecoin Ripple and in the opposite direction, with equal value (0.0104). Our results indicate that there was a change in the direction of the information flow between the investigated cryptocurrencies, where ETH became the dominant cryptocurrency during the period of turbulence caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","[Do Nascimento, Kerolly Kedma Felix; Dos Santos, Fabio Sandro; Jale, Jader Silva; Ferreira, Tiago A.

For this purpose, we use the VAR for VaR framework to capture the extreme dependence (tail risk). Moreover, we compute the Granger-causality in risk to study the impact of the Paris Agreement on these markets. We provide novel evidence of the relationship between the clean and oil markets. Notably, the results suggest that they are highly integrated in terms of risk spillover: their lagged returns, risks and extreme events influence both the VaRs of the clean energy sector and oil prices. Additionally, there is a symmetrical and an asymmetrical effect between returns and risks depending on market condition (downside/upside). The focus on the Paris Agreement demonstrates that this event is not neutral concerning the risk transmission. The effects of spillover from oil to clean energy are present before the agreement, while afterwards, we do not find evidence. Finally, the findings provide fresh insights into the relationship between clean energy and Bitcoin. The empirical analysis shows a significant spillover effect of extreme events between the two markets, suggesting a possible substitution effect.","[Angelini, Eliana] G dAnnunzio Univ Chieti Pescara, Dept Econ, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65127 Pescara, Italy; [Birindelli, Giuliana; Chiappini, Helen] G dAnnunzio Univ Chieti Pescara, Dept Management & Business Adm, Pescara, Italy; [Foglia, Matteo] Aldo Moro Univ Bari, Dept Econ Management & Business Law, Bari, Italy","","Chiappini, H (corresponding author), G dAnnunzio Univ Chieti Pescara, Dept Econ, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65127 Pescara, Italy.","helen.chiappini@unich.it","","","","","","","59","0","0","0","0","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","2043-0795","2043-0809","","J SUSTAIN FINANC INV","J.

Blockchain networks, and by extension cryptocurrencies, were created with the promise of giving that power to users. The most well-known example of a blockchain technology achieving such decentralization is Bitcoin, but its popularity has arguably been matched by an alternative-currency named Dogecoin. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, which have marketed themselves on differentiating technical features, Dogecoin's allure likely stems from its cultural roots as a meme. Where cryptocurrency is typically regarded as a difficult topic to grasp, the introduction of Doge's (2013) most popular meme, into the crypto-space increased crypto's accessibility to new participants. Consequently, Dogecoin exists in two economies: the financial economy and the cultural meme economy, with the latter having unprecedented tangible impacts on the former. Dogecoin's unique cultural significance provides an example of how blockchain can succeed in promoting alternative money systems. At its peak in 2021, Dogecoin achieved a market capitalization of $88 billion. Where analysis of the Dogecoin phenomenon is lacking in the current literature, we will fill that gap with a case study of Dogecoin. By studying Dogecoin as a combination of money and meme, we can further our understanding of how to better promote social finance initiatives through the virality of memes.","[Nani, Albi] Univ Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada","","Nani, A (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Fac Informat & Media Studies, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.","anani@uwo.ca","","Nani, Albi/0000-0001-8427-7004","","","","","60","1","1","8","8","SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","THOUSAND OAKS","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","1354-8565","1748-7382","","CONVERGENCE-US","Convergence","","","","","","","","","","","1.354856521107E+16","10.1177/13548565211070417","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/13548565211070417","","MAR 2022","18","Communication","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Communication","0D0XG","","hybrid","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000775726100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The temporary holding time of the current mined block provides a pool additional time to begin mining the next block early with MBTH attack. In this situation, the winning probability increases for the next block, but the pool may risk losing the mined block. One enhanced method to maintain the winning probability of the held block is to ensure the holding pool sends out the mined block once it receives the mined block message from the other pools with the MBTH-EF attack. The explored MBTH attacks differ from the existing selfish miner and pool attacks. The operations and effects of the MBTH-EF attack are different from stubborn mining strategies and a self-holding attack integrates selfish and stubborn mining attacks. We propose a mining competition solution that does not involve actual hash calculation. It entails using one stochastic target hash value for batch racing simulation to evaluate the holding threshold, holding periods, mining time, mining difficulty, pool sizes, and the rate of fork occurrences according to the operation data of the Bitcoin system. Accordingly, the dynamic time-by-time, block-by-block, and pool-by-pool simulations are adopted to study these attacks. We analyzed MBTH and MBTH-EF attacks as well as evaluated the effects of the win rate on when and how long a block is held. Because the periodic adjustment of mining difficulty reduces the holding effect, we further evaluated how an intermittent MBTH-EF (iMBTH-EF) attack model balance the average mining time and mining difficulty according to the mining difficulty adjustment of a stage. The effect of intermittent holding is examined on the mining game win rate for a long-term competition. We also identified suitable attack detection methods for the future work according to the simulation results.","[Wen, Yean-Fu; Huang, Chun-Yu] Natl Taipei Univ, Grad Inst Informat Management, New Taipei 237303, Taiwan","","Wen, YF (corresponding author), Natl Taipei Univ, Grad Inst Informat Management, New Taipei 237303, Taiwan.","yeanfu@mail.ntpu.edu.tw","","Wen, Yean-Fu/0000-0002-5441-1767","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan [107-2221-E-305-003-MY2]; University System of Taipei, Taiwan [USTP-NTUT-NTPU-111-02]","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); University System of Taipei, Taiwan","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan, under Grant 107-2221-E-305-003-MY2 and University System of Taipei, Taiwan, under Grant USTP-NTUT-NTPU-111-02.","","40","1","1","2","2","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","61159","61174","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3181186","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3181186","","","16","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","2D4WI","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000811549000001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Then it conducts a critical examination of two major cases: the Building Blocks initiative by the World Food Programme in Jordan and the Rohingya Project. We find that blockchain can be useful in empowering vulnerable individuals, but the empowerment of organizations creates potential human rights risks, such as the infringement of privacy and discrimination. Therefore, adequate safeguards should be in place to ensure that blockchain initiatives meet their true purposes of protecting the most vulnerable groups.","[Connolly, Daniel] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Div Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Nam, Seunghyun] Korea Natl Diplomat Acad, Seoul 130791, South Korea; [Goodman, Kirsty] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea","","Nam, S (corresponding author), Korea Natl Diplomat Acad, Seoul 130791, South Korea.","dan-ielc@hufs.ac.kr; shynam21@mofa.go.kr; kirsty.goodman.20@ucl.ac.uk","","","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A3A2925085]","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2016S1A3A2925085).","","146","0","0","2","2","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1475-4835","1475-4843","","J HUM RIGHTS","J.

Besides, we investigate whether the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in an already diversified portfolio leads to additional economic gains. The main empirical results suggest that cryptocurrencies are not systematically predicted by stock market factors, precious metal commodities or supply factors. On the contrary, they display a time-varying but significant exposure to investors' attention. In addition, also because of a lack of predictability compared to traditional asset classes, cryptocurrencies lead to realized expected utility gains for a power utility investor.","[Bianchi, Daniele] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England; [Guidolin, Massimo] Univ Bocconi, Dept Finance, Milan, Italy; [Guidolin, Massimo; Pedio, Manuela] Baffi CAREFIN, Milan, Italy; [Pedio, Manuela] Univ Bristol, Sch Accounting & Finance, Bristol, Avon, England","","Bianchi, D (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England.","d.bianchi@qmul.ac.uk","","PEDIO, MANUELA/0000-0001-9521-0016; Bianchi, Daniele/0000-0002-2321-2108","","","","","48","0","0","4","4","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1351-847X","1466-4364","","EUR J FINANC","Eur.

Our model also allows us to assess the impact of co-jumps. Using high-frequency data to compute the daily realized volatility, we show that downside, upside, and small jumps observed in cryptocurrencies negatively affect the jump component of other cryptocurrencies' realized volatility, while large jumps have the opposite effect. We further find significant asymmetric effects between small and large as well as between downside and upside jumps for several cryptocurrencies. Moreover, we find evidence of co-jumping behavior, which can trigger future jumps. The practical implications of our findings are also discussed.

We document evidence consistent with heightened activity in coin wallets belonging to unregulated exchanges and mixer services-central to laundering funds between terrorist groups and operatives on the ground. Next, we use forensic accounting techniques to follow the trails of funds associated with the Sri Lanka Easter bombing. Insights from this event corroborate our findings and aid in our construction of a blockchain-based predictive model. Finally, using machine-learning algorithms, we demonstrate that fund trails have predictive power in out-of-sample analysis.

The study captures the financial behavior of investors during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of national lockdowns and slowdown of production. Three different methods, namely, EGARCH, DCC-GARCH, and wavelet, are used to understand whether cryptocurrency markets have been exposed to extreme volatility. While GARCH family models provide information about asset returns at given time scales, wavelets capture that information across different frequencies without losing inputs from the time horizon. The overall results show that three cryptocurrency markets (i.e., Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin) are highly volatile and mutually dependent over the sample period. This result means that any kind of shock in one market leads investors to act in the same direction in the other market and thus indirectly causes volatility spillovers in those markets. The results also imply that the volatility spillover across cryptocurrency markets was more influential in the second lockdown that started at the beginning of November 2020. Finally, to calculate the financial risk, two methods-namely, value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)-are used, along with two additional stock indices (the Shanghai Composite Index and S&P 500). Regardless of the confidence level investigated, the selected crypto assets, with the exception of the USDT were found to have substantially greater downside risk than SSE and S&P 500.","[Ozdemir, Onur] Istanbul Gelisim Univ, Dept Int Trade & Finance English, Istanbul, Turkey","","Ozdemir, O (corresponding author), Istanbul Gelisim Univ, Dept Int Trade & Finance English, Istanbul, Turkey.","onozdemir@gelisim.edu.tr","Özdemir, Onur/AGR-7172-2022","Ozdemir, Onur/0000-0002-3804-0062","","","","","100","2","2","20","32","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","2199-4730","","FINANC INNOV","Financ.

However, in recent years, the use of blockchain has expanded to a wide range of networks and application domains. This includes time-sensitive applications which need transactions to be processed fast enough to meet delay requirements. Reducing the transaction waiting time in the mining process is key to the successful adoption of blockchain in such applications. In this paper, we propose a mining strategy that is aimed at minimizing the average waiting time per transaction by ensuring a certain minimum required block size, based on the average transaction arrival rate, mining service rate, and maximum block size. We derive an expression for the average transaction waiting time of the proposed mining strategy and determine the optimal mining rule. Numerical results show that the average waiting time per transaction can be reduced by up to 15% using the proposed mining strategy compared to the traditional strategy in which miners immediately start the next mining round using the transactions already waiting in the pool.","[Ramezan, Gholamreza; Leung, Cyril] Univ British Columbia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Miao, Chunyan] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Singapore, Singapore","","Ramezan, G (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Vancouver, BC, Canada.","gramezan@ece.ubc.ca","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada [RGPIN-2020-05410]; UBC PMC-Sierra Professorship in Networking and Communications","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); UBC PMC-Sierra Professorship in Networking and Communications","This work was supported in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada under Grant RGPIN-2020-05410 and by the UBC PMC-Sierra Professorship in Networking and Communications.","","21","0","0","1","1","WILEY-HINDAWI","LONDON","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND","1530-8669","1530-8677","","WIREL COMMUN MOB COM","Wirel.

Altogether, the empirical and theoretical results suggest that households view Crypto as a pseudo productive/long-term asset class, and not speculative.","[Bonaparte, Yosef] Univ Colorado Denver, 1475 Lawrence St, Denver, CO 80202 USA","","Bonaparte, Y (corresponding author), Univ Colorado Denver, 1475 Lawrence St, Denver, CO 80202 USA.","yosef.bonaparte@ucdenver.edu","","","","","","","47","0","0","4","4","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1042-4431","1873-0612","","J INT FINANC MARK I","J.

Findings from the study divulge that the variational mode functions at the lower quantiles are mostly significant and negative indicating that gold acts as a safe haven, a diversifier at most market conditions with insignificant coefficients, and a hedge at normal market conditions for most cryptocurrencies at various investment horizons. Particularly, hedging benefits mostly occur in the short- and medium-term for Bitcoin and Ripple, as well as Bitcoin and Dogecoin in the long-term with gold. This implies that there is high persistence in the hedging properties of gold with Bitcoin, followed by Ripple. We notice more significant relationship between gold and some cryptocurrencies in the long-term of the COVID-19 pandemic relative to the medium-term emphasising the delayed responses of prices to information.

We present a comprehensive analysis of the predictability of price movements comparing four different deep learning algorithms (Multi Layers Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and Attention Long Short Term Memory (ALSTM)). We use three classes of features, considering a combination of technical (e.g. opening and closing prices), trading (e.g. moving averages) and social (e.g. users' sentiment) indicators as input to our classification algorithm. We compare a restricted model composed of technical indicators only, and an unrestricted model including technical, trading and social media indicators. We found an increase in accuracy for the daily classification task from a range of 51%-55% for the restricted model to 67%-84% for the unrestricted one.

This paper considers a proxy of cryptos, specifically Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple & Neo, and the Middle East stock market indices, to examine the dynamic relationship among them using the vector error correction model. This study found evidence to suggest that cryptos exhibit a co-integrated relationship while there is no evidence of significant cointegrated movements occurring between the cryptos and the market indices. The latter finding implies that cryptos are decoupled from the market indices and can serve as a diversification option for investors. The mean-variance approach confirms that cryptocurrencies fit into an optimal portfolio and involve an enhanced return-risk reward for investors.","[Kumaran, Sunitha] Dar Al Uloom Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance & Banking, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","","Kumaran, S (corresponding author), Dar Al Uloom Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance & Banking, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","sunithakravi@rediffmail.com","","","","","","","47","0","0","11","11","INVESTMENT ANALYSTS SOC SOUTHERN AFRICA","FERNDALE","PO BOX 131, FERNDALE, 2160, SOUTH AFRICA","1029-3523","2077-0227","","INVEST ANAL J","Invest.

Moreover, digital transformations led to the development of cryptocurrency. However, crypto trading provokes a dilemma loop. On the one hand, crypto trading led to economic development, which allowed attracting additional resources to extending smart and green technologies for de-carbonising the economic growth. On the other hand, crypto trading led to intensifying energy sources, which provoked an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation. The paper aims to analyse the connections between crypto trading, economic development of the country, renewable energy consumption, and environmental degradation. The data for analysis were obtained from: Our World in Data, World Data Bank, Eurostat, Ukrstat, Crystal Blockchain, and KOF Globalisation Index. To check the hypothesis, the paper applied the Pedroni and Kao panel cointegration tests, FMOLS and DOLS panel cointegration models, and Vector Error Correction Models. The findings concluded that the increasing crypto trading led to enhanced GDP, real gross fixed capital formation, and globalisation. However, in the long run, the relationship between crypto trading and the share of renewable energies in total energy consumption was not confirmed by the empirical results. For further directions, it is necessary to analyse the impact of crypto trading on land and water pollution.","[Miskiewicz, Radoslaw] Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ Finance & Management, PL-70453 Szczecin, Poland; [Matan, Krzysztof] Luma Holding, St Julian 4010, Malta; [Karnowski, Jakub] Warsaw Sch Econ, Liberal Econ Unit, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland","","Miskiewicz, R (corresponding author), Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ Finance & Management, PL-70453 Szczecin, Poland.","radoslaw.miskiewicz@usz.edu.pl; krzysztof.matan@lumaholding.eu; kubakarn@sgh.waw.pl","Miskiewicz, Radoslaw/S-8344-2018","Miskiewicz, Radoslaw/0000-0003-2370-4783; Matan, Krzysztof/0000-0002-6952-529X","","","","","100","0","0","7","7","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1996-1073","","ENERGIES","Energies","MAY","2022","15","10","","","","","","","3805","10.3390/en15103805","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15103805","","","15","Energy & Fuels","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Energy & Fuels","1O9PR","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000801654900001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In addition, precious metal prices, energy prices, and cryptocurrency prices are used as control variables. To do so, we investigate the impact of EPU, gold prices, oil prices, and Bitcoin prices on stock market returns by using the panel autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to examine both the long-run correlation and short-run effect. Our findings show that EPU, gold prices, oil prices, and Bitcoin prices have a time-varying significant impact on sustainable stock market returns. We discovered that EPU has a significantly negative impact on the returns of the sustainable stocks in the markets over the long run. In contrast, the rise of the gold price, oil price, and Bitcoin price have a significantly positive impact on the returns of the sustainable stocks in the twelve sustainable markets in the long run. On the other hand, EPU in Singapore, Spain, the Netherlands, and Russia has a significant short-run impact on market returns in each country. Based on the findings, managers and investors in the sustainable stock markets are highly recommended to pay more attention to the volatility of EPU, gold prices, oil prices, and Bitcoin prices in the short run to control the risk of returns in the sustainable stock market. Furthermore, policymakers must closely monitor the movement of the EPU index, as it is a major driver of sustainable stock market returns.","[Darsono, Susilo Nur Aji Cokro; Nguyen, Tran Thai Ha] Asia Univ, Coll Management, Dept Business Adm, Taichung 41354, Taiwan; [Darsono, Susilo Nur Aji Cokro; Wardani, Dyah Titis Kusuma] Univ Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Yogyakarta 55183, Indonesia; [Wong, Wing-Keung] Asia Univ, Dept Finance, Fintech & Blockchain Res Ctr, Taichung 41354, Taiwan; [Wong, Wing-Keung] Asia Univ, Big Data Res Ctr, Taichung 41354, Taiwan; [Wong, Wing-Keung] China Med Univ Hosp, Dept Med Res, Taichung 41354, Taiwan; [Wong, Wing-Keung] Hang Seng Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Shatin 999077, Peoples R China; [Nguyen, Tran Thai Ha] Saigon Univ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Ho Chi Minh City 756100, Vietnam","","Darsono, SNAC (corresponding author), Asia Univ, Coll Management, Dept Business Adm, Taichung 41354, Taiwan.;Darsono, SNAC (corresponding author), Univ Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Yogyakarta 55183, Indonesia.","susilonuraji@umy.ac.id; wong@asia.edu.tw; nguyen.tranthaiha@sgu.edu.vn; dyah.wardani@umy.ac.id","Darsono, Susilo Nur Aji Cokro/ABF-4788-2020","Darsono, Susilo Nur Aji Cokro/0000-0003-1715-4148; Wong, Wing-Keung/0000-0001-6755-572X; Tran Thai Ha, Nguyen/0000-0003-2598-3720","Asia University; Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta; China Medical University Hospital; Hang Seng University of Hong Kong; Saigon University; Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta [550/PEN-LP3M/II/2020]; Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong [12500915]; Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan [106-2410-H-468-002, 107-2410-H-468-002-MY3]","Asia University; Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta; China Medical University Hospital; Hang Seng University of Hong Kong; Saigon University; Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta; Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This research has been supported by Asia University, Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta, China Medical University Hospital, The Hang Seng University of Hong Kong, Saigon University.

This paper investigated the forecasting capability of the Transformer model on Bitcoin (BTC) price data and Ethereum (ETH) price data which are time series with high fluctuation. Long short term memory model (LSTM) is employed for performance comparison. The result shows that LSTM performs better than Transformer both on BTC and ETH price prediction. Furthermore, in this paper, we also investigated if sentiment analysis can help improve the model's performance in forecasting future prices. Twitter data and Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) is used for getting sentiment scores. The result shows that the sentiment analysis improves the Transformer model's performance on BTC price but not ETH price. For the LSTM model, the sentiment analysis does not help with prediction results.

The biggest shortcoming of the state-of-the-art redactable blockchain protocols is that they fail to consider the appearance of multiple conflicting redactions at the same time. When the protocol faces multiple conflicting requests for a specific block submitted almost simultaneously, their method will lead to conflicts. We put forward a redactable blockchain protocol that packages requests into a conflict-free set for vote-based consensus to eliminate the possibility of two different edited versions of the chain and ensure the consistency of the system. Moreover, our protocol, unbinding the redaction processing from the extension of the blockchain, can be easily integrable in blockchain systems based on proof of work and proof of stake. Furthermore, our protocol, resisting against a fully adaptive adversary, confirms the edited blocks at a constant rate.","[Meng, Xianning; Li, Hongda; Xu, Haixian] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Sch Cyber Secur, Inst Informat Engn, State Key Lab Informat Secur, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ni, Peifang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Software, Trusted Comp & Informat Assurance Lab, Beijing, Peoples R China","","Meng, XN (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Sch Cyber Secur, Inst Informat Engn, State Key Lab Informat Secur, Beijing, Peoples R China.","mengxianning@iie.ac.cn; peifang2020@iscas.ac.cn; lihongda@iie.ac.cn; xuhaixia@iie.ac.cn","","","","","","","15","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-1647-4","","","","2022","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/PerComWorkshops53856.2022.9767382","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PerComWorkshops53856.2022.9767382","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BT3OS","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000821801200072","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We conclude that, rather than platform valuation, investor attention is a dominant driver of DeFi prices, with DeFi being a separate asset class from mainstream cryptocurrencies.","[Corbet, Shaen] Dublin City Univ, DCU Business Sch, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Corbet, Shaen] Univ Waikato, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Goodell, John W.] Univ Akron, Akron, OH 44325 USA; [Gunay, Samet] Amer Univ Middle East AUM, Egaila, Kuwait","","Corbet, S (corresponding author), Dublin City Univ, DCU Business Sch, Dublin 9, Ireland.","shaen.corbet@dcu.ie","Corbet, Shaen/B-4869-2017","Corbet, Shaen/0000-0001-7430-7417; Goodell, John W./0000-0003-4126-9244","","","","","27","1","1","13","13","ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE","SAN DIEGO","525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","1544-6123","1544-6131","","FINANC RES LETT","Financ.

As of September 2021, the storage size of the Bitcoin blockchain has expanded to 355 GB, and it has increased by approximately 50 GB every year over the last five years. This storage requirement is a major hurdle to becoming a block proposer or validator. We propose an architecture called Trail that allows nodes to hold all blocks in a small storage and to generate and validate blocks and transactions. A node in Trail holds all blocks without transactions, UTXOs or account balances. The block size is approximately 8 kB, which is 100 times smaller than that of Bitcoin. On the other hand, a client who issues transactions needs to hold proof of its assets. Thus, compared to traditional blockchains, clients must store additional data. We show that proper data archiving can keep the account device storage size small. Then, we propose a method of executing smart contracts in Trail using a threshold signature. Trail allows more users to be block proposers and validators and improves the decentralization and security of the blockchain.","[Nagayama, Ryunosuke; Banno, Ryohei; Shudo, Kazuyuki] Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Comp, Tokyo 1528552, Japan; [Nagayama, Ryunosuke] Yahoo Japan Corp, Tokyo, Japan; [Banno, Ryohei] Kogakuin Univ, Tokyo, Japan","","Shudo, K (corresponding author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Comp, Tokyo 1528552, Japan.","shudo@is.titech.ac.jp","","","SECOM Science and Technolgy Foundation; JSPS KAKENHI [JP21H04872]","SECOM Science and Technolgy Foundation; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Ryunosuke Nagayama and Kazuyuki Shudo were supported by SECOM Science and Technolgy Foundation.

It indicated that cryptocurrency market returns would be volatile, connected with the time-varying pattern. Most ARCH and GARCH effects were significant in estimating the three pairs of returnmining profitability, return-Tweet, and mining profitability-Tweet. For the cryptocurrency return and profitability pair, returns depended on future price returns and cross-volatility spillover and were greater than their own volatility spillover effect. Moreover, the BEKK diagonal model was found to be the best model for return-mining profitability.

Specifically, we present two new heuristics, one to identify Bisq trades on the Bitcoin blockchain and another to cluster the addresses used in those trades. We demonstrate that these heuristics are effective in identifying the trading activity of Bisq users and aggregating their trading activity across multiple trades.

Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, the first notorious blockchain system bound to a cryptocurrency, the blockchain ecosystem has experienced a huge growth, driven by innovations both in conceptual and algorithmic terms, and in the creation of a large number of new cryptocoins. New blockchains and their associated cryptocoins, emerge mostly as the result of forking already existing projects. Here, we show that the appearance of new cryptocoins can be well described by a sub-linear power-law (Heaps' law) of the total crypto-market capitalization. At the same time, we propose a model that well reproduces the evolution of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Our model suggests that each cryptocurrency triggers, on average, the creation of ca. 1.58 novel cryptocoins, a result confirmed by the analysis of the Bitcoin historical forking tree. Moreover, we deduce that the largest cryptocurrency, nowadays Bitcoin, will comprise around the 50% of the whole crypto-market and that this fraction is going to stabilize in the near future, provided that the present fundamental macro-economic conditions do not change radically.","[De Marzo, Giordano] Ctr Ric Enrico Fermi, Piazza Viminale 1, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [De Marzo, Giordano; Pandolfelli, Francesco] Univ Sapienza, Dipartimento Fis, Ple A Moro 2, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [De Marzo, Giordano] Sapienza Sch Adv Studies, Ple A Moro 2, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [De Marzo, Giordano; Servedio, Vito D.

Can blockchain innovation promote total factor productivity? Based on the blockchain patent data of Chinese-listed firms from 2012 to 2020, we show that blockchain innovation activities can improve the total factor productivity (TFP) of enterprises and verify its robustness using instrumental variable approach, system GMM and Heckman's two-step selection method. Results of mediation effect model show that enterprises' blockchain innovation activities mainly improve TFP through three channels: alleviating financing constraints, reducing supply chain concentration and inefficient investment. Heterogeneity analysis shows that electronic digital data processing blockchain patents have the highest practical value, while financial blockchain innovation inhibits the improvement of TFP in China. Blockchain innovation can bring positive effects on the TFP of manufacturing enterprises and leasing and business service enterprises. The increase in TFP of leasing and business service enterprises brought by blockchain innovation is nearly 70 times that of the baseline regression. We further provide blockchain innovation development suggestions for Chinese government based on these conclusions.","[Xu, Ruifeng; Guan, E.] Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Room 1902,Bldg 64, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China","","Guan, E (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Room 1902,Bldg 64, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.","e_guan@whu.edu.cn","xu, rui/GRX-5734-2022","","National Social Science Fund of China [20ZD072]","National Social Science Fund of China","The work was supported in part by The National Social Science Fund of China [Grant number 20&ZD072].","","49","0","0","20","20","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0003-6846","1466-4283","","APPL ECON","Appl.

Specifically, the anti-persistence multifractal of the price-volume cross-correlation is significantly stronger in the upward market than in the downward market for Bitcoin and Ethereum; for the remaining four cryptocurrencies, the opposite result is obtained. Furthermore, Dogecoin price-volume cross-correlation exhibits the most marked anti-persistence and the most significant asymmetric multifractality among the six cryptocurrencies analyzed.","[Yan, Yan; Wang, Jian] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Math & Stat, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Shao, Wei] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China","","Wang, J (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Math & Stat, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.","yy0061220@163.com; shaowei0511@163.com; 003328@nuist.edu.cn","","","Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST","Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST","This work was supported by the Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST.","","35","0","0","8","8","WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD","SINGAPORE","5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE","0219-4775","1793-6780","","FLUCT NOISE LETT","Fluct.

It can be argued that digital payment is helpful in supply chain management applications. However, the adoption of CBDC in the supply chain could bring new turbulence since the CBDC value may fluctuate. Therefore, this paper intends to optimize the production plan of manufacturing supply chain based on a volatility clustering model by reducing CBDC value uncertainty. We apply both GARCH model and machine learning model to depict the CBDC volatility clustering. Empirically, we employed Baltic Dry Index, Bitcoin and exchange rate as main variables with sample period from 2015 to 2021 to evaluate the performance of the two models. On this basis, we reveal that our machine learning model overwhelmingly outperforms the GARCH model. Consequently, our result implies that manufacturing companies' performance can be strengthened through CBDC uncertainty reduction.","[Ding, Shusheng; Wu, Xiangling] Ningbo Univ, Sch Business, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Cui, Tianxiang] Univ Nottingham Ningbo China, Sch Comp Sci, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Du, Min] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Business Sch, Edinburgh, Scotland","","Du, M (corresponding author), Edinburgh Napier Univ, Business Sch, Edinburgh, Scotland.","dingshusheng@nbu.edu.cn; tianxiang.cui@nottingham.edu.cn; wuxiangling@nbu.edu.cn; a.du@napier.ac.uk","","Du, Min (Anna)/0000-0002-1715-8774","Academy of Longyuan Construction Financial Research Grant [LYZDB2004]; International Research Center for Sustainable Finance","Academy of Longyuan Construction Financial Research Grant; International Research Center for Sustainable Finance","This paper is supported by the Academy of Longyuan Construction Financial Research Grant (Grant Number: LYZDB2004) and is also supported by International Research Center for Sustainable Finance.","","56","0","0","14","14","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0275-5319","1878-3384","","RES INT BUS FINANC","Res.

As a result, the wavelet techniques-bi-wavelet, partial wavelet, bivariate contemporary correlations (BCC), wavelet multiple correlations (WMC) and wavelet multiple cross-correlations (WMCC) are applied. Findings from the study provide that the interdependencies between the cryptocurrencies and VCRIX are high and mostly positive across investment horizons. Furthermore, the comovements between the cryptocurrencies designate long memory dynamics. The high comovements between cryptocurrencies are highly influenced by idiosyncratic shocks they possess rather than the VCRIX. In addition, the BCC and the WMC indicate that there is a high integration among all the cryptocurrencies. Categorically, the VCRIX could not lead or lag the interdependencies among the cryptocurrencies in the WMCC analysis. Findings from the study, therefore, divulge that investing in a single or few cryptocurrencies is highly risky due to the adverse impact of the VCRIX on individual cryptocurrencies. In general, investors should effectively hedge against volatilities in the cryptocurrency markets due to the significant predictive ability of VCRIX as an effective proxy.","[Agyei, Samuel Kwaku; Adam, Anokye Mohammed; Bossman, Ahmed; Owusu, Peterson, Jr.; Asafo-Adjei, Emmanuel] Univ Cape Coast, Sch Business, Dept Finance, Cape Coast, Ghana; [Asiamah, Oliver] Univ Limoges, Lab Anal & Prospect Econom, Limoges, France; [Asafo-Adjei, Roberta] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Business Sch, Dept Accounting & Finance, Kumasi, Ghana","","Asafo-Adjei, E (corresponding author), Univ Cape Coast, Sch Business, Dept Finance, Cape Coast, Ghana.","eaadjei12998@gmail.com","Asiamah, Oliver/GPP-3367-2022; Owusu Junior, Peterson/GPX-9651-2022; Asafo-Adjei, Emmanuel/AAB-1204-2021; Bossman, Ahmed/GOJ-9241-2022","Asiamah, Oliver/0000-0003-1304-4873; Owusu Junior, Peterson/0000-0001-6253-5770; Asafo-Adjei, Emmanuel/0000-0002-4449-6285; Bossman, Ahmed/0000-0001-9539-0889; Agyei, Samuel Kwaku/0000-0002-8167-7747","","","","","79","7","7","8","8","TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS","OSLO","KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY","2332-2039","","","COGENT ECON FINANC","Cogent Econ.

We applied quantile regression (QR) and quantile-in-quantile Regression (QQR) on the decomposed series to capture the bear (bull) market conditions. Applying the QR, we found Ethereum, Steller, Ripple and Monero as hedges for oil market volatility at all market regimes from medium to long terms. The QR undermined the hedging properties of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Das, suggesting possible spread of market disruptions from these markets to crude oil market. We observe from QQR that the assets have negative influence on each other at bear market but positive influence at bull market across time, signifying hedging possibilities for both assets in bear market.

Its integrated mining technology lies the key security mechanism. The system allows forming a pool mining group to solve a particular job and share their revenues to their CPU usage while one of them successfully mines a block. To mine a block, a cryptographic puzzle should be solved, which requires significant compute resources that cause huge energy consumption. On the other hand, recent statistics show that low computational energy-restricted Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasing exponentially. Although it has low energy and limited computation power, it is large in quantity when it is integrated. So we focus on a stochastic geometry theory, which resolves the issue of block mining computation via utilizing multiple mobile IoT devices, given that these IoT devices are Computation Capable Nodes (CCNs). To further normalize this issue, we propose an efficient mathematical solution that uses smart coordination of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) for IoT devices to enable their CPU usage efficiently. At the same time, the work and credit point distribution policy is smartly handled through virtual pool mining. The proposal renders Network Function Virtualization technology to configure VNF, and Service Function Chain technology is utilized to enable the network flow of such VNFs. New algorithms are presented to solve multiple issues like node discovery, computation offloading, and work credit point distribution. Our goal is to minimize energy consumption within the given time constraint. Implementation results show that although virtual functions for block mining require extensive computations in IoT devices, dividing computation work into small fractions called tasks embedded with VNF, and offloading them to nearby CCNs, tend to minimize the cost and energy consumption of individual shared miners. The overall mining process is proved efficient and faster.","[Wang, Jun] China Elect Technol Grp Corp, Res Inst 30, Beijing 100846, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jiang] Jose Rizal Univ, Grad Sch, Mandaluyong City, Philippines; [Zhang, Minghui] Guangdong Innovat Tech Coll, Sch Informat Engn, Dongguan 523960, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Alam, Iqbal] Nan Yang Acad Sci NASS, Beijing 102400, Peoples R China; [Biswas, Sujit] Univ Surrey, Elect & Elect Engn Dept, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Biswas, Sujit] Univ Dhaka, Comp Sci & Engn Dept, Faridpur Engn Coll, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh","","Zhu, J (corresponding author), Jose Rizal Univ, Grad Sch, Mandaluyong City, Philippines.","jiangzhujohn@qq.com","","Alam, Iqbal/0000-0003-0361-481X","","","","","48","0","0","7","7","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","59862","59877","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3176349","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3176349","","","16","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","2A3FL","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000809391200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

An efficient consensus algorithm is inclusive that engages all the participants to make their decision based on the conflicts of the blockchain networks. These consensus decisions lead to better quality outcomes of the blockchains and help to obtain the finality. Rigorous research is in process to upgrade or optimize the existing consensus protocols. The optimized or enhanced consensus protocols objectify to be suitable for Internet-of Thing (IoT) as the current versions of the protocols are not suitable for the resource-constrained environments due their complexity, hard configurations, mining techniques, high resource consumption, and explicit security loophole. In this paper, we present a survey of consensus protocols with a purpose to identify and discuss the existence of various consensus protocols available in literature. We emphasize on the genesis of the consensus protocols, particularly for Proof-of-X, byzantine fault tolerance, Paxos, and RAFT; we also include Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) orientation of some contemporary algorithms. We discuss the variants of these genesis protocols. Our survey analyzes the advantages, disadvantages, and their applicability in IoTs. We enlist the categorical use of consensus algorithms in blockchains and other applications. Finally, we present several research trends and open issues emphasizing for consensus protocols emphasizing on IoTs. Compared to the other surveys in the field, our present survey objectifies to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues; this survey helps the researchers and the application developers to obtain an insight on the current status of the consensus protocols' suitability to deliver the desired functionalities in IoTs.

The main body of this research aims at both studying the extent of its impact and defending against it. Yet, before any practical defense is deployed in a real world blockchain system, it needs to be tested for security and dependability. However, real blockchain systems are too complex to conduct any test on or benchmark the developed protocols. Instead, some simulation environments have been proposed recently, such as BlockSim (Maher et al., SIGMETRICS Perform. Eval. Rev. '19), which is a modular and easy-to-use blockchain simulator. However, BlockSim's structure is insufficient to capture the essence of a real blockchain network, as the simulation of an entire network happens over a single CPU. Such a lack of decentralization can cause network issues such as propagation delays being simulated in an unrealistic manner. In this work, we propose BlockSim-Net, a modular, efficient, high performance, distributed, network-based blockchain simulator that is parallelized to better reflect reality in a blockchain simulation environment.","[Ramachandran, Prashanthi; Agrawal, Nandini] Ashoka Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Sonipat, India; [Bicer, Osman; Kupcu, Alptekin] Koc Univ, Comp Engn, Istanbul, Turkey","","Ramachandran, P (corresponding author), Ashoka Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Sonipat, India.","","Küpçü, Alptekin/A-2224-2013","Küpçü, Alptekin/0000-0003-2099-2206","TUBITAK, the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey [119E088]","TUBITAK, the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK))","We acknowledge support from TUBITAK, the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey, under project number 119E088.","","17","0","0","1","2","TUBITAK SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL TURKEY","ANKARA","ATATURK BULVARI NO 221, KAVAKLIDERE, ANKARA, 00000, TURKEY","1300-0632","1303-6203","","TURK J ELECTR ENG CO","Turk.

Our results indicate a change in the long-range dependence for the majority of cryptocurrencies, with a noticeable downward trend in persistence after the 2017 bubble and then a dramatic drop after the outbreak of COVID-19.

The statistical test first estimates the cryptocurrencies' volatilities as a function of the price level. Then, these estimates are extrapolated over the positive real line using power functions. Finally, these power functions underly a sequence of hypothesis tests for price bubbles that control for both Type I and Type II errors. Five of the eight currencies (BTC, BCH, EOS, XMR, ZEC) exhibit price bubbles, LTC does not, and the evidence for ETH and XRP is inconclusive.

In this study, the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the return-volatility and return-volume relationships for the ten most traded cryptocurrencies, namely Tether, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Chainlink, Cardano, and Monero is examined. Fur-ther, the behavior of cryptocurrencies during COVID-19 pandemic is compared with less volatile markets such as Gold, WTI, and BRENT crude oil markets. To study the effect of volatility on cryptocurrency return, an EGARCH-M model is employed while for the return-volume relationships the VAR model and Granger causality tests are uti-lized. Results show that the return-volatility relationships for Tether, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, and Monero are significant during COVID-19 pandemic, while the same relationship is not significant prior to the pandemic for any of the studied cryptocurrencies. Our findings of the return-volume relationship support the availability of causal relations from return to trading volume changes for Chainlink and Monero in the pre-COVID-19 period and for Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, EOS, and Cardano during the COVID-19 period. However, considering the absolute values of returns, we found a significant relationship from cryptocurrencies' absolute returns to trading volume changes for both the prior and during COVID-19 periods. From a managerial perspec-tive, gold can be considered a suitable asset for portfolio hedging during the pandemic period and trading volume can help traders and investors identify the effect of momentum and potential trend in cryptocurrencies on their investments.","[Foroutan, Parisa; Lahmiri, Salim] Concordia Univ, Dept Supply Chain & Business Technol Management, Montreal, PQ, Canada","","Lahmiri, S (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Supply Chain & Business Technol Management, Montreal, PQ, Canada.","parisa.foroutan@concordia.ca; salim.lahmiri@concordia.ca","","","Chaire Fintech AMF-Finance Montr?al, Canada [0007]","Chaire Fintech AMF-Finance Montr?al, Canada","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Chaire Fintech AMF-Finance Montr?al, Canada.

Its links and interactions with all of the country's relevant enterprises enable it to benefit from every part of the country. When gauging the social and economic well-being of a country, an agricultural base must be substantial. Agriculture is by far the main source of employment in most countries. It has many components, including supply chain management, crop insurance, and shipping of goods, which requires numerous unverified parties, such as farmers, retailers, customers, and wholesalers (assessor, surveyors). A case could be made that due to the presence of a middle man (i.e. human beings or human-operated agencies) crucial issues such as accessibility, expediency, security, and immutability have been raised. As a result, financial loss, crop contamination, and waste have occurred. Blockchain, the technology behind the digital currency bitcoin, is a decentralized shareholding ledger that collects data from multiple parties involved in the Bitcoin network transactions. For this reason, the Bitcoin network relies on the Blockchain to keep track of transaction history and other transaction-related information, such as the transaction's completion, the addresses of the sender(s) and the recipient(s), and information about whether the transaction was successful. Donors can be confident that the money will be given to only one organization. To keep information private, every piece of data is encrypted on the Blockchain. This article describes a blockchain-based agriculture infrastructure in which data regarding farmers and farming is safely and securely recorded. Copyright (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

This field is advancing at a remarkable speed. Since the inception of its initial application, blockchain has come a long way. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency based on blockchain, also known as distributed ledger technology (DLT). The most well-known cryptocurrency for everyday use is Bitcoin, which debuted in 2008. Its success ushered in a digital revolution, and it currently provides security, decentralization, and a reliable data transport and storage mechanism to various industries and companies. Governments and developing enterprises seeking a competitive edge have expressed interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to the rapid growth of this recent technology. For computer experts and individuals looking for a method to supplement their income, cryptocurrency mining has become a big source of anxiety. Mining is a way of resolving mathematical problems based on the processing capacity and speed of the computers employed to solve them in return for the digital currency incentives. Herein, we have illustrated benefits of utilizing GPUs (graphical processing units) for cryptocurrency mining and compare two methods, namely overclocking and undervolting, which are the superior techniques when it comes to GPU optimization. The techniques we have used in this paper will not only help the miners to gain profits while mining cryptocurrency but also solve a major flaw; in order to mitigate the energy and resources that are consumed by the mining hardware, we have designed the mining hardware to simultaneously run longer and consume much less electricity. We have also compared our techniques with other popular techniques that are already in existence with respect to GPU mining.","[Shuaib, Mohammed] Jazan Univ, Coll Comp Sci & IT, Dept Comp Sci, Jazan 45142, Saudi Arabia; [Badotra, Sumit; Gundaboina, Lokesh] Lovely Profess Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Phagwara 144411, Punjab, India; [Khalid, Muhammad Irfan] Univ Salerno, Dept Informat & Elect Engn & Appl Math, I-84084 Fisciano, Italy; [Algarni, Abeer D.] Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Dept Informat Technol, Box 84428, Riyadh 11671, Saudi Arabia; [Ullah, Syed Sajid] Univ Agder UiA, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, N-4898 Grimstad, Norway; [Bourouis, Sami] Taif Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Technol, POB 11099, Taif 21944, Saudi Arabia; [Iqbal, Jawaid] Capital Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Bharany, Salil] Guru Nanak Dev Univ, Dept Comp Engn & Technol, Amritsar 143005, Punjab, India","","Ullah, SS (corresponding author), Univ Agder UiA, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, N-4898 Grimstad, Norway.;Bharany, S (corresponding author), Guru Nanak Dev Univ, Dept Comp Engn & Technol, Amritsar 143005, Punjab, India.","talkshuaib@gmail.com; summi.badotra@gmail.com; irfanse6235@gmail.com; adalqarni@pnu.edu.sa; sajidullah718@gmail.com; s.bourouis@tu.edu.sa; awaid5825@gmail.com; salil.bharany@gmail.com; g.lokesh6900@gmail.com","SHUAIB, MOHAMMED/AHD-4560-2022; Bourouis, Sami/N-4995-2019; Ullah, Syed Sajid/ABF-6478-2020","SHUAIB, MOHAMMED/0000-0001-6657-2587; Bourouis, Sami/0000-0002-6638-7039; Ullah, Syed Sajid/0000-0002-5406-0389; Bharany, Salil/0000-0002-2282-0419; Iqbal, Dr.Jawaid/0000-0002-5045-7485; Badotra, Dr. Sumit/0000-0003-1950-5386; Khalid, Muhammad Irfan/0000-0002-6643-6558","Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [PNURSP2022R51]; Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia [TURSP-2020/26]","Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University); Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia","This work is supported by Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers Supporting Project number (PNURSP2022R51), Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

To tackle the issues caused by selfish mining, this work proposes a novel scheme called ???Towards the Rear Attuned Defense Scheme???. Accordingly, to identify the presence of selfish miners, the Newfangled selfish mining revelation algorithm with a Fork Tenacity Strategy is used here. A weighted fork with a secured fail parameter is established here to compete with the block race caused by the selfish miner. Finally, to ensure reliability, a Slice-up Tender mint consensus protocol is used. Thus, our proposed scheme ensures a better defense against the selfish mining attacks and achieves better time convergence with less electricity fee.","[Pathan, Summiya A.; Shariff, Noorullah C.] SECAB Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Bijapur 586101, Karnataka, India","","Pathan, SA (corresponding author), SECAB Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Bijapur 586101, Karnataka, India.","summias@gmail.com; cnshariff1@gmail.com","","","","","","","20","0","0","1","1","INST INFORMATION SCIENCE","TAIPEI","ACADEMIA SINICA, TAIPEI 115, TAIWAN","1016-2364","","","J INF SCI ENG","J.

Different types of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Tether do not depend on a central authority. Decision making is complicated by categorization and transmission of uncertainty, as well as verification of digital currency. The weighted average and weighted geometric aggregation operators are used in this article to define a multi-attribute decision-making approach. This work investigates the uniqueness of q-rung orthopair fuzzy hypersoft sets (q-ROFHSS), which respond to instabilities, uncertainty, ambiguity, and imprecise information. This research also covers some fundamental topics of q-ROFHSS. The model offered here is the best option for learning about electronic currency. This study validates the complexity of decision-making problems with different attributes and subattributes to obtain an optimal choice. We conclude that Bitcoin has a diverse set of applications and that crypto assets are well positioned to become an important asset class in decision making.","[Khan, Salma; Gulistan, Muhammad] Hazara Univ Mansehra, Dept Math & Stat, Mansehra, Pakistan; [Kausar, Nasreen] Yildiz Tech Univ, Fac Arts & Sci, Dept Math, TR-34210 Istanbul, Turkey; [Kousar, Sajida] Int Islamic Univ Islamabad, Dept Math & Stat, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Pamucar, Dragan] Univ Belgrade, Facul Org Sci, Belgrade, Serbia; [Addis, Gezahagne Mulat] Univ Gondar, Dept Math, POB 196, Gondar, Ethiopia","","Addis, GM (corresponding author), Univ Gondar, Dept Math, POB 196, Gondar, Ethiopia.","gezahagne412@gmail.com","Gulistan, Muhammad/AAJ-7009-2020; Pamucar, Dragan/AAG-8288-2019; Addis, Gezahagne Mulat/GSD-9701-2022","Gulistan, Muhammad/0000-0002-6438-1047; Pamucar, Dragan/0000-0001-8522-1942; Addis, Gezahagne Mulat/0000-0002-6735-6832","","","","","35","0","0","0","0","WILEY-HINDAWI","LONDON","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND","1076-2787","1099-0526","","COMPLEXITY","Complexity","JUL 13","2022","2022","","","","","","","","7257449","10.1155/2022/7257449","http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/7257449","","","16","Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Mathematics; Science & Technology - Other Topics","3H3GO","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000831927000002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Ledgers such as the blockchain underlying Bitcoin can process fewer than 10 transactions per second (TPS). The cost of transactions is high, and the time to confirm a transaction is in the minutes. We present the BlockGraph, a scalable distributed public ledger inspired by principles of computer architecture. The BlockGraph exploits the natural locality of transactions to allow publishing independent transactions in parallel. It extends the blockchain with three new transactions to create a unified consistent ledger out of essentially independent blockchains. The most important change is the introduction of the blockstamp transaction, which essentially checkpoints a local blockchain and secures it against attack. The result is a locality-based, simple, secure, sharding protocol which keeps all transactions readable. This paper introduces the BlockGraph protocol, proves that it is consistent and can achieve many thousands of TPS. Using our implementation (a small extension to Bitcoin core) we demonstrate that it, in practice, can significantly improve throughput.","[Goldstein, Seth Copen; Gao, Sixiang] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Sun, Zhenbo] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China","","Goldstein, SC (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.","seth@cmu.edu; sixiangg@andrew.cmu.edu; sunzb20@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn","","Goldstein, Seth/0000-0003-1512-0446","","","","","37","0","0","4","4","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0926-8782","1573-7578","","DISTRIB PARALLEL DAT","Distrib.

Our results show that coin-ranking sites, such as Coinmarketcap, Coingecko and BraveNewCoin (i) include most of the cryptocurrency trading activity and (ii) are essentially characterised by the same underlying processes as the main exchange platforms (Coinbase and Bitstamp) and alternative coin-ranking sites (Cryptocompare), regardless of the possible issues arising from the aggregation of different exchanges to compute a unique cryptocurrency price. Therefore, we state that these databases are appropriate to conduct research. At any rate, we observe that all the databases analysed in this paper show the same underlying process for most liquid cryptocurrencies; consequently, scholars could use any of them for their studies, as long as they consider the different trading activity included by each database. This result is supported by an empirical analysis focused on weak-form market efficiency, since we report the same degree of efficiency regardless of the database and exchange platform. Nevertheless, we recognise the need for further research, given the gap in the literature and the black-box method used by coin-ranking sites to compute a unique cryptocurrency price.","[Vidal-Tomas, David] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6EA, England; [Vidal-Tomas, David] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain","","Vidal-Tomas, D (corresponding author), Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.","dvidal@uji.es","","","","","","","51","3","3","7","7","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1057-5219","1873-8079","","INT REV FINANC ANAL","Int.

We employed different definitions of dead coins, ranging from academic literature to professional practice; alternative forecasting models, ranging from credit scoring models to machine learning and time-series-based models; and different forecasting horizons. We found that the choice of the coin-death definition affected the set of the best forecasting models to compute the probability of death. However, this choice was not critical, and the best models turned out to be the same in most cases. In general, we found that the cauchit and the zero-price-probability (ZPP) based on the random walk or the Markov Switching-GARCH(1,1) were the best models for newly established coins, whereas credit-scoring models and machine-learning methods using lagged trading volumes and online searches were better choices for older coins.

Design/methodology/approach The pooled ordinary least squares regression is used on a sample of 138 listed financial firms from four emerging Asian countries for the period 2016-2020. Findings This study finds that changes in VC values have greater spillover effects on the values of financial stocks in countries which do not recognize the legitimacy of VCs than in countries which do, due to the lack of breadth and depth of the former markets. Moreover, this paper also reports evidence of the greater moderating role of investor attention on this relationship in countries which do not recognize the legitimacy of VCs than in countries which do. Originality/value Although numerous studies have been conducted on the influence of VCs on stock performance, majority of these studies did not distinguish whether the sample countries being studied actually recognize the legitimacy of VC transactions or not. Moreover, extant literature has not considered the moderating role of investor attention on this relationship. It is the aim of this study to address these research voids by using a refined three-factor theory model of capital asset pricing model incorporating VCs to better represent stock performance in the digital economy era.","[Ang, Ming Torng; Chow, Yee Peng] Tunku Abdul Rahman Univ Coll, Fac Accountancy Finance & Business, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","","Chow, YP (corresponding author), Tunku Abdul Rahman Univ Coll, Fac Accountancy Finance & Business, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.","angmt@tarc.edu.my; chowyeepeng@gmail.com","","","","","","","71","0","0","2","2","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1358-1988","1740-0279","","J FINANC REGUL COMPL","J.

For the non-mining coins, a low connectedness with all mining coins and tokens versus a high connectedness with Stellar are highlighted. The results show also that, unlike previous studies, Ethereum is the dominant contributor to volatility spillover and the only CC net pairwise transmitter in our sample. Interestingly, we find that most of the tokens are highly connected with their platform (Ethereum) rather than bitcoin.

However, with the increasing number of various devices and improved processing power, the amount of generated data is becoming gigantic. Therefore, this calls for a cost-effective way to outsource massively generated data to a remote server. Cloud service providers utilise deduplication technique which deduplicates redundant data by aborting identical uploading requests and deleting redundant files. However, current deduplication mechanisms mainly focus on the storage saving of the server, and ignore the sustainable and long-term financial interests of servers and users. This is not helpful to expand outsourcing and deduplication services. Blockchain is an ideal solution to achieve an economical and incentive-driven deduplication system. Though some current research studiess have integrated deduplication with blockchain, they did not utilise blockchain as a financial tool. Meanwhile, it lacks an arbitration mechanism to settle disputes between the server and the user, especially in a Bitcoin payment where the payment is not confirmed immediately and a dispute may occur. This creates a burden to achieve fair and transparent incentive-based deduplication service. In this work, we construct a deduplication system with financial incentives for the server and the user based on Bitcoin. The data owner will pay money via Bitcoin to the server for outsourcing the file, but this fee can be compensated by charging deduplication users with some fees to acquire the deduplication service. The server and the user can receive revenues using deduplication service. Disputes on the fair distribution of incentives can be settled by our arbitration protocol with chameleon hashes as arbitration tags. We give concrete construction and security requirements for our proposed BDAI. The security analysis shows that our BDAI is theoretically secure. The performance evaluation shows that our proposed BDAI is acceptably efficient for the deduplication. Meanwhile, we evaluate and conclude that 1% of outsourcing fee (or less) is a reasonable and preferable price for each deduplication user to pay as compensation for data owner.","[Huang, Ke; Zhang, Xiaosong] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China UESTC, Coll Cyber Secur, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaosong] Cyberspace Secur Res Ctr, Peng Cheng Lab, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Mu, Yi] City Univ Macau, Inst Data Sci, Taipa, Macao, Peoples R China; [Rezaeibagha, Fatemeh] Murdoch Univ, Sch Engn & Informat Technol, Perth, WA, Australia; [Huang, Xiaoming] CETC Cyberspace Secur Res Inst Co Ltd, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Gong, Yongcheng] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China UESTC, Sch Optoelect Sci & Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China","","Zhang, XS (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China UESTC, Coll Cyber Secur, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China.","johnsonzxs@uestc.edu.cn","","huang, ke/0000-0002-5102-610X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [62002048, 61872087, U19A2066, 62072078]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0802300, 2018YFB08040505, 2018YFB0804100]; Research Initiation Fund (Central Universities) [Y030202059018061]; Blockchain Research Lab of UESTC, Chengdu Jiaozi Financial Holding Group Company Ltd","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Research Initiation Fund (Central Universities); Blockchain Research Lab of UESTC, Chengdu Jiaozi Financial Holding Group Company Ltd","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 62002048, 61872087, U19A2066, 62072078; National Key R&D Program of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 2017YFB0802300, 2018YFB08040505, 2018YFB0804100; Research Initiation Fund (Central Universities), Grant/Award Number: Y030202059018061; Blockchain Research Lab of UESTC, Chengdu Jiaozi Financial Holding Group Company Ltd","","32","0","0","3","3","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1751-8709","1751-8717","","IET INFORM SECUR","IET Inf.

We designed Machine Learning (ML) systems that can trade four major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, and Solana. We found that more indicators do not necessarily mean better trading performance. Swing traders that use daily bars should trade Bitcoin and Solana using Ichimoku Cloud (IC) plus Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Ethereum with IC plus Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), and BNB with IC alone. With regard to intraday trading, we documented that different cryptocurrencies should be trading using different time frames. These results emphasize that the optimal number of indicators that are used to trade daily bars is one or, at maximum, two. The Multi-Layer (MUL) system that consists of all three examined technical indicators failed to improve the trading results for both days (swing) and intraday trades.

On the other hand, inferring blockchain account types (i.e., miners, smart contracts or exchanges), which are also referred to as blockchain identities, is significant in many scenarios, such as risk assessment and trade regulation. Existing work on blockchain deanonymization mainly focuses on Bitcoin that supports simple transactions of cryptocurrencies. As the popularity of decentralized application (DApp) platform blockchains with Turing-complete smart contracts, represented by Ethereum, identity inference in blockchain faces new challenges because of user diversity and complexity of activities enabled by smart contracts. In this paper, we propose I(2)GL, an identify inference approach based on big graph analytics and learning to address these challenges. Specifically, I(2)GL constructs a transaction graph and aims to infer the identity of nodes using the graph learning technique based on Graph Convolutional Networks. Furthermore, a series of enhancement has been proposed by exploiting unique features of blockchain transaction graph. The experimental results on Ethereum transaction records show that I(2)GL significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.","[Liu, Xiao] Peking Univ, Wangxuan Inst Comp Technol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Tang, Zaiyang; Fan, Xuepeng] YeeZ Tech, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Tang, Zaiyang; Fan, Xuepeng] ASRes, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Peng] Univ Aizu, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Aizu Wakamatsu, Fukushima, Japan; [Guo, Song] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jinbo] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","","Li, P (corresponding author), Univ Aizu, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Aizu Wakamatsu, Fukushima, Japan.","pengli@u-aizu.ac.jp","Guo, Song/AAZ-4542-2020","Guo, Song/0000-0001-9831-2202; Liu, Xiao/0000-0003-4129-5821","JSPS [JP19K20258]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFB1003500]; Hong Kong RGC Research Impact Fund (RIF) [R5034-18]","JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Hong Kong RGC Research Impact Fund (RIF)","This research was financially supported by the JSPS Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research JP19K20258, National Key Research and Development Program of China under grant 2018YFB1003500 and Hong Kong RGC Research Impact Fund (RIF) with the Project No. R5034-18.","","39","4","4","11","11","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2168-6750","","","IEEE T EMERG TOP COM","IEEE Trans.

It has turned out as a leading method for peer-to-peer online cash systems. Due to the importance and increasing influence of Bitcoin on business and other related sectors, it is very crucial to model or predict its behavior. Therefore, in recent, numerous researchers have attempted to understand and model the behaviors of cryptocurrency exchange rates. In the practice of actuarial and financial studies, heavy-tailed distributions play a fruitful role in modeling and describing the log returns of financial phenomena. In this paper, we propose a new family of distributions that possess heavy-tailed characteristics. Based on the proposed approach, a modified version of the logistic distribution, namely, a new modified exponential-logistic distribution is introduced. To illustrate the new modified exponential-logistic model, two financial data sets are analyzed. The first data set represents the log-returns of the Bitcoin exchange rates. Whereas, the second data set represents the log-returns of the Ethereum exchange rates. Furthermore, to forecast the high volatile behavior of the same datasets, we apply dual machine learning algorithms, namely Artificial neural network and support vector regression. The effectiveness of these models is evaluated against self exciting threshold autoregressive model.","[Ahmad, Zubair; Almaspoor, Zahra] Yazd Univ, Dept Stat, POB 89175741, Yazd, Iran; [Khan, Faridoon] PIDE Sch Econ, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Alhazmi, Sharifah E.] Umm Al Qura Univ, Al Qunfudah Univ Coll, Math Dept, Mecca, Saudi Arabia; [El-Morshedy, M.] Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz Univ, Coll Sci & Humanities Al Kharj, Dept Math, Al Kharj 11942, Saudi Arabia; [El-Morshedy, M.] Mansoura Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Math, Mansoura 35516, Egypt; [Ababneh, O.

The purpose of the research is to try to explain the reasons for the emergence of electronic money, their role, benefits, and risks to the global digital economy from the standpoint of syncretic logic. The value of Bitcoin USD (BTC-USD) in the financial market for the period 17.09.2014 - 30.11.2021 has been used in the research. Based on the closing price, profitability and volatility for different time periods are calculated in order to quantify the risks of new digital currencies. The results attest to the fact that in the digital economy, separate segments of the digital payment instruments market are developing, where specific information is sold and bought, designed to meet specific consumer needs and is not suitable for use as a general equivalent. On the other hand, the practice of using digital monetary units has not yet become so widespread that would allow considering them not as a surrogate for money, but as an independent form of money and collecting empirical material necessary and sufficient for analysis. The cryptocurrency market is growing rapidly forasmuch as the financial product, bitcoin, is popular with investors, the demand for which is growing significantly. It has been revealed that bitcoin acts as an object of purchase and sale in the financial market, the value of which is established thanks to another common equivalent, in particular, the US dollar. Along with this, the profitability level fluctuates significantly, and volatility depends on market conditions and various environmental factors, fluctuating significantly with the slightest changes. The dynamics of prices indicate a gradual increase in the value of the cryptocurrency, despite the fall in its price, depending on various factors. The growing popularity of the currency is evidenced by the expansion of its issue volume and the growth of the market as a whole.","[Hordiienko, Maryna] Admiral Makarov Natl Univ Shipbldg, Fac Engn & Econ, Dept Social & Gen Tech Disciplines, Mykolaiv, Ukraine; [Perchuk, Oksana] Hryhorii Skovoroda Univ Pereiaslav, Dept Finance Accounting & Taxat, Pereiaslav, Ukraine; [Bondarenko, Iryna] Yaroslav Mudryi Natl Law Univ, Dept Financial Law, Kharkiv, Ukraine; [Svichkar, Vitalii] Natl Univ Yuri Kondratyuk Poltava Polytech, Dept Int Econ Relat & Tourism, Poltava, Ukraine; [Kronda, Olha] Taras Shevchenko Natl Univ Kyiv, Dept Intellectual Property & Informat Law, Kiev, Ukraine","","Hordiienko, M (corresponding author), Admiral Makarov Natl Univ Shipbldg, Fac Engn & Econ, Dept Social & Gen Tech Disciplines, Mykolaiv, Ukraine.","hordiienko_maryna@ukr.net; ruru23@ukr.net; irina.bon.khII@gmail.com; svII33II@gmail.com; kronda.olga@gmail.com","Kronda, Olha/GRR-4009-2022; Bondarenko, Irina M./F-5302-2019","Bondarenko, Irina M./0000-0001-6561-9857","","","","","17","0","0","4","4","MAGNANIMITAS","HRADEC KRALOVE","CESKOSLOVENSKE ARMADY 300, HRADEC KRALOVE, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC","1804-7890","","","AD ALTA-INTERDISCIP","AD ALTA-J.

However, some crucial tasks cannot be left solely to an algorithm and, consequently, most DeFi applications still require human decisions. The aim of this research is to assess the role of intermediation in the light of DeFi, analysing how humans and algorithms will interact. Design/methodology/approach The authors based their work on a twofold qualitative methodology, first analysing publicly available secondary data, particularly from white papers and DeFi Pulse (a website providing data on DeFi solutions) and then running two focus group discussions. Findings DeFi does not eliminate financial intermediation, but enables it to be performed in new ways, where decentralization means that no single entity can hold too much power or monopoly. DeFi has, however, inherited risks from the underlying technologies that unintentionally facilitate illegal behaviour and can hamper the authorities' supervision. The complex duality algorithm- vs human-based actions will not be solved indisputably in favour of the former, as DeFi solutions can range from requiring algorithms to play a dominant role, to enabling greater human interaction by actively involving more people. Originality/value This research contributes to the emerging debate between algorithm- and human-based intermediation, especially in relation to the standing literature on financial intermediation, where considerations made in the light of the newest theories on blockchain and DeFi are still scarce.","[Grassi, Laura; Lanfranchi, Davide; Faes, Alessandro; Renga, Filippo Maria] Politecn Milan, Sch Management, Milan, Italy","","Grassi, L (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Sch Management, Milan, Italy.","laura.grassi@polimi.it","","Lanfranchi, Davide/0000-0002-1774-7026","","","","","129","5","5","37","45","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1176-6093","1758-7654","","QUAL RES ACCOUNT MAN","Qual.

While proposing promising alternatives to the original Bitcoin protocol is an important goal that the bulk of the effort in blockchain community has been focused on, it may not be enough. A major challenge faced by blockchain systems goes beyond the ability to superficially explore their attack surface, and firstly must consider the importance of studying the functioning of their underlying consensus protocols also in the form of non-functional properties such as security and safety. It is to this extent that recent research has started to rigorously analyze the Bitcoin protocol and its close variants, whilst BET-like systems have not received equal attention so far. In this paper, we focus on the XRP Ledger with the aim to lay down the first steps towards the complete formalization of its unique consensus mechanism. We provide a thorough description of its different phases and present an analysis of some of its properties, which will be suitable as a basis for future research in the same vein.","[Mauri, Lara; Cimato, Stelvio; Damiani, Ernesto] Univ Milan, Comp Sci Dept, Milan, Italy; [Damiani, Ernesto] Khalifa Univ, Ctr Cyber Phys Syst, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","","Cimato, S (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Comp Sci Dept, Milan, Italy.","lara.mauri@unimi.it; stelvio.cimato@unimi.it; ernesto.damiani@unimi.it","damiani, ernesto/AAI-5709-2020; MAURI, LARA/W-8976-2018","damiani, ernesto/0000-0002-9557-6496; CIMATO, STELVIO/0000-0003-1737-6218; MAURI, LARA/0000-0002-4024-1015","EC within the Project CONCORDIA [H2020-830927]","EC within the Project CONCORDIA","This work has been partly supported by the EC within the Project CONCORDIA (H2020-830927).","","40","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","1865-0929","1865-0937","978-3-030-94900-6; 978-3-030-94899-3","COMM COM INF SC","","","2022","1545","","","","","","48","72","","10.1007/978-3-030-94900-6_3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-94900-6_3","","","25","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BS7NM","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000765271900003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

As the available space inside a block is limited, users must compete against each other by submitting higher fees to obtain this limited resource. In this paper, we model blockchain transaction inclusion as a time-sensitive dynamic game, where users base their fees depending on both what their competitors in the network are offering, and by their own urgency of having their transactions approved. We then investigate the effect that mempool congestion (the aggregate size of transactions waiting to be confirmed) and different block sizes have on the fees users would be willing to pay. Our analysis concludes that miners have no rational reason to artificially limit the block size, which is in direct contrast with previous research findings. Instead, we find that increasing the block size in relation to a growing mempool both lowers the individual fees that users have to pay, and increases the total in fees collected, which raises not only the utility of the miners, but also of the regular users of the blockchain system.","[Kruminis, Edvinas; Navaie, Keivan] Univ Lancaster, Sch Comp & Commun, Lancaster LA1 4WA, England","","Kruminis, E (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Sch Comp & Commun, Lancaster LA1 4WA, England.","e.kruminis@lancaster.ac.uk","","Kruminis, Edvinas/0000-0003-1428-1475; Navaie, Keivan/0000-0002-4399-6472","School of Computing and Communications (SCC) Department, Lancaster University, Faculty of Science and Technology (FST) Impact [SEF1216]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/K/022725/1]","School of Computing and Communications (SCC) Department, Lancaster University, Faculty of Science and Technology (FST) Impact; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This work was supported in part by the Ph.D. Scholarship provided by the School of Computing and Communications (SCC) Department, Lancaster University, Faculty of Science and Technology (FST) Impact, under Grant SEF1216; and in part by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under Grant EP/K/022725/1.","","15","0","0","5","7","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","5002","5011","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3140921","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3140921","","","10","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","YJ4CS","","gold, Green Accepted","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000744481800001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We deliver a sharded blockchain technology with unlimited scalability, called KSI Cash, which is based on a new form of electronic money scheme, the bill scheme. We present performance tests of KSI Cash that we have conducted with the European Central Bank in order to assess the feasibility of a digital euro. We show the system operating with 100 million wallets and 15,000 transactions per second (under simulation of realistic usage); having an estimated carbon footprint of 0.0001g CO2 per transaction. Furthermore, we show the system operating with up to 2 million payment orders per second, an equivalent of more than 300,000 transactions per second (in a laboratory setting with the central components of KSI Cash), scaling linearly in the number of shards. We explain, in detail, the key concepts that unlock this performance (i.e., the concepts of the bill money scheme). The results provide evidence that the scalability of our technology is unlimited in both permissioned and permissionless scenarios, resulting into the Alphabill Money technology. Next, we contribute the architecture of a universal tokenization platform that allows for universal asset tokenization, transfer and exchange as a global medium of exchange, called Alphabill platform. We reveal the crucial conceptual and technical contributions of the platform's architecture, including the data structures of KSI Cash and Alphabill Money, the dust collection solution of Alphabill Money, and the atomic swap solution of the Alphabill platform.","[Buldas, Ahto; Laanoja, Risto] Tallinn Univ Technol, Ctr Digital Forens & Cyber Secur, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia; [Buldas, Ahto; Laanoja, Risto; Saarepera, Mart; Simm, Joosep; Steiner, Jamie; Truu, Ahto] Guardtime, EE-11316 Tallinn, Estonia; [Draheim, Dirk] Tallinn Univ Technol, Informat Syst Grp, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia; [Gault, Mike] Guardtime, CH-1006 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Nagumo, Takehiko] Mitsubishi UFJ Res & Consulting, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1058501, Japan; [Nagumo, Takehiko] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Management, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Saarepera, Mart] Martest Res, EE-11317 Tallinn, Estonia; [Shah, Syed Attique] Birmingham City Univ, Sch Comp & Digital Technol, Birmingham B4 7XG, W Midlands, England; [Tammet, Tanel] Tallinn Univ Technol, Appl Artificial Intelligence Grp, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia","","Buldas, A (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ Technol, Ctr Digital Forens & Cyber Secur, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia.;Buldas, A (corresponding author), Guardtime, EE-11316 Tallinn, Estonia.;Draheim, D (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ Technol, Informat Syst Grp, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia.","ahto.buldas@taltech.ee; dirk.drahem@taltech.ee","Shah, Syed Attique/ABD-6564-2021","Shah, Syed Attique/0000-0003-2949-7391; Tammet, Tanel/0000-0003-4414-3874; Steiner, Jamie/0000-0002-3731-5108; Gault, Michael/0000-0002-4860-7077; Simm, Joosep/0000-0002-1952-4803; Draheim, Dirk/0000-0003-3376-7489","","","","","162","0","0","3","3","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","77284","77322","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3192837","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3192837","","","39","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","3I8AX","","gold, Green Submitted","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000832933400001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Despite increasing fraudulent activity involving cryptocurrencies, research on the potential of cryptocurrencies for fraud has not been examined in a systematic study. This review examines the current state of knowledge about what kinds of cryptocurrency fraud currently exist, or are expected to exist in the future, and provides comprehensive definitions of the frauds identified. Methods: The study involved a scoping review of academic research and grey literature on cryptocurrency fraud and a 1.5-day expert consensus exercise. The review followed the PRISMA-ScR protocol, with eligibility criteria based on language, publication type, relevance to cryptocurrency fraud, and evidence provided. Researchers screened 391 academic records, 106 of which went on to the eligibility phase, and 63 of which were ultimately analysed. We screened 394 grey literature sources, 128 of which passed on to the eligibility phase, and 53 of which were included in our review. The expert consensus exercise was attended by high-profile participants from the private sector, government, and academia. It involved problem planning and analysis activities and discussion about the future of cryptocurrency crime. Results: The academic literature identified 29 different types of cryptocurrency fraud; the grey literature discussed 32 types, 14 of which were not identified in the academic literature (i.e., 47 unique types in total). Ponzi schemes and (synonymous) high yield investment programmes were most discussed across all literature. Participants in the expert consensus exercise ranked pump-and-dump schemes and ransomware as the most profitable and feasible threats, though pump-and-dumps were, notably, perceived as the least harmful type of fraud. Conclusions: The findings of this scoping review suggest cryptocurrency fraud research is rapidly developing in volume and breadth, though we remain at an early stage of thinking about future problems and scenarios involving cryptocurrencies. The findings of this work emphasise the need for better collaboration across sectors and consensus on definitions surrounding cryptocurrency fraud to address the problems identified.","[Trozze, Arianna; Kamps, Josh; Akartuna, Eray Arda; Kleinberg, Bennett; Johnson, Shane D.] UCL, Dawes Ctr Future Crime, 35 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9EZ, England; [Trozze, Arianna; Kamps, Josh; Akartuna, Eray Arda; Hetzel, Florian J.; Kleinberg, Bennett; Davies, Toby; Johnson, Shane D.] UCL, Dept Secur & Crime Sci, 35 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9EZ, England; [Kleinberg, Bennett] Tilburg Univ, Dept Methodol & Stat, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Trozze, Arianna] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6EA, England","","Trozze, A (corresponding author), UCL, Dawes Ctr Future Crime, 35 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9EZ, England.","arianna.trozze@ucl.ac.uk","Trozze, Arianna/GQZ-6371-2022","Davies, Toby/0000-0002-9677-2579; Akartuna, Eray Arda/0000-0002-2724-0819; Trozze, Arianna/0000-0001-7383-4477","Dawes Centre for Future Crime at UCL; UK EPSRC [EP/S022503/1]","Dawes Centre for Future Crime at UCL; UK EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This project was funded by the Dawes Centre for Future Crime at UCL and UK EPSRC Grant EP/S022503/1 that supports the Centre for Doctoral Training in Cybersecurity at UCL.","","153","1","1","11","19","BMC","LONDON","CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","","2193-7680","","CRIME SCI","Crime Sci.","JAN 5","2022","11","1","","","","","","","1","10.1186/s40163-021-00163-8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40163-021-00163-8","","","35","Criminology & Penology","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Criminology & Penology","YC0QA","35013699","gold, Green Published","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000739403600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Design/methodology/approach A popular tool, the Bivariate GARCH model (BEKK-GARCH), to study the volatility spillover effect, is applied in the study. Monthly data of cryptocurrencies and inflation (WPI and CPI indices) are gathered from 2015 to 2021. Findings Significant short-term responsiveness of volatility of cryptocurrencies on the inflation volatility is found. In addition to this, the significant volatility spillover effect from the cryptocurrencies to the inflation volatility is found. Practical implications The findings of the current paper can be of use for inflation management, target inflation policies and policies to contain the volatility of cryptocurrencies. The significance of the current paper is relevant as governments worldwide are officially recognizing cryptocurrencies and starting the process of launching their official virtual currency. Originality/value No other study is observed on the topic. Hence, the contribution and novelty of the findings of the current paper are very high and add value to the nonexistent literature on the topic. Lack of the number of inflation observations (data of CPI and WPI are available only in monthly frequency) crimps the model estimation. As the cryptocurrencies become old, more data points will be available by design, and such problems can be resolved, and better model estimation may be possible.","[Rastogi, Shailesh; Kanoujiya, Jagjeevan] Symbiosis Int Univ, Symbiosis Inst Business Management Pune, Fac Management, Pune, Maharashtra, India","","Kanoujiya, J (corresponding author), Symbiosis Int Univ, Symbiosis Inst Business Management Pune, Fac Management, Pune, Maharashtra, India.","krishnasgdas@gmail.com; jagjeevan24288@yahoo.co.in","Rastogi, Shailesh/AAU-1920-2020","Rastogi, Shailesh/0000-0001-6766-8708","","","","","85","0","0","3","4","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1026-4116","2054-6246","","J ECONOM ADM SCI","J.

At present, more and more investors have focused their investment in the blockchain virtual currency. Transaction data of blockchain virtual currency belongs to the financial time series, which is noisy and random, bringing challenges to the prediction of transaction trends. The improved deep belief network (IDBN) model and Echo state network (ESN) are constructed based on deep belief network (DBN) model to explore the long short-term memory (LSTM) model and the transaction prediction of blockchain virtual currency under the DBN and to improve the transaction prediction accuracy of the blockchain virtual currency. In addition, the parameters of IDBN model were optimized using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which are verified with the transaction data of stocks and blockchain virtual currencies (Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum), and compared with other cash algorithms for analysis. The results show that the PSO-IDBN-based time series prediction model proposed in this study can be applied to predicting the high-latitude and high -complexity data, showing superior performance compared to the traditional time series prediction and other deep learning prediction methods. @2021 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, investors worldwide have been interested in cryptocurrencies with increasing acceleration due to high earning expectations though they have no backing and intrinsic value. As such, this paper seeks to identify the most proper cryptocurrencies from an investment standpoint in our technological era. Fifteen well-known cryptocurrencies with the highest market capitalization are evaluated as per sixteen factors. An intuitionistic fuzzy set-driven methodology incorporating Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), Multi-Attributive Ideal Real Comparative Analysis (MAIRCA, and Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solution (MARCOS), which is the study's prominent novelty, has been applied to provide a strong group decision vehicle for cryptocurrency selection. Notwithstanding, although the results obtained with the three approaches are highly consistent, investors would not like to doubt the instrument they will invest in. The Borda count is then applied to obtain a compromise for the rankings obtained from each approach. As per our findings, Ethereum, Tether, and Bitcoin are the most suitable cryptocurrencies, whereas reliable software, ease of inclusion in the wallet, and stability are the foremost factors to consider when investing in cryptocurrencies.

Research methodology - the methodology of empirical research includes methods of scientific literature analysis, statistical data analysis, multicriteria evaluation, correlation analysis. Findings - Bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency, but this result could have been due to an exceptionally high market capitalization. Based on the results of the analysis, the inclusion of Bitcoin, Etherium and Dogecoin in the investment portfolio of S&P500, Euro Stoxx 50, DAX and CAC 40 indexes could be considered. Terra could be an interesting investment when considering the benefits of diversification. Research limitations - based on the results of the study, the inclusion of all studied cryptocurrencies in the investment portfolio could be considered in order to diversify the portfolio, taking into account their investment attractiveness. Practical implications - Cryptocurrencies attract investors not only because of the returns they receive, but also because of the absence of intermediaries, which allows them to reduce transaction costs. High returns are associated with high risks, so it is necessary to conduct as much research as possible to identify the benefits of cryptocurrencies and to find risk management strategies. One such benefit of cryptocurrencies highlighted in research is diversification. Originality/Value - the novelty of the study lies in evaluation of 10 selected cryptocurrencies according to different criteria using a multi-criteria valuation method to identify cryptocurrencies that are non-correlated or weakly correlated with traditional assets and the most suitable for investment and for portfolio diversification.","[Juskaite, Lina; Gudelyte-Zilinskiene, Laura] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Business Management, Dept Financial Engn, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania","","Gudelyte-Zilinskiene, L (corresponding author), Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Business Management, Dept Financial Engn, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.","laura.gudelyte-zilinskiene@vilniustech.lt","","","","","","","36","1","1","3","3","VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV","VILNIUS","SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA","2669-2481","2669-249X","","BUS MANAG ECON ENG","Bus.

The results across different time scales are tested for noise using permutation entropy technique, empirical estimations are represented in statistical complexity plane to show the structure of efficiency links. Usage of AMIM in short window estimation is justified. Efficiency levels seem to be closely connected if judged from the standpoint of information theory at all time frames. Efficiency linkages become more linear at larger analysis periods. Cryptocurrencies seem to be more closely connected to equities, especially S&P500.

Design/methodology/approach The closing prices of six cryptocurrencies have been considered. The study employs different classical tests for checking if the efficiency behaviour is similar during Ramadan celebration days and non-Ramadan days. Besides, dummy variable regression technique for assessing this anomaly on returns and volatilities has been applied. Findings Although no significant effect on returns and volatility for Litecoin has been found, the results provide evidence about the existence of the Ramadan effects in cryptocurrency markets. The results of the mean equations show the existence of Ramadan effect for Ethereum, Ripple, Stellar and BinanceCoin for all considered models. Significant effect on Bitcoin returns is found with an autoregressive model of order 1. The results of conditional volatility show Ramadan effect on volatility is not detected. Originality/value First, a new contribution in the incipient study of cryptocurrency analysis. Second, a comprehensive review of recently published empirical articles about Ramadan effect on traditional assets has been carried out. Third, unlike most of the papers focussed on the study of Bitcoin, this study has been extended to six cryptocurrencies. Ramadan effect have not been analysed in cryptomarkets yet. This study come to fill this gap and analyses Ramadan effect, previously documented for traditional assets, in particular, stock index from Muslim countries, but not yet analysed in the cryptocurrency markets.","[Lopez-Martin, Carmen] Natl Distance Educ Univ UNED, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Business & Accounting, Madrid, Spain","","Lopez-Martin, C (corresponding author), Natl Distance Educ Univ UNED, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Business & Accounting, Madrid, Spain.","carmen.lopez@cee.uned.es","López-Martín, Carmen/R-3402-2018","López-Martín, Carmen/0000-0001-6520-4950","Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [PID2020-113367RB-I00]","Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government)","Funding: This work has been funded by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (PID2020-113367RB-I00).

This article aims to analyse the financial risk characteristics of individual cryptocurrencies and of a broad cryptocurrency market portfolio. We construct a portfolio comprising the 20 largest cryptocurrencies, which cover 82.1% of the total cryptocurrency market. The returns are examined for extreme tail risks by the application of Extreme Value Theory. We utilise the GARCH-EVT approach in combination with a novel algorithm to automatically determine the optimal threshold to model the tail distribution. Furthermore, we aggregate the individual market risks with a t-Student Copula to investigate possible diversification effects on a portfolio level. The empirical analysis indicates that all examined cryptocurrencies show high volatility in their price movements, whereby Bitcoin acts as the most stable cryptocurrency. All return distributions are heavy-tailed and subject to extreme tail risks. We find strong, positive intra-market correlations, in particular with the two largest cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum. No diversification effect can be achieved by aggregating market risks. On the contrary, a negligibly lower expected return and higher joint extreme returns can be observed. From this analysis, it can be concluded that investments in individual cryptocurrencies as well as in a portfolio show extreme risks of losses. From the investor's point of view, a possible strategy of risk reduction through portfolio formation within cryptocurrencies is only promising to a limited extent and does not offer a satisfactory solution to significantly reduce the risk within this asset class.","[Bruhn, Pascal; Ernst, Dietmar] Nuertingen Geislingen Univ, Int Sch Finance ISF, Sigmaringer Str 25, D-72622 Nurtingen, Germany","","Ernst, D (corresponding author), Nuertingen Geislingen Univ, Int Sch Finance ISF, Sigmaringer Str 25, D-72622 Nurtingen, Germany.","pascal.bruhn@financial-research.de; dietmar.ernst@hfwu.de","","","Ministerium fur Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst Baden-Wurttemberg and Nurtingen-Geislingen University","Ministerium fur Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst Baden-Wurttemberg and Nurtingen-Geislingen University","The article processing charge was funded by the Ministerium fur Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst Baden-Wurttemberg and Nurtingen-Geislingen University in the funding programme Open Access Publishing.","","57","0","0","0","0","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

Based on the non-linearity and asymmetry of the correlation between the fractal market hypothesis and the financial market, this study uses asym-metric multifractal cross-correlation analysis to study the correlation between a cryptocurrency and USD, RMB, and gold markets. First, using the MF-ADCCA method, an obvious asymmetric cross-correlation is found between a cryptocurrency and USD, RMB, and gold markets. USD, RMB, and gold markets are more effective than cryptocurrency markets. In particular, the impact of the RMB market on the cryptocurrency market is the largest among USD, RMB, and gold. When USD and RMB are rising, the risk conduction to cryptocurrencies is more significant. When gold is falling, the risk conduction to cryptocurrencies is more significant. When cryptocurrencies are falling, the risk conduction to USD is more significant. Among cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and New Economic Coin have more significant risk conduc-tion to RMB when it falls. Through the DMF-ADCCA method, a two-way asymmetric conduction effect is found between the lagging cryptocurrency and the USD, RMB, and gold markets. Compared with USD and gold, the risk correlation and conduction between RMB and cryptocurrency are the highest. Prevent -ing and controlling the risk impact of cryptocurrency on the RMB and further strengthening the research between cryptocurrency and the RMB are crucial to the internationalization of the RMB and the improve-ment of international competitiveness.

For the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES), non-normal distributions present the best performance. We also note the advantages of RVaR over ES regarding regulatory arbitrage and model misspecification.","[Mueller, Fernanda Maria; Santos, Samuel Solgon; Goessling, Thalles Weber; Righi, Marcelo Brutti] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Washington Luiz 855, BR-90010460 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil","","Muller, FM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Washington Luiz 855, BR-90010460 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.","fernanda.muller@ufrgs.br; samuel.solgon@ufrgs.br; thalles_3@hotmail.com; marcelo.righi@ufrgs.br","","Santos, Samuel/0000-0002-7343-4913; Righi, Marcelo/0000-0002-3753-0705; Weber Gossling, Thalles/0000-0002-5910-2250","CNPq (Brazilian Research Council) [302369/2018-0, 407556/2018-4]; CAPES, Brazil (Improvement of Higher Education Personnel) [88882.439088/2019-01]","CNPq (Brazilian Research Council)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES, Brazil (Improvement of Higher Education Personnel)","We are grateful for the financial support of CNPq (Brazilian Research Council) projects number 302369/2018-0 and 407556/2018-4, and for financial support from CAPES, Brazil (Improvement of Higher Education Personnel) under grant number 88882.439088/2019-01.

As a key underlying technology, blockchain technology can no longer meet most of the needs of digital currency transactions. Based on this, the digital asset is taken as the research object and an analysis model for digital asset value is established with the deep learning technology in this study. Then, the authorization mechanism in the distributed position and orientation system (DPOS) algorithm is extracted and applied to the precise backward error tracking (PBET) algorithm based on the existing consensus algorithm in blockchain technology. Thus, a dynamic delegated practical byzantine fault tolerance (DDPBFT) algorithm that can be applied to the blockchain is proposed. Finally, a supervisable digital currency system is constructed based on the improved blockchain technology. After specific analysis, it is found that the analysis model for digital asset value based on the deep learning proposed in this study shows good stability and accuracy, and can help enterprises to analyze the value of digital assets. Compared with the existing consensus mechanism algorithms, the proposed DDPBFT algorithm shows better results in terms of throughput and delay. Finally, the supervisable digital currency model based on the improved blockchain technology can unite the public chains, alliance chains, and user wallets, and realize the traceability of transaction information. In short, the quantitative analysis of the value of digital assets has been realized and the supervision of digital currency transactions has been achieved by using the improved blockchain technology.

However, a lightweight client is hard to verify a newly issued transaction, thus making the zero-confirmation transactions between lightweight clients impossible. In particular, transaction verification needs to verify that each referred output of the transaction is not previously spent. The conventional lightweight client design is unscalable as it can only support such an operation in the complexity of O(NT), where NT is the total number of transactions in the system. The latest proposals suggest summarizing all the unspent outputs in an ordered Merkle tree. Therefore, a light client can request proof of presence and/or absence of an element in it to prove whether a referred output is previously spent or not, in the complexity of O(log(NU)), where NU is the total number of unspent output in the system. However, updating such ordered Merkle tree is slow, thus making the system impractical-by our evaluation, when a new block is generated in Bitcoin, it takes more than one minute to update the ordered Merkle tree. We propose a practical client, TICK, to solve this problem. TICK uses the AVL hash tree to store all the unspent outputs. The AVL hash tree can be updated in the time of O(M*log(NU)), where M is the number of elements that need to be inserted or removed from the AVL hash tree. By evaluation, when a new block is generated, the AVL hash tree can be updated within 1 s. Similarly, the proof can also be generated in the time of O(log(NU)). Therefore, TICK is practical and scalable. Benefited by the AVL hash tree, a storage-limited device can efficiently and cryptographically verify transactions. In addition, rather than requiring new miners to download the entire blockchain before mining, TICK allows new miners to download only a small portion of data to start mining. We implement TICK for Bitcoin and provide an experimental evaluation on its performance by using the current Bitcoin blockchain data. Our result shows that the proof for verifying whether an output of a transaction is spent or not is only several kB. The verification is very fast-generating a proof generally takes less than 1 ms and verifying a proof even takes much less time. In addition, to start mining, new miners only need to download several GB data, rather than downloading over 230-GB data.","[Zhang, Wei; He, Qingqiang; Guan, Nan] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Jiangshan] Monash Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Zhang, Nan] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Informat Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","","Zhang, W (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","sduzhangwei1223@gmail.com","","Zhang, Wei/0000-0003-2615-2603; He, Qingqiang/0000-0001-5067-8571","","","","","30","1","1","0","0","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2327-4662","","","IEEE INTERNET THINGS","IEEE Internet Things J.","AUG 15","2022","9","16","","","","","14172","14184","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3015476","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.3015476","","","13","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","3R1VB","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000838706600008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

SHA-2 functions are often implemented on hardware to optimize performance and power. In addition to the high-performance and low-cost requirements, the hardware for SHA-2 must be highly flexible for many applications. This paper proposes an SHA-2 hardware architecture named the multimode SHA-2 accelerator (MSA), which has high performance and flexibility at the system-on-chip level. To achieve high performance and flexibility, our accelerator applies three optimal techniques. First, a multimode processing element architecture is proposed to enable the accelerator to compute various SHA-2 functions for many applications. Second, a three-stage arithmetic logic unit pipeline architecture is proposed to reduce the critical paths and hardware resources. Finally, nonce generator and nonce validator architectures are proposed to reduce memory access and maximize the performance of the proposed MSA for blockchain mining applications. The MSA accuracy is tested on a real hardware platform (the Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGA). The experimental results on the field programmable gate array (FPGA) prove that the proposed MSA achieves significantly better performance, hardware efficiency, and flexibility than previous works. The evaluation results for energy efficiency show that the proposed MSA achieves up to 38.05 Mhps/W, which is 543.6 and 29 times better than the state-of-the-art Intel i9-10940X CPU and RTX 3090 GPU, respectively.","[Hoai Luan Pham; Vu Trung Duong Le; Nakashima, Yasuhiko] Nara Inst Sci & Technol NAIST, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Nara 6300192, Japan; [Thi Hong Tran] Osaka City Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Osaka 5588585, Japan","","Tran, TH (corresponding author), Osaka City Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Osaka 5588585, Japan.","hong@osaka-cu.ac.jp","","Le Vu Trung, Duong/0000-0002-0438-3809; Luan, Pham Hoai/0000-0002-4272-0132; Nakashima, Yasuhiko/0000-0002-9457-5061; Tran, Thi Hong/0000-0002-2744-0079","Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) under a Strategic Basic Research Programs Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO) [JPMJPR20M6]","Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) under a Strategic Basic Research Programs Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO)","This work was supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) under a Strategic Basic Research Programs Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO) under Grant JPMJPR20M6.","","48","0","0","5","5","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","11830","11845","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3146148","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3146148","","","16","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","YR8QI","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000750254800001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We then quantify the decentralization degree using the clustering coefficient of our network models. We validate our approach through extensive simulations and analyze the decentralization degree with respect to network parameters such as the number of connections per node and the peer selection algorithm. Our results expose the trade-off between the average shortest path and the decentralization degree. Furthermore, we observe the impact of the average shortest path on the network speed and traffic overhead.

Applying different statistical tests (ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, and t-tests) and econometric methods (the modified cumulative abnormal return approach, regression analysis with dummy variables, and the trading simulation approach) to daily and weekly Bitcoin data over the period 2018-2021, the following hypotheses are tested: (H1) Expiration days create patterns in price behavior in the cryptocurrency market; and (H2) Price patterns can be exploited to generate abnormal profits from trading. The results suggest that expiration effects are only nominally present in the cryptocurrency market. There are differences in returns between expiration-related periods and average returns, but these differences are statistically insignificant. The only case in which an anomaly was detected was related to abnormally high returns during the week of expiration: returns during such weeks were positive in 65% of cases, and were on average 5 times higher than during usual weeks. Trading strategies based on this fact were able to generate results different from those of random trading, with a Sharpe ratio above 1. This is evidence in favor of the existence of a real price anomaly, which contradicts the efficient market hypothesis, and this could be implemented in the practice of traders and investors by creating trading strategies based on detected price effects or special technical analysis indicators to generate trading signals.

Second, the low entry barriers for merchants adopting cryptocurrencies to conduct transactions. Third, cryptocurrencies incurred zero overhead costs.

It has been revealed that in a broad sense, cryptocurrency is a new transaction technology that embodies the properties of money, goods, property, and financial assets but does not fully correspond to any of them. A cross-country analysis of the impact of changes in the economic and political situation on cryptocurrency and financial assets has confirmed a growing interest in investing in cryptocurrency, including institutional investors, which opens up the opportunity to become not just a speculative but also a protective investment asset.

Findings A systematic literature review of cryptocurrencies in behavioural finance seems to be timely and particularly important in terms of providing a guide for future research. Key topics include an extent review on the issue of herding behaviour amongst cryptocurrencies, momentum effects and overreaction, contagion effect, sentiment (investor's, market's) and uncertainty, along with studies related to investment decision-making, optimism bias, disposition, lottery and size effect. Originality/value The authors' survey paper complements recent papers in the area by offering a systematic account on the influence of behavioural factors on cryptocurrencies. Further, this study's purpose is not just to index the relevant literature, but rather to showcase and pinpoint several research areas that have emerged in the field of behavioural cryptocurrency research.

This method, while useful, does not properly control for the cross-correlations of the cryptocurrencies when computing aggregate spillovers from all others to any given cryptocurrency, whereas the joint spillover method of Lastrapes and Wiesen (2021) does. This paper further describes the novel multivariate conditioning sets employed by the joint spillover method. By employing these two techniques and evaluating the differences in the results, we demonstrate that controlling for the cross-correlations of cryptocurrencies matters for measuring aggregate spillovers and the overall connectedness of the cryptocurrency market. Using data on ten of the most traded cryptocurrencies, we find that the generalized spillover index overestimates overall connectedness by over nine percentage points relative to the new joint spillover index. This difference varies temporally and across cryptocurrencies.","[Wiesen, Thomas F.

Most cryptocurrencies are deployed in decentralized networks such as the blockchain, where they can be transferred from an address to another. However, anyone having access to the private key of an address can fully operate and steal the full balance of such address. Although brute-force attacks consume significant resources in terms of time and power, breaking one of the richest cryptocurrency addresses leads to a huge reward in terms of hard money. Therefore, an attacker may be incentivized to run this attack. In this paper, we run a statistical study of cryptocurrencies distribution over the richest addresses and assess the worthiness of a brute-force attack towards their public key. We consider an attacker investing a certain amount of hard money (i.e., a currency that is made up of or directly backed by a valuable commodity such as gold) to run the attack and propose a statistical characterization of the average gained reward. To further assess the worthiness of a brute-forcing attack, we compare the average reward with that of other probabilistic reward systems, such as mining and scratch cards. Results show that the average reward of the proposed attack is six orders of magnitude lower than that of mining and 10 orders of magnitude lower than that of scratching cards for a given initial investment.","[Brighente, Alessandro] Univ Padua, Dept Math, Padua, Italy; Univ Padua, HIT Res Ctr, Padua, Italy","","Brighente, A (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Math, Padua, Italy.","alessandro.brighente@unipd.it","Conti, Mauro/F-9145-2012","Conti, Mauro/0000-0002-3612-1934; Olivastri, Emilio/0000-0002-0003-5559","","","","","22","0","0","1","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-1647-4","","","","2022","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/PerComWorkshops53856.2022.9767441","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PerComWorkshops53856.2022.9767441","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BT3OS","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000821801200071","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Consequently, the cryptocurrency market can be a conducive arena for investors, as it offers many opportunities. However, it is difficult to understand. This study aims to describe, summarize, and segment the main trends of the entire cryptocurrency market in 2018, using data analysis tools. Accordingly, we propose a new clustering-based methodology that provides complementary views of the financial behavior of cryptocurrencies, and one that looks for associations between the clustering results, and other factors that are not involved in clustering. Particularly, the methodology involves applying three different partitional clustering algorithms, where each of them use a different representation for cryptocurrencies, namely, yearly mean, and standard deviation of the returns, distribution of returns that have not been applied to financial markets previously, and the time series of returns. Because each representation provides a different outlook of the market, we also examine the integration of the three clustering results, to obtain a fine-grained analysis of the main trends of the market. In conclusion, we analyze the association of the clustering results with other descriptive features of cryptocurrencies, including the age, technological attributes, and financial ratios derived from them. This will help to enhance the profiling of the clusters with additional descriptive insights, and to find associations with other variables. Consequently, this study describes the whole market based on graphical information, and a scalable methodology that can be reproduced by investors who want to understand the main trends in the market quickly, and those that look for cryptocurrencies with different financial performance.In our analysis of the 2018 and 2019 for extended period, we found that the market can be typically segmented in few clusters (five or less), and even considering the intersections, the 6 more populations account for 75% of the market. Regarding the associations between the clusters and descriptive features, we find associations between some clusters with volume, market capitalization, and some financial ratios, which could be explored in future research.","[Lorenzo, Luis; Arroyo, Javier] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Estudios Estadist Madrid, Madrid, Spain","","Lorenzo, L (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Estudios Estadist Madrid, Madrid, Spain.","luislore@ucm.es","Arroyo, Javier/K-3353-2014","Arroyo, Javier/0000-0001-6127-7538; Lorenzo, Luis/0000-0001-9059-0021","EIT Digital [825215]; European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST Action) [19130]","EIT Digital; European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST Action)(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST))","Funding was provided by EIT Digital (Grant no 825215) and European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST Action 19130).","","94","0","0","11","17","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","2199-4730","","FINANC INNOV","Financ.

Our static analysis reveals a moderate liquidity connectedness among our sample cryptocurrencies, whereas BTC and LTC play a significant role in connectedness magnitude. A distinct liquidity cluster is observed for BTC, LTC, and XRP, and ETH, XMR, and Dash also form another distinct liquidity cluster. The frequency domain analysis reveals that liquidity connectedness is more pronounced in the short-run time horizon than the medium- and long-run time horizons. In the short run, BTC, LTC, and XRP are the leading contributor to liquidity shocks, whereas, in the long run, ETH assumes this role. Compared with the medium term, a tight liquidity clustering is found in the short and long terms. The time-varying analysis indicates that liquidity connectedness in the cryptocurrency market increases over time, pointing to the possible effect of rising demand and higher acceptability for this unique asset.

For investors it is crucial to uncover the dependence relationships between cryptocurrencies for a more resilient portfolio diversification. Moreover, the stochastic behavior in both tails is important, as long positions are sensitive to a decrease in prices (lower tail), while short positions are sensitive to an increase in prices (upper tail). In order to assess both risk types, we develop in this paper a flexible copula model which is able to distinctively capture asymptotic dependence or independence in its lower and upper tails simultaneously. Our proposed model is parsimonious and smoothly bridges (in each tail) both extremal dependence classes in the interior of the parameter space. Inference is performed using a full or censored likelihood approach, and we investigate by simulation the estimators' efficiency under three different censoring schemes which reduce the impact of nonextreme observations. We also develop a local likelihood approach to capture the temporal dynamics of extremal dependence among pairs of leading cryptocurrencies. We here apply our model to historical closing prices of five leading cryotocurrencies which share large cryptocurrency market capitalizations. The results show that our proposed copula model outperforms alternative copula models and that the lower-tail dependence level between most pairs of leading cryptocurrencies and, in particular, Bitcoin and Ethereum has become stronger over time, smoothly transitioning from an asymptotic independence regime to an asymptotic dependence regime in recent years, whilst the upper tail has been relatively more stable overall at a weaker dependence level.","[Gong, Yan; Huser, Raphael] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, Comp Elect & Math Sci & Engn CEMSE Div, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","","Gong, Y (corresponding author), King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, Comp Elect & Math Sci & Engn CEMSE Div, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.","yan.gong@kaust.edu.sa; raphael.huser@kaust.edu.sa","","","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) [OSR-CRG2017-3434, OSR-CRG2020-4394]","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Office of Sponsored Research (OSR)","This publication is based upon work supported by the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Office of Sponsored Research (OSR) under Awards No. OSR-CRG2017-3434 and OSR-CRG2020-4394.","","48","0","0","1","1","INST MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS-IMS","CLEVELAND","3163 SOMERSET DR, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA","1932-6157","1941-7330","","ANN APPL STAT","Ann.

An implementation of this idea is called blockchain, which is a distributed protocol that allows the creation of an immutable ledger. While such an idea is very appealing, the ledger may be contaminated with incorrect, illegal, or even dangerous data, and everyone running the blockchain protocol has no option but to store and propagate the unwanted data. The ledger is bloated over time, and it is not possible to remove redundant information. Finally, missing data cannot be inserted later. Redactable blockchains were invented to allow the ledger to be mutated in a controlled manner. To date, redactable blockchains support at most two types of redactions: block modification and removal. The next logical step is to support block insertions. However, we show that this seemingly innocuous enhancement renders all previous constructs insecure. We put forward a model for blockchains supporting all three redaction operations and construct a blockchain that is provably secure under this formal definition.","[Dousti, Mohammad Sadeq] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Comp Sci, Fac Phys Math & Comp Sci, Mainz, Germany; [Kupcu, Alptekin] Koc Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Istanbul, Turkey","","Dousti, MS (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Comp Sci, Fac Phys Math & Comp Sci, Mainz, Germany.","modousti@uni-mainz.de","Küpçü, Alptekin/A-2224-2013","Küpçü, Alptekin/0000-0003-2099-2206","TUBITAK (the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) [119E088]","TUBITAK (the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK))","Alptekin Kupcu acknowledges support from TUBITAK (the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) under project 119E088.","","14","0","0","3","4","TUBITAK SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL TURKEY","ANKARA","ATATURK BULVARI NO 221, KAVAKLIDERE, ANKARA, 00000, TURKEY","1300-0632","1303-6203","","TURK J ELECTR ENG CO","Turk.

The sample period is April 2011 to April 2021, a period which saw substantial investments into the clean energy industry as the capital deployed to clean energy generation during this period was about three times higher than the preceding decade. The main results indicate statistically significant non-linear relationships among the markets under study. All energy metals, except cobalt, have a significant positive linkage with clean energy stock indices and such associations do hold during episodes of high volatility. While none of the energy metals under study acts as a hedge for clean energy stock markets, the results support previous evidence on the hedging properties of precious metals, showing that gold and silver serve as hedges for certain clean energy stock indices. These results have important implications amid tremendous growth in clean energy stock investments and the repeating occurrence of periods of uncertainty. (c) 2021 The Authors.

This article retheorizes scams as networked, collective activity. Scams, like all commerce, are shaped by and in turn shape communication channels. The network scam is therefore offered as a lens for understanding scams in the digital economy more broadly. As a case study, this article documents the 2017 Initial Coin Offering (ICO) Bubble. ICOs were supposed to be a new, radically disruptive way of crowdfunding to finance the development of a new, radically disruptive blockchain technological ecosystem. All told, ICOs raised an estimated $5 billion in 2017 alone. But by all analyses-both from observers and participants, both during the bubble and after-the vast majority of ICO turned out to be scams. This article uses these scams to theorize the network scam as a collaborative effort to bring about a shared future, but one that is fundamentally characterized by arbitrage on uneven belief among participants in that future ever coming to pass.","[Swartz, Lana] Univ Virginia, Media Studies, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA","","Swartz, L (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Wilson Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.","lanalana@gmail.com","","","","","","","59","0","0","0","0","SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD","LONDON","1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","1461-4448","1461-7315","","NEW MEDIA SOC","New Media Soc.","JUL","2022","24","7","","","","","1695","1713","","10.1177/14614448221099224","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/14614448221099224","","","19","Communication","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Communication","3A7BM","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000827410900009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

GHG emission reduction may visibly happen in areas of attention while other dirty businesses can grow in the shadow due to inconsistent carbon policies. This paper sheds light on the importance of integrated regulatory policies among cross markets to nail a tangible global impact on GHG emissions. The levelized cost of hydrogen production via grid-connected electrolysis is calculated at around 4 euro /kgH2 in Europe. The scenario-based analyses on the current markets indicate that investments in the water-splitting industries can be as attractive as BTC mining if the products are fully purchased at prices above 20 euro /kgH2. Such a deep economic chasm can be moderated by policymakers. Crypto Tax is introduced to interconnect the purchased price of hydrogen with the BTC market by tagging the coins regarding the mining origins. Cryptocurrency miners are obliged to provide dynamic subsidies for electrolyzers depending on their emission coefficients and the coin prices. Simulations confirm that the crypto tax leaves insignificant impacts when BTC falls below 10,000$; however, cryptocurrency rushes, like in 2020-2021, can be harnessed in favor of green hydrogen production. The efficacy of crypto tax is also showcased by Net Present Value (NPV) trajectories for BTC soaring up to 100,000$. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing on primary documents and participant observation, this article traces how the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) anticipates automation emanating from the growing integration of blockchain technologies in global governance. We find that promises of radical, rapid, and reckless automation advanced by promoters of Bitcoin and other 'defiant' applications of the technology are steered by this IO towards more incremental and carefully managed forms of automation. The OECD relies on two managerialist practices to anticipate reckless automation through the promotion of what we identify as responsible disruption. In combination, OECD practices of scenario building and shared orientation framework construction deepen and extend managerial forms of global governance today whose technocratic and expert-led nature limits democratic possibilities and perpetuates global inequalities.","[Campbell-Verduyn, Malcolm] Univ Duisburg Essen, Hamburger Kolleg Ctr Global Cooperat Res, Duisburg, Germany; [Campbell-Verduyn, Malcolm] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Huetten, Moritz] Darmstadt Business Sch, Darmstadt, Germany; [Huetten, Moritz] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands","","Campbell-Verduyn, M (corresponding author), Oude Kijk Int Jatstr 26, NL-9712 EK Groningen, Netherlands.","m.a.campbell-verduyn@rug.nl","","Campbell-Verduyn, Malcolm/0000-0003-1081-5417","","","","","78","0","0","1","1","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1360-0826","1469-798X","","GLOB SOC","Glob.

This agent uses a powerful feature space representation in the form of an echo state network, the output of which is made available to a direct, recurrent reinforcement learning agent. The agent learns to trade the XBTUSD (Bitcoin versus US Dollars) perpetual swap derivatives contract on BitMEX on an intraday basis. By learning from the multiple sources of impact on the quadratic risk-adjusted utility that it seeks to maximise, the agent avoids excessive over-trading, captures a funding profit, and can predict the market's direction. Overall, our crypto agent realises a total return of 350%, net of transaction costs, over roughly five years, 71% of which is down to funding profit.

Some ventures operationalize a hybrid of these two network types to enhance adoption of their blockchain platforms by broadening their base of stakeholders or facilitating interoperability between heterogeneous blockchains. In this article, we synthesize literature and industry writings to identify four hybrid blockchain architectures: hybrid blockchain approach, connected hybrid blockchain, interoperable blockchain architecture, and hard-forked blockchain for enterprise use. We then analyze these architectures along dimensions of semantic modeling support between private and public networks, data connectivity between networks, syntactic interoperability support between networks with heterogeneous codebases, governance model, and technical features. We find that hybrid blockchain ventures make trade-offs: support API's, tools, and customized development so that a codebase is useful for private and public networks or provide such support for interoperation between heterogeneous codebases. We then conduct a case study of an exemplar for a hybrid blockchain approach, the startup Insolar. We identify characteristics that have led Insolar to be idiosyncratically agile and effective in its blockchain development, which together with our architecture analysis may be timely and prescriptive as enterprises grow interested in addressing blockchain hybridity and interoperability.","[Kim, Henry M.; Turesson, Hjalmar; Laskowski, Marek] York Univ, Schulich Sch Business, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Kim, Henry M.; Turesson, Hjalmar; Laskowski, Marek] INSOLAR, CH-6312 Zug, Switzerland; [Bahreini, Amir Fard] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","","Kim, HM (corresponding author), York Univ, Schulich Sch Business, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.","hmkim@yorku.ca; hturesson@schulich.yorku.ca; marlas@yorku.ca; amir.fard@sauder.ubc.ca","","Fard Bahreini, Amir/0000-0002-5235-4703","","","","","90","3","3","15","15","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","0018-9391","1558-0040","","IEEE T ENG MANAGE","IEEE Trans.

As these hash functions employ the Merkle-Damgard (MD) construction, a preimage can be found with negligible memory. Since such calculations can be accelerated by dedicated ASICs, it has a potential risk of a so-called 51% attack. To address this issue, we propose a new PoW scheme based on the key recovery problem of cascade block ciphers. By choosing the appropriate parameters, e.g., block sizes and key sizes of underlying block ciphers, we can make this problem a memory-hard problem such that it requires a lot of memory to efficiently solve it. Besides, we can independently adjust the required time complexity and memory complexity, according to requirements by target applications and progress of computational power.","[Asanuma, Takaki; Isobe, Takanori] Univ Hyogo, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan","","Asanuma, T (corresponding author), Univ Hyogo, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan.","takaki.asanuma@gmail.com; takanori.isobe@ai.u-hyogo.ac.jp","",""," [KAKENHI 20K21795]","","Takanori Isobe is supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (Houga)(KAKENHI 20K21795) for the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.","","15","0","0","1","1","IEICE-INST ELECTRONICS INFORMATION COMMUNICATION ENGINEERS","TOKYO","KIKAI-SHINKO-KAIKAN BLDG, 3-5-8, SHIBA-KOEN, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-0011, JAPAN","1745-1361","","","IEICE T INF SYST","IEICE Trans.

The datasets used in this study are the actual closing prices and transaction volumes of 9 different cryptocurrencies, from the earliest time obtainable in Yahoo! Finance, all the way to 31 Oct 2021. Firstly, this paper presents a study of the severe drawbacks of all existing literature on FTS. In particular, this article outlines severe shortcomings of all existing FTS based algorithms that caused inaccuracies among all existing FTS-based algorithms in yielding meaningful prediction. Then, a novel structure of our improvised FTS, denoted as QFTS, is presented in this paper, which aims to rectify all flaws exist in all conventional FTS based models in literature. A further hybrid of QFTS with ANN is also presented. Later, a comparative analysis of all the aforementioned FTS models is presented in terms of overall forecasting accuracy and forecasting accuracy under specific conditions. The results are being compared in terms of MAPE. The newly invented QFTS model and the QFTS-ANN hybrid is found to profoundly outperform all the existing FTS models in literature, which includes Singh's FTS model. Such innovation profoundly rectifies severe shortcomings in financial forecasting that have persisted for many years in the past literature. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In response to such concerns digital coins that implement more energy efficient algorithms, e.g. Proof of Stake (PoS), have started to grow in popularity and some PoW based coins are planning to switch to PoS. We investigate linkages and transmission of price shocks across fourteen PoW and PoS/Other powered digital assets. PoW cryptocurrencies appear to be more strongly connected within the network of digital coins than are PoS/Other digital currencies. On average PoW coins export more uncertainty to other cryptocurrencies, while assets in both groups import similar levels of risk.

To address this issue, we propose a method for recoverable transactions that would replace the traditional transaction by allowing cryptoassets to be sent to a backup account address after a deadline has passed.

However, it's a challenge to store the large amount of data produced by blockchain. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce node storage overhead while ensuring node independence and data recoverability. This paper proposes to downsample these data to reduce the storage overhead of nodes. These nodes keep good independence, if downsampling follows the entropy of blockchain and the block bodies are continuously stored. Moreover, it demonstrates that the entire blockchain history can be efficiently recovered through the cooperative decoding of a group of nodes like fountain codes, if reserved data over these nodes obey the soliton distribution. However, these data on nodes are transparent (stored data are uncoded and can be used directly by the node without decoding). Thus, the proposed algorithm not only keeps decentralization and security, but also has good scalability in independence and recoverability.","[Huang, Qin; Quan, Li] Beihang Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shengli] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China","","Huang, Q (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.;Zhang, SL (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.","qhuang.smash@gmail.com; vquanli@163.com; zsl@szu.edu.cn","","Zhang, Shengli/0000-0002-7937-5870; Quan, Li/0000-0002-5832-2446","National Natural Science Foundation of China [62071026, 61941106, 62171291]; High Performance Computing (HPC) Resources at Beihang University","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); High Performance Computing (HPC) Resources at Beihang University","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62071026, 61941106, and 62171291.

However, no one is steering this development, or closely looking at the impacts that it may have on remote communities in the Arctic and Nordic region, a hotspot for datacenter development. Moreover, unlike other areas of energy consumption or technology adoption prone to rich, qualitative assessments, such work on datacenters involving local stakeholders and environmental concerns is less common, particularly at a larger scale. In this study, based on novel mixed methods-including corporate data, expert interviews, focus groups, and extensive site visits-across three countries, we offer a geographically and technologically bounded assessment looking at the sustainability impacts of datacenters on local communities. We ask: What impacts are occurring as part of datacenter development or planning proposals in Greenland, Iceland, and Norway? What is the actual and anticipated scale of those impacts on local Arctic communities? Finally, what impacts to datacenter development occur at the whole systems level? We examine not only impacts onsite at existing or proposed datacenters, but an entire range of consequences including the manufacturing of equipment, the laying of data cables, the construction of buildings, and issues of the dark web, cryptocurrency mining, hacking, spying, waste and decommissioning. Moreover, we humanize risks and benefits not only across scales, but also categorical types, including local impacts such as boom and bust cycles, the displacement of indigenous groups for land - particularly for power supply - and impacts on employment, especially after datacenters may close.","[Sovacool, Benjamin K.; Upham, Paul; Monyei, Chukwuka G.] Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit SPRU, Business Sch, Falmer, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Energy Technol, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Aarhus, Denmark","","Sovacool, BK (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit SPRU, Jubilee Bldg,Room 367, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.","B.Sovacool@sussex.ac.uk","; monyei, chukwuka/I-6553-2016","Upham, Paul/0000-0003-1998-4698; monyei, chukwuka/0000-0001-6958-708X","European Union [869327]","European Union(European Commission)","This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement no. 869327, Toward Just, Ethical and Sustainable Arctic Economies, Environments and Societies (JUSTNORTH).

We establish stationarity, ergodicity, and bounded moments of the data generated by our model. Furthermore, we obtain the consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. Given the parameter estimates in the model, the implied filter is capable of extracting the unobserved bubble process from the observed data.

In this research, we use a multivariate prediction approach and three different recurrent neural networks (RNNs), namely the long short-term memory (LSTM), the bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), and the gated recurrent unit (GRU). We also propose simple three layers deep networks architecture for the regression task in this study. From the experimental results on five major cryptocurrencies, i.e., Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Tether (USDT), and Binance Coin (BNB), we find that both Bi-LSTM and GRU have similar performance results in terms of accuracy.

But the way of abandoning historical data is hindered by the characteristic of blockchain-tamper-proof. To solve this problem, this dissertation takes bitcoin system as an example, and gives a definition of expired transaction. By abandoning expired transactions and packing the rest transactions in several blocks into a new substitute block to replace old blocks, help to overcome the difficulty in clearing historical data. However, this solution fails to clear ineffective intermediate transactions. Thus, a follow-up solution is proposed, abandon the transactions whose outputs have been run out and retain the transactions where not all the outputs have been spent. Additionally, include records of the spending details of each transaction output, which allows us to clear ineffective intermediate transactions. In the end, an experiment is conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the two solutions as to clearing transactions.","[Cao, Hongping] Guangzhou Huashang Coll, Sch Data Sci, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Cao, Hongxing] Guangzhou Nanfang Coll, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","","Cao, HP (corresponding author), Guangzhou Huashang Coll, Sch Data Sci, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.","","","","Innovation Team Project of Humanities and Social Sciences in Colleges and Universities of Guangdong Province [2020WCXTD008]","Innovation Team Project of Humanities and Social Sciences in Colleges and Universities of Guangdong Province","The study was supported by Innovation Team Project of Humanities and Social Sciences in Colleges and Universities of Guangdong Province (No. 2020WCXTD008).","","20","0","0","0","0","SCIENCE & INFORMATION SAI ORGANIZATION LTD","WEST YORKSHIRE","19 BOLLING RD, BRADFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE, 00000, ENGLAND","2158-107X","2156-5570","","INT J ADV COMPUT SC","Int.

This implies reliance on third parties called oracles when extrinsic data are needed for smart contracts. Oracle implementation, however, is still controversial and debated due to the reintroduction of trust and a single point of failure. The blindness to the real world also makes blockchains unable to communicate with each other, preventing any form of interoperability. This limitation prevents, for example, liquidity held in Bitcoin from flowing into DeFi applications. An early approach to the interoperability issue is constituted by wrapped tokens, representing blockchain native tokens issued on a non-native blockchain. Similar to how oracles reintroduce trust and a single point of failure, the issuance of wrapped tokens involves third parties whose characteristics need to be considered when evaluating the advantages of crossing-chains. This paper provides an overview of the available wrapped tokens and the main issuing procedures. Benefits, limitations, and implications for trust are listed and discussed.","[Caldarelli, Giulio] Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, I-37129 Verona, Italy","","Caldarelli, G (corresponding author), Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, I-37129 Verona, Italy.","giulio.caldarelli@univr.it","Caldarelli, Giulio/ABC-5351-2020","Caldarelli, Giulio/0000-0002-8922-7871","Emma Gianesini Fund","Emma Gianesini Fund","This research was funded by the Emma Gianesini Fund, managed by the UniCredit Foundation.","","88","2","2","3","3","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2078-2489","","INFORMATION","Information","JAN","2022","13","1","","","","","","","6","10.3390/info13010006","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info13010006","","","25","Computer Science, Information Systems","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Computer Science","ZC5NL","","Green Submitted, Green Published, gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000757566600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Given the technology's emphasis on purported immutable ledgers and trust-less sharing models, there has been a great deal of interest in applying blockchain to democratic reforms. From localized decision-making to national-scale voting systems, blockchain has spurred a surge of interest in how democracy might get a software update. While significant research exists on socio-technological imaginaries (perceptions) and potential applications (experiments) within the Global North, few studies have looked at more dynamic contexts, particularly Central Asia. In light of the violence surrounding elections in October 2020 and previous revolutions against the country's central government, the status of democracy in Kyrgyzstan is, at best, fragile and, at worst, non-existent.

Furthermore, since it has initially been popularized in Bitcoin, blockchain development has accelerated. Blockchain can be used to solve security challenges in the IoT. Making secure communication between IoT devices is one approach to accomplish this. To address this issue, we present an effective technique for intranetwork and internetwork device-to-device secure communication that enables IoT device identification and authentication while also providing secure communication in an open environment. The method also provides data integrity in addition to authentication and secure communication.

Each block contains the transactions offering the highest fee per Byte among those pending in the queue called Mempool. Various types of queueing models have been proposed to study this auction mechanism but most of them have some simplifying assumptions, e.g, fixed block capacity or stochastic stability of the system. In this work, we first propose a queueing model for the Mempool that takes into account the variable block capacity of real systems as well as the priority among the transactions due to the offered fees. We compare this more accurate model with those known in the literature. Then, we investigate a problem that received little attention from the literature: the transaction dropping. Indeed, when the workload intensity is higher than the maximum throughput (a very frequent situation in bitcoin network), miners need to evict some transactions from the Mempool. In this context, we investigate the relation between the dropping probability and the offered fee.","[Balsamo, Simonetta; Malakhov, Ivan; Marin, Andrea] Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Dept Env S Inf & Stat, Venice, Italy; [Mitrani, Isi] Univ Newcastle, Dept Comp, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England","","Balsamo, S (corresponding author), Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Dept Env S Inf & Stat, Venice, Italy.","balsamo@unive.it; ivan.malakhov@unive.it; marin@unive.it; isi.mitrani@newcastle.ac.uk","","","","","","","15","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-8729-0","","","","2022","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/MedComNet55087.2022.9810464","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MedComNet55087.2022.9810464","","","10","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BT8DW","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000852881400018","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Compared with traditional proof-of-work (PoW)-based blockchain systems like Bitcoin, EOSIO achieves a high transaction throughput and an alleged decentralization with the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus protocol. However, recent reports claimed the existence of voting collusion and manipulation during the DPoS consensus procedure of EOSIO, which may greatly decline the decentralization degree, fault tolerance, and reliability of the whole system. In this article, we obtain data from up to 135 000 000 blocks of EOSIO and conduct a data-driven decentralization analysis. Specifically, we characterize the decentralization evolution of the two phases in DPoS, namely block producer election and block production. Moreover, we study the voters with similar voting behaviors and propose methods to discover abnormal mutual voting behaviors in EOSIO. The analysis results show how EOSIO gradually evolves from decentralization to oligopoly and our methods can effectively capture abnormal voting phenomena in the EOSIO, which can also provide important insights for the design and maintenance of other DPoS-based blockchains.","[Liu, Jieli; Zheng, Zibin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Software Engn, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Weilin; Lu, Dingyuan; Wu, Jiajing] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China","","Wu, JJ (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.","wujiajing@mail.sysu.edu.cn","","Liu, Jieli/0000-0001-8158-3735","Development Program of Shandong Province [2021CXGC010108]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61973325]; Natural Science Foundations of Guangdong Province [2021A1515011661]; Technology Program of Guangzhou, China [202103050004]; Guangzhou Basic and Applied Basic Research Project [202102020616]","Development Program of Shandong Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundations of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Technology Program of Guangzhou, China; Guangzhou Basic and Applied Basic Research Project","This work was supported in part by the Development Program of Shandong Province under Grant 2021CXGC010108; in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61973325; in part by the Natural Science Foundations of Guangdong Province under Grant 2021A1515011661; in part by the Technology Program of Guangzhou, China, under Grant 202103050004; and in part by the Guangzhou Basic and Applied Basic Research Project under Grant 202102020616.","","45","0","0","0","0","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2329-924X","","","IEEE T COMPUT SOC SY","IEEE Trans.

It has been shown that a malicious mining pool in Bitcoin may attack other pools by sending some dummy miners who do not reveal true solutions but obtain reward portions from attacked pools. This result assumes that the infiltrating miners are always loyal and behave as the malicious pool desires; but why? In this work, we study rational infiltrating miners who behave by maximizing their own utilities. We characterize the infiltrating miners' optimal strategies for two kinds of betraying behaviors depending on whether they return to the original pool or not. Our characterizations show that the infiltrating miners' optimal strategy is simple and binary: they either betray or stay loyal all together, which depends on the total amount of them sent out by the malicious pool. Accordingly, we further compute the pool's optimal attacking strategy given the miners' strategic behaviors. Our experiments also show that by launching PBW attacks, the benefit to a pool is actually incremental.","[Yang, Ni] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chenhao] Beijing Normal Univ, Adv Inst Nat Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chenhao] BNU HKBU United Int Coll, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Li, Bo] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","","Wang, CH (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Adv Inst Nat Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.;Wang, CH (corresponding author), BNU HKBU United Int Coll, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.","niyang3-c@my.cityu.edu.hk; wangch@amss.ac.cn; comp-bo.li@polyu.edu.hk","","YANG, Ni/0000-0002-3755-2138","Hong Kong Polytechnic University [P0034420]","Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University)","This work is supported by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (Grant No. P0034420).","","23","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-97099-4; 978-3-030-97098-7","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2022","12874","","","","","","3","22","","10.1007/978-3-030-97099-4_1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-97099-4_1","","","20","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Mathematics","BT0EF","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000786715200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We pay attention to three features of cryptocurrency: it is a risky asset (because of frauds and hacks), which one acquires by bearing transaction costs, and its supply reaches its upper limit in a finite time (e.g., Bitcoin). We consider both the standard case with linear-quadratic utility functions and the more general case where utility functions are not specified. We find that the effect of an increase in cryptocurrency on the currency prices depends on the transaction costs that individuals bear to get cryptocurrency. In particular, when these costs are convex non-increasing in the quantity of cryptocurrency, the cryptocurrency price may increase with this quantity. Otherwise, when the transaction costs are either increasing or concave non-increasing, the cryptocurrency price decreases with the quantity of cryptocurrency. We also show that the cryptocurrency and the central bank currency prices always move in opposite directions. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Owing to its advantages of decentralization, consistency, and traceability, blockchain technology can be used to build an efficient and reliable IoT data sharing system. To facilitate the use of blockchain in IoT devices, we design a new slicing- and coding-based consensus algorithm (SCCA). The proposed consensus algorithm considers the storage optimization of the blockchain ledger. Specifically, the SCCA slices and encodes consensus resources and divides the blockchain nodes into different domains. It allows multiple domains to perform consensus concurrently and collaborate to store the blockchain ledger. Finally, we construct an experimental platform and evaluate the scheme. Experimental results reveal that the SCCA can increase throughput by more than five times and reduce communication costs by 95.7%, compared to the practical Byzantine fault tolerance method. In addition, the SCCA can reduce the storage cost of a single node to approximately 28.5% of that of the Bitcoin system.","[Chen, Pengge; Bai, Fenhua; Shen, Tao] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Informat Engn & Automat, Jingming South St, Kunming 650093, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Pengge; Bai, Fenhua; Shen, Tao] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Yunnan Key Lab Comp Technol Applicat, Jingming South St, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Gong, Bei] Beijing Univ Technol, Fac Comp Sci, Nanmofang St, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lei] Tongji Univ, Shanghai Res Inst Intelligent Autonomous Syst, Siping St, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Huang, Lin; An, Zhengyuan] Yunnan Prov Acad Sci & Technol, Dianchi St, Kunming 650051, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Mir, Talha] Balochistan Univ Informat Technol Engn & Manageme, Dept Elect Engn, Quetta 87300, Pakistan; [Tu, Shanshan] Beijing Univ Technol, Fac Informat Technol, Res Ctr Intelligent Percept & Autonomous Control, Nanmofang St, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China; [Waqas, Muhammad] Univ Bahrain, Coll Informat Technol, Comp Engn Dept, Sakhir 32038, Bahrain; [Waqas, Muhammad] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Engn, Perth, WA 6027, Australia","","Shen, T (corresponding author), Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Informat Engn & Automat, Jingming South St, Kunming 650093, Yunnan, Peoples R China.;Shen, T (corresponding author), Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Yunnan Key Lab Comp Technol Applicat, Jingming South St, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China.","cpg_007@163.com; bofenhua@stu.kust.edu.cn; shentao@kust.edu.cn; gongbei@bjut.edu.cn; reizhg@Tongji.edu.cn; 479587877@qq.com; 49708133@qq.com; talha.mir@buitms.edu.pk; sstu@bjut.edu.cn; engr.waqas2079@gmail.com","Chen, Peng/T-7500-2019","Chen, Peng/0000-0001-6122-0574; Waqas, Muhammad/0000-0003-0814-7544","Major Scientific and Technological Projects in Yunnan Province [202002AB080001-8]; Yunnan Key Laboratory of Blockchain Application Technology [202105AG070005, YNB202109, YNB202115]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61971208]; Yunnan Reserve Talents of Young and Middle-Aged Academic and Technical Leaders (Shen Tao) [2019HB005]; Yunnan Young Top Talents of Ten Thousands Plan [2018 73]","Major Scientific and Technological Projects in Yunnan Province; Yunnan Key Laboratory of Blockchain Application Technology; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Yunnan Reserve Talents of Young and Middle-Aged Academic and Technical Leaders (Shen Tao); Yunnan Young Top Talents of Ten Thousands Plan","This work was supported in part by the Major Scientific and Technological Projects in Yunnan Province under Grant 202002AB080001-8; in part by the Yunnan Key Laboratory of Blockchain Application Technology under Grant 202105AG070005 and Project YNB202109 and YNB202115; in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61971208; in part by the Yunnan Reserve Talents of Young and Middle-Aged Academic and Technical Leaders (Shen Tao) under Grant 2019HB005; and in part by the Yunnan Young Top Talents of Ten Thousands Plan (Shen Tao, Zhu Yan, Yunren Social Development) under Grant 2018 73.","","35","0","0","10","10","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1936-6442","1936-6450","","PEER PEER NETW APPL","Peer Peer Netw.

This study evaluates the dynamic price co-movement of main consumption categories within an Additive Bayesian Network (ABN) framework, which shows dramatically fluctuating price risks during the pandemic period. The global fears for COVID-19 affects price co-movements in China negatively with a direct linkage. By contrast, confirmed cases in China, confirmed cases around the world, and fears for the domestic pandemic situation are indirectly related with price co-movements through financial markets. The exchange rate and international hedging assets such as gold play important intermediary roles in such relationships. Meanwhile, volatile international markets including crude oil and Bitcoin are also indirectly linked with price changes in China. Comparing with the situation in China, the global pandemic appears to be a more important factor influencing the price stability in China. Overall, the impacts of COVID-19 on price co-movements are empirically demonstrated, which highlights the importance of prudent policies in response to the pandemic.","[Xu, Yingying] Beihang Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lien, Donald] Univ Texas San Antonio, Alvarez Coll Business, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA","","Lien, DA (corresponding author), Univ Texas San Antonio, Alvarez Coll Business, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.","Don.Lien@utsa.edu","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, China [71873014]","National Natural Science Foundation of China, China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","Acknowledgements We gratefully acknowledge the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, China (No. 71873014) .","","40","0","0","2","2","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1042-4431","1873-0612","","J INT FINANC MARK I","J.

The long-term prospects of cryptocurrencies remain uncertain; however, taking advantage of recent advances in neural networks and volatility, we show that the trading algorithms reinforced by short-term price predictions are bankable. Traditional trading algorithms and indicators are often based on mean reversal strategies that do not advantage price predictions. Furthermore, deterministic models cannot capture market volatility even after incorporating price predictions. Thus motivated by these issues, we integrate randomness in the price prediction models to simulate stochastic behavior. This paper proposes hybrid trading strategies that take advantage of the traditional mean reversal strategies alongside robust price predictions from stochastic neural networks. We trained stochastic neural networks to predict prices based on market data and social sentiment. The backtesting was conducted on three cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, for over 600 days from August 2017 to December 2019. We show that the proposed trading algorithms are better when compared to the traditional buy and hold strategy in terms of both stability and returns.","[Kalariya, Vasu; Parmar, Pushpendra; Jay, Patel; Tanwar, Sudeep] Nirma Univ, Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Ahmadabad 382481, Gujarat, India; [Raboaca, Maria Simona] Natl Res & Dev Inst Cryogen & Isotop Technol ICSI, Uzinei St 4, Ramnicu Valcea 240050, Romania; [Alqahtani, Fayez] King Saud Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Software Engn Dept, Riyadh 12372, Saudi Arabia; [Tolba, Amr] King Saud Univ, Community Coll, Comp Sci Dept, Riyadh 11437, Saudi Arabia; [Neagu, Bogdan-Constantin] Gheorghe Asachi Tech Univ Iasi, Dept Power Engn, Iasi 700050, Romania","","Tanwar, S (corresponding author), Nirma Univ, Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Ahmadabad 382481, Gujarat, India.;Raboaca, MS (corresponding author), Natl Res & Dev Inst Cryogen & Isotop Technol ICSI, Uzinei St 4, Ramnicu Valcea 240050, Romania.","17bce131@nirmauni.ac.in; 17bce098@nirmauni.ac.in; 17bce077@nirmauni.ac.in; sudeep.tanwar@nirmauni.ac.in; simona.raboaca@icsi.ro; fhalqahtani@ksu.edu.sa; atolba@ksu.edu.sa; bogdan.neagu@tuiasi.ro","Tanwar, Sudeep/AAI-6709-2020; Neagu, Bogdan Constantin/H-1685-2016; Raboaca, Maria Simona/K-5698-2019","Tanwar, Sudeep/0000-0002-1776-4651; Neagu, Bogdan Constantin/0000-0002-8413-0317; Raboaca, Maria Simona/0000-0002-7277-4377; Alqahtani, Fayez/0000-0001-8972-5953","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [RSP2022R509]","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University)","This research was funded by the Researchers Supporting Project No. (RSP2022R509) King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","","43","0","0","2","2","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-7390","","MATHEMATICS-BASEL","Mathematics","MAY","2022","10","9","","","","","","","1456","10.3390/math10091456","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math10091456","","","15","Mathematics","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Mathematics","1F0DW","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000794848300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, it is still necessary to consider the technical constraints that limit the large-scale application of blockchain: scalability, security, and decentralization cannot be achieved altogether. Consensus algorithm is the core of blockchain, which determines the performance of blockchain system to a certain extent. The existing reviews or surveys mainly focus on processes of consensus algorithms, but fall short in covering the current trends and scenarios, thereby lacking intrinsic understanding of their design philosophy. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional tradeoff model and unearth various indicators of different dimensions to guide the construction of consensus algorithms. To summarize the existing efforts, we compare and analyze various classical consensus algorithms, and focus on the design principles of these algorithms under the multi-dimensional tradeoff model. According to different requirements, each algorithm has different tradeoffs. Furthermore, we provide different solutions for blockchain in different dimensions. Finally, we summarize the development trend of consensus design and the key technology prospects of blockchain.

The evolving nature of the method allows continuous model update using stream interval data. The method employs participatory learning to cluster interval input data, assigns to each cluster a fuzzy rule, uses the weighted recursive least squares to update the parameters of the rule consequent intervals, and returns an interval-valued output. The efficacy of the method is evaluated in modeling and forecasting daily low and high prices of the two most traded cryptocurrencies, BitCoin and Ethereum. The forecast performance of the adaptive interval fuzzy modeling method is evaluated against classic autorregressive moving average, exponential smoothing state model, and the naive random walk. Results indicate that, similarly to with exchange rates, no model outperforms random walk in predicting prices in digital coin markets.

This article reviews the technological implementation of cryptocurrency and the security and stability of cryptocurrency and analyzes the security support from blockchain technology and its platforms based on empirical case studies. Our results show that the security support from blockchain technology platforms is significantly insufficient and immature. In addition, we further Zyskind and Nathan (2015) and Choi (2019) and find that the top ten platforms play critical roles in security support and have significant advantages in terms of funds, duration, and human resources. Moreover, these platforms provide computational resources and benefits to the consensus algorithm selection for blockchain practitioners. Second, encryption ensures the security of cryptocurrencies. On the one hand, the digital signatures identify the identity of the signatory and the transaction. However, the principle of the hash algorithm (SHA256) confirms ownership. Meanwhile, SHA256 is infeasible to compute in the reverse direction and is difficult to attack. Furthermore, the records in the blockchain can be queried by every participant, making the system information transparent and open reliable. Third, compared to the study of Fu and Fang 2016, we find that the blockchain structure is composed of security components and basic components of six layers that are independent and cannot be extended completely and have a certain coupling among them. Fourth, the underlying ledger structures of Bitcoin and DAG are highly correlated to their security. Specifically, we follow Sompolinsky et al. (2016) and detect that the structure of SPECTRE ensures network security and robustness from its block production, conflict resolution, and generated trusted transaction sets. Meanwhile, the voting algorithm of SPECTRE makes resolving conflicting transactions by calculating votes and ensuring the transaction information that is virtually unable to be tampered with possible. In particular, the security calculation power of SPECTRE can reach 51% and resist double-spend attacks and censorship attacks effectively. In addition, the RDL framework of SPECTRE achieves security confirmation of transferring funds. Moreover, PHANTOM identifies evil blocks by employing block connectivity analysis and ensures its security. Eventually, we also expand the studies of (Sompolinsky et al., 2016 and Sompolinsky et al., 2017) and compare the basic characteristics of the protocols of Bitcoin, SPECTRE, and PHANTOM and find that protocols play imperative roles throughout the implementation process of cryptocurrency. In addition, the underlying ledger structure and consensus mechanism make up a blockchain while the confirmation time, throughput limit, and ordering are prerequisites for smart contracts.","[Yu, Chao; Xie, Feiyu] Southeast Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China; [Yang, Wenke; He, Jianmin] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China; [Yang, Wenke] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Management Strategy & Innovat, Warmoesberg 26, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium","","Yang, WK (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China.;Yang, WK (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Management Strategy & Innovat, Warmoesberg 26, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.","wenkedyang@gmail.com","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71971055, 72173018]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The authors are grateful for the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71971055, 72173018).","","51","0","0","1","1","WILEY-HINDAWI","LONDON","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND","1076-2787","1099-0526","","COMPLEXITY","Complexity","JUL 1","2022","2022","","","","","","","","5835457","10.1155/2022/5835457","http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/5835457","","","15","Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Mathematics; Science & Technology - Other Topics","4M2EG","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000853139000002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Controversy remains regarding how environmental attention and public concerns adversely affect cryptocurrency prices. Therefore, the paper aims to introduce the index of cryptocurrency environmental attention (ICEA), which aims to capture the relative extent of media discussions surrounding the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies. (2) The impacts of cryptocurrency environmental attention on long-term macro-financial markets and economic development remain part of undeveloped research fields. Based on these factors, the paper will further examine the effects of the ICEA on financial markets or economic developments. Design/methodology/approach (1) The paper introduces a new index to capture cryptocurrency environmental attention in terms of the cryptocurrency response to major related events through gathering a large amount of news stories around cryptocurrency environmental concerns - i.e. >778.2 million news items from the LexisNexis News & Business database, which can be considered as Big Data - and analysing that rich dataset using variety of quantitative techniques. (2) The vector error correction model (VECM) and structural VECM (SVECM) [impulse response function (IRF), forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) and historical decomposition (HD)] are useful for characterising the dynamic relationships between ICEA and aggregate economic activities. Findings (1) The paper has developed a new measure of attention to sustainability concerns of cryptocurrency markets' growth, ICEA. (2) ICEA has a significantly positive relationship with the UCRY indices, volatility index (VIX), Brent crude oil (BCO) and Bitcoin. (3) ICEA has a significantly negative relationship with the global economic policy uncertainty (GlobalEPU) and global temperature uncertainty (GTU). Moreover, ICEA has a significantly positive relationship with the industrial production (IP) in the short term, whilst having a significantly negative relationship in the long term. (4) The HD of the ICEA displays higher linkages between environmental attention, Bitcoin and UCRY indices around key events that significantly change the prices of digital assets. Research limitations/implications The ICEA is significant in the analysis of whether cryptocurrency markets are sustainable regarding energy consumption requirements and negative contributions to climate change. Understanding of the broader impacts of cryptocurrency environmental concerns on cryptocurrency market volatility, uncertainty and environmental sustainability should be considered and developed. Moreover, the paper aims to point out future research and policy legislation directions. Notably, the paper poses the question of how cryptocurrency can be made more sustainable and environmentally friendly and how governments' cryptocurrency policies can address the cryptocurrency markets. Practical implications (1) The paper develops a cryptocurrency environmental attention index based on news coverage that captures the extent to which environmental sustainability concerns are discussed in conjunction with cryptocurrencies. (2) The paper empirically investigates the impacts of cryptocurrency environmental attention on other financial or economic variables [cryptocurrency uncertainty (UCRY) indices, Bitcoin, VIX, GlobalEPU, BCO, GTU index and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development IP index]. (3) The paper provides insights into making the most effective use of online databases in the development of new indices for financial research. Social implications Whilst blockchain technology has a number of useful implications and has great potential to transform several industries, issues of high-energy consumption and CO2 pollution regarding cryptocurrency have become some of the main areas of criticism, raising questions about the sustainability of cryptocurrencies. These results are essential for both policy-makers and for academics, since the results highlight an urgent need for research addressing the key issues, such as the growth of carbon produced in the creation of this new digital currency. The results also are important for investors concerned with the ethical implications and environmental impacts of their investment choices. Originality/value (1) The paper provides an efficient new proxy for cryptocurrency and robust empirical evidence for future research concerning the impact of environmental issues on cryptocurrency markets. (2) The study successfully links cryptocurrency environmental attention to the financial markets, economic developments and other volatility and uncertainty measures, which has certain novel implications for the cryptocurrency literature. (3) The empirical findings of the paper offer useful and up-to-date insights for investors, guiding policy-makers, regulators and media, enabling the ICEA to evolve into a barometer in the cryptocurrency era and play a role in, for example, environmental policy development and investment portfolio optimisation.","[Wang, Yizhi; Lucey, Brian] Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Business Sch, Dublin, Ireland; [Lucey, Brian] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Inst Business Res, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Lucey, Brian] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Ind Econ, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Vigne, Samuel Alexandre] LUISS Univ, LUISS Business Sch, Rome, Italy; [Yarovaya, Larisa] Univ Southampton, Ctr Digital Finance, Southampton, Hants, England","","Wang, YZ (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Business Sch, Dublin, Ireland.","wangy27@tcd.ie","","Lucey, Brian/0000-0002-4052-8235; Yarovaya, Larisa/0000-0002-9638-2917","China Scholarship Council [202008300011]","China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of The China Scholarship Council (project code: 202008300011).

As such, the rapid adoption of IoT devices has resulted in a large number of low-powered devices integrating into traditional communication networks and influencing practically all assets of everyday life. However, the integration of IoT devices into traditional networks comes at a price, often in the form of added security challenges or administrative complexity. Some of these challenges may be addressed by leveraging technology developed from an unlikely source, crypto currencies. Crypto currencies introduced the notion of a blockchain, which is comprised of several underlying technologies that may be combined with IoT protocols to enable secure mechanisms for reaping the benefits of IoT devices. This paper introduces key challenges in securing IoT devices as well as important components of blockchain technology that may contain the keys to addressing these challenges. Emerging IoT security solutions are identified and evaluated based on their assessed effectiveness.","[Bryant, Blake; Saiedian, Hossein] Univ Kansas, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Saiedian, Hossein] Univ Kansas, Inst Informat Sci Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","","Saiedian, H (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.","saiedian@ku.edu","","Saiedian, Hossein/0000-0001-5060-6332","","","","","36","0","0","0","0","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2475-6725","","","SECUR PRIVACY","Secur.

This is because parties that distrust each other can make secure transactions without the oversight of a central authority. The first consensus protocol emerged with Bitcoin. Since then, many others have appeared. Some of them have been implemented by official blockchain platforms, whereas others, for the time being, remain as proposals. A blockchain consensus is a trade-off. The new solutions promise to overcome the known drawbacks of blockchain, but they may also bring new vulnerabilities. Moreover, blockchain performance metrics are not clearly defined, as some metrics, such as delay and throughput, which are key factors for the efficiency of standard networks, are purposely constrained by most mainstream blockchain platforms. The main body of this paper consolidates knowledge of blockchains, focusing on the seminal consensus protocols in large-scale market capitalization platforms, and how consensus is achieved for large-scale, decentralized, blockchain architectures. The benefits, limitations, and tradeoffs, as well as the subsequent trend in current consensus development, and its limitations as a general paradigm, are highlighted. The paper also sheds light on overlooked potential performance metrics, and it proposes some novel solutions to some of the identified problems.","[Merrad, Yacine; Habaebi, Mohamed Hadi; Islam, Md Rafiqul; Gunawan, Teddy Surya] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Kuala Lupur 53100, Malaysia; [Elsheikh, Elfatih A.

However, sidechains suffer from significant challenges such as centralization, inefficiency and insecurity, meaning that they are rarely used in practice. In this paper, we present SEPoW, a secure and efficient sidechains construction that is suitable for proof of work (PoW) sidechain systems. The drawbacks for the centralized exchange of cross-chain assets in the participating blockchains are overcome by our decentralized SEPoW. To reduce the size of a cross-chain proof, we introduce merged mining into our SEPoW such that the proof consists of two Merkle tree paths regardless of the size of the current blockchain. We prove that the proposed SEPoW achieves the desirable security properties that a secure sidechains construction should have. As an exemplary concrete instantiation we propose SEPoW for a PoW blockchain system consistent with Bitcoin. We evaluate the size of SEPoW proof and compare it with the state-of-the-art PoW sidechains protocols. Results demonstrate that SEPoW achieves a proof size of 416 bytes which is roughly 123x, 510x and 62000x smaller than zkRelay proof, PoW sidechains proof and BTCRelay proof, respectively.","[Li, Taotao; Wang, Mingsheng; Deng, Zhihong; Liu, Dongdong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, State Key Lab Informat Secur, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Li, Taotao; Wang, Mingsheng; Liu, Dongdong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Cyber Secur, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","","Li, TT (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, State Key Lab Informat Secur, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.;Li, TT (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Cyber Secur, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.","litaotao@iie.ac.cn; wangmingsheng@iie.ac.cn; dengzhihong@iie.ac.cn; liudongdong@iie.ac.cn","","","Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program [2019JZZY020127]","Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers of ICA3PP 2021 for their insightful suggestions.

Sequential decision making and Markov decision processes are rather suited for this type of application. Through trial and error based on historical data, an agent can learn the characteristics of the market and evolve an algorithm to maximize the cumulative returns. In this work, we propose a novel RL trading algorithm utilizing random perturbation of the Q-network and account for the more realistic nonlinear transaction costs. In summary, we first design a new near-quadratic transaction cost function considering the slippage. Next, we develop a convolutional deep Q-learning network (CDQN) with multiple price input based on this cost functions. We further propose a random perturbation (rp) method to modify the learning network to solve the instability issue intrinsic to the deep Q-learning network. Finally, we use this newly developed CDQN-rp algorithm to make trading decisions based on the daily stock prices of Apple (AAPL), Meta (FB), and Bitcoin (BTC) and demonstrate its strengths over other quantitative trading methods.","[Zhu, Tian; Zhu, Wei] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","","Zhu, T (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.","tian.zhu@stonybrook.edu; wei.zhu@stonybrook.edu","","","","","","","20","1","1","0","0","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2571-905X","","STATS-BASEL","Stats","JUN","2022","5","2","","","","","546","560","","10.3390/stats5020033","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/stats5020033","","","15","Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Statistics & Probability","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Mathematics","3V1II","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000841414100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Crypto-payment is one such application that can bring radical changes to financial transactions in many industries, particularly e-commerce and online retail. However, characteristics of the technology such as transaction disintermediation, lack of central authority, and lack of adequate regulations may introduce new privacy and security concerns among the users. This coincides with another trend of rising individuals' concerns pertaining to information privacy and security issues in online transactions. The current paper investigates how consumer trust in crypto-payment, a key determinant of consumer intentions and relational exchanges over the long-term, is formed based on their perceptions towards privacy and security aspects of the technology. Using data from 327 survey participants, the study found that perceived information privacy risk, perceived anonymity, and perceived traceability of transactions are significant determinants of consumer trust in crypto-payment; but their perceptions of information security fraud risk have no significant effect. It also provided support for the hypothesis that perceived trust contributes to consumers' intention to adopt crypto-payment. The findings highlight the need to enhance consumer understanding and awareness of information privacy and potential security issues in crypto-payment as well as what needs to be done to address consumer concerns in this regard. The paper creates novel insights into the requirements of trust in crypto-payment services and the consequences of consumers' perceptions of privacy and security in this domain.","[Mashatan, Atefeh; Sangari, Mohamad Sadegh] Toronto Metropolitan Univ, Ted Rogers Sch Management, Cybersecur Res Lab, Ryerson Univ, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada; [Dehghani, Milad] Univ Coll Cork, Cork Univ Business Sch, Cork T12 CY82 21, Ireland","","Mashatan, A (corresponding author), Toronto Metropolitan Univ, Ted Rogers Sch Management, Cybersecur Res Lab, Ryerson Univ, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada.","amashatan@ryerson.ca","","Sangari, Mohamad Sadegh/0000-0002-1769-4278","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada; Ted Rogers School of Management Research Development Grant","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Ted Rogers School of Management Research Development Grant","This work was supported in part by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada and in part by the Ted Rogers School of Management Research Development Grant.","","110","0","0","2","2","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","69441","69454","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3186786","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3186786","","","14","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","3Q7QG","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000838420300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It categorizes scientific technology changes in the 4IR based on related research, and identifies six factors and corresponding research hypotheses. The paths for the six hypotheses were analyzed using 275 effective samples. Results show that life-convenience technology and blockchain technology variables significantly influenced employment (p < 0.001). Additionally, innovation technology, interface technology, human life technology, and 3D technology variables significantly influenced employment (p < 0.01). The power of the total variance explanation (69.596%) for the employment influence was very high. Seven items-self-driving cars, decision-making using big data, Internet of Things, Wearable Internet, Designer Beings, 3D printing technology and human health, and Bitcoin and blockchain-were statistically significant for the employment effect. The study obtained effective paths for the employment influence of fundamental technologies and derived the demographic variable presenting a meaningful difference among groups. This research seeks a policy direction that enables preparation for 4IR deployment. It also contributes to the academic sphere in meaningfully and empirically classifying the technology factors of the 4IR.","[Ahn, Jongchang; Rhee, Yoonki] Hanyang Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Seoul 04764, South Korea; [Jang, Yirang] Off Small & Medium Business Ombudsman, Seoul 30171, South Korea","","Rhee, Y (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Seoul 04764, South Korea.;Jang, YR (corresponding author), Off Small & Medium Business Ombudsman, Seoul 30171, South Korea.","yr0317@korea.kr; boongfa@hanyang.ac.kr","","Rhee, Yoonki/0000-0003-0749-8289","","","","","51","0","0","3","3","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2071-1050","","SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL","Sustainability","AUG","2022","14","16","","","","","","","9903","10.3390/su14169903","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14169903","","","21","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","4A6WZ","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000845240200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This work focuses on the main category (crypto-ransomware) of ransomware attacks, making the victim's data impossible to recover once it has been encrypted. It encrypts its victim's files with an encryption algorithm and tries to extort a ransom from the victim. To identify a crypto-ransomware attack at the pre-encryption level, the authors propose a Pre-Encryption and Identification Technique (PEI). Firstly, PEI provides early identification of ransomware. The detection stage uses a signature comparison against the signatures of known crypto-ransomware to detect ransomware before it can be triggered. For reliable file comparison, a Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA-256) signature was generated. Secondly, a detection stage based on a Learning Algorithm (L.A.) consisting of discretization and prediction using a random forest model finds crypto-ransomware through pre-encryption Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). APIs pattern recognition helps the learning algorithm identify crypto-ransomware from suspicious programs. The proposed PEI achieved 97.7% recall and detected both known and unknown crypto-ransomware even before they were implemented.","[Mantri, Aditya] Motilal Nehru Natl Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Prayagraj 211004, India; [Singh, Navjot] Indian Inst Informat Technol Allahabad, Dept Informat Technol, Prayagraj 211015, India; [Kumar, Krishan] Natl Inst Technol Uttarakhand, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Srinagar 246174, India; [Dahiya, Sanjay] Ch Devi Lal State Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Panniwala Mota 125077, India","","Mantri, A (corresponding author), Motilal Nehru Natl Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Prayagraj 211004, India.","amantri7@gmail.com; navjot@iiita.ac.in; kkberwal@nituk.ac.in; sanjaydahiyakkr@gmail.com","Kumar, Krishan/AAC-3473-2020; Singh, Navjot/I-5444-2017","Kumar, Krishan/0000-0002-7068-6541; Singh, Navjot/0000-0003-0409-8482","Department of Science & Technology (DST), India; DST [DST/ICPS/Cluster/CS Research/2018 (General)]","Department of Science & Technology (DST), India(Department of Science & Technology (India)); DST(Department of Science & Technology (India))","The authors express their gratitude to the Department of Science & Technology (DST), India, for the obtained financial support in performing this research work.

However, the lack of scalability and heavy resource requirements of initial blockchain designs hinder the integration, and it is unclear how consumer devices will be adopting cryptocurrency. Therefore, in this article, we critically review the existing integration approaches and cryptocurrency designs that strive to enable micropayments among consumer devices. We identify and discuss solutions under three main categories; direct integration, payment channel network, and new cryptocurrency design. The first approach utilizes a full node to interact with the payment system. Offline channel payment is suggested as a second-layer solution to solve the scalability issue and enable instant payment with low fee. New designs converge to semicentralized scheme and focus on lightweight consensus protocol that does not require high computation power. We evaluate the pros and cons of each of these approaches and then point out future research challenges.

Here, a database named ledger is fully replicated on every node, which is a chain of blocks. Each block is composed of transactions and is appended to the ledger at each node. Nodes may tamper with transactions, i.e. nodes suffer from Byzantine faults. Consensus protocols tolerant to Byzantine faults are required to make every replica of the ledger mutually consistent. In one approach, consensus protocols like PoW (Proof of Work) are proposed. However, nodes consume large energy to make a consensus. In another approach, the PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant) protocols are proposed in order to reduce the computation and communication overheads in scalable systems. Here, a leader node plays a role of centralized coordinator. However, the leader node consumes larger computation resources to communicate with member nodes. In this paper, we newly propose a DBFT (Decentralized BFT) protocol. Here, a leader node divides a proposal on a new block to smaller segments, each of which is sent to a subleader. The DBFT protocol is composed of three phases, prepare, precommit, and commit ones.

The move towards resource-demanding services, which are part of the 5G evolution, further exacerbates its necessity, as the cost of ownership is often not matched by an increase in revenue. In parallel, the recent emergence of network function virtualization is creating new business opportunities and business models that challenge conventional centralized network ownership. In this work, we address the issue of optical access network sharing, addressing the challenging scenario of the untrusted broadband market. We propose, for the first time, to our knowledge, a distributed market scheme for capacity sharing that makes use of permissioned blockchain technology in multi-tenant passive optical networks. The blockchain is used as a verification mechanism that runs in parallel to shared, market-based capacity scheduling operations. To study the feasibility and performance of the proposed verification layer, we have developed a smart contract (chaincodes) using the Hyperledger Fabric permissioned blockchain platform that solves the high transaction cost and energy consumption concerns associated with permissionless blockchain solutions used in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

We all are aware that data constitute our wealth and our currency; vulnerability and security become even more significant and a vital point of concern for healthcare. Recent cyberattacks have raised the questions of planning, requirement, and implementation to develop more cyber-secure models. This paper is based on a blockchain that classifies network participants into clusters and preserves a single copy of the blockchain for every cluster. The paper introduces a novel blockchain mechanism for secure healthcare sector data management, which reduces the communicational and computational overhead costs compared to the existing bitcoin network and the lightweight blockchain architecture. The paper also discusses how the proposed design can be utilized to address the recognized threats.

In this article, we propose a novel paradigm for smart contract execution. It distinguishes between consensus nodes and execution nodes: different groups of execution nodes can execute transactions in parallel; meanwhile, consensus nodes can asynchronously order transactions and process execution results. Moreover, it requires no coordination among execution nodes and can effectively prevent livelocks. We show two ways of applying this paradigm to blockchains. First, we show how we can make Ethereum support parallel and asynchronous contract execution without hard-forks. Then, we propose a new public, permissionless blockchain. Our benchmark shows that, with a fast consensus layer, it can provide a high throughput even for complex transactions like Cryptokitties gene mixing.

It then attempts to explain the comovement with the rational investment theory by examining whether it is driven by market uncertainty measures, public attention to COVID-19, and the government's containment and health responses to COVID-19. Wavelet Coherence heatmaps show that the stock-cryptocurrency comovements increase significantly and positively during the pandemic, indicating that cryptocurrencies lose their safe haven properties against stocks during the heightened market uncertainties. Over the longer investment horizons, Bitcoin reemerges as a safe haven or strong hedger while Ethereum's properties weaken. Seemingly Unrelated Regression results reveal that the stock-cryptocurrency comovements are rationally explained by market uncertainties, government responses to COVID-19, and market fundamentals. However, the comovements are also driven by the fear of COVID-19 to a certain extent. Our findings offer valuable insights for investors considering cryptocurrencies to rebalance their equity portfolios during market distress.

Besides the economical aspect, the technological capabilities of Blockchain such as distributed computing, record keeping, irrecoverability of transactions, reliability and etc., are harnessed by variety of real-world applications. Blockchain is a rising pool of records known as blocks linked using security procedure. It is typically managed by a group of nodes in a distributed network technology which integrates technologies such as distributed ledger, security and consensus algorithm to ensure reliability and immutability. In Blockchain, the access privileges are determined by a set of nodes called miners, which run the consensus algorithm to access and submit transactions in to the block after authentication. However, in the existing Blockchain, there is no mechanism to ensure the trust and robustness of the miners and eliminate the malicious miners which runs the consensus algorithm. Therefore, this paper proposes a trust model with an objective of eliminating untrusted nodes from the mining process to enhance the reliability and security of the Blockchain. Further, the proposed trust model is suitably analysed for transaction rate, efficiency and scalability with Hyper Ledger framework to ensure the robustness.","[Shalini, R.] Pondicherry Engn Coll, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Pondicherry, India; [Manoharan, R.] Pondicherry Engn Coll, Comp Sci & Engn, Pondicherry, India","","Shalini, R (corresponding author), Pondicherry Engn Coll, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Pondicherry, India.","shalinir856@gmail.com","","","","","","","15","0","0","3","6","INST COMPUTER SCIENCES, SOCIAL INFORMATICS & TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENG-ICST","GHENT","BEGIJNHOFLAAN 93, GHENT, 90000, BELGIUM","2032-9407","","","EAI ENDORSED TRANS S","EAI Endorsed Trans.

Since enclaves lose their state when closed, that state has to be sealed, i.e., cryptographically protected with a secret key, and stored outside the enclave boundary. In SGX, the used key is bound to both the enclave and the processor that sealed the data, so it is unfeasible for any enclave in another computer to derive the same secret key to unseal such data. This offers security to the data, but also makes it impossible to recover that data if the original computer is damaged or stolen. In order to support backup and recovery of data sealed by enclaves, we propose SRX, a solution for sharing sealed data amongst a restricted set of SGX-enabled computers executing the same enclave code. Enclaves using SRX have access to common keys to seal and unseal enclave data, allowing the sharing of sealed data among the trusted domain. SRX guarantees that these secret keys are never exposed outside the trusted domain. SRX was implemented and evaluated with two applications: a bitcoin wallet and a password manager.","[Andrade, Daniel; Silva, Joao; Correia, Miguel] Univ Lisbon, INESC ID Inst Super Tecn, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal","","Correia, M (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, INESC ID Inst Super Tecn, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.","miguel.p.correia@tecnico.ulisboa.pt","Silva, Joao Nuno/L-6872-2015; Correia, Miguel/L-6890-2015","Silva, Joao Nuno/0000-0002-7969-5487; Correia, Miguel/0000-0001-7873-5531","European Commission [870635]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT) [UIDB/50021/2020]; Instituto Superior Tecnico (IST), Universidade de Lisboa (ULisboa); Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores-Investigacao e Desenvolvimento (INESC-ID)","European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)(Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission); Instituto Superior Tecnico (IST), Universidade de Lisboa (ULisboa); Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores-Investigacao e Desenvolvimento (INESC-ID)","This work was supported in part by the European Commission under Contract 870635 (DE4A); in part by national funds through Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT) under Grant UIDB/50021/2020; and in part by the Instituto Superior Tecnico (IST), Universidade de Lisboa (ULisboa), and the Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores~Investigacao e Desenvolvimento (INESC-ID).","","61","0","0","1","1","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","35901","35918","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3162489","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3162489","","","18","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","0O4VK","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000783525500001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A promising solution to this issue is payment channels, which allow unlimited numbers of atomic and trust-free payments between two peers without exhausting the resources of the blockchain. A linked payment channel network enables payments between two peers without direct channels through a series of intermediate nodes that forward and charge for the transactions. However, the charging strategies of intermediate nodes vary with different payment channel networks. Existing works do not yet have a complete routing algorithm to provide the most economical path for users in a multi-charge payment channel network. In this work, we propose MPCN-RP, a general routing protocol for payment channel networks with multiple charges. Our extensive experimental results on both simulated and real payment channel networks show that MPCN-RP significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms in terms of time and fees.","[Chen, Yanjiao; Ran, Yuyang; Zhou, Jingyue; Zhang, Jian; Gong, Xueluan] Wuhan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China","","Zhang, J; Gong, XL (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.","jzhang@whu.edu.cn; xueluangong@whu.edu.cn","","Gong, Xueluan/0000-0003-2190-8117; Zhang, Jian/0000-0003-3612-7989; Chen, Yanjiao/0000-0002-1382-0679","NSFC [61972296]; Wuhan Applied Fundamental Research [2019010701011419]","NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Wuhan Applied Fundamental Research","This work was supported in part by the NSFC under Grant 61972296, and in part by the Wuhan Applied Fundamental Research under Project 2019010701011419.","","40","0","0","4","4","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","1932-4537","","","IEEE T NETW SERV MAN","IEEE Trans.

Estimating the variance function normally proceeds in two steps: estimating the conditional mean model, then using the residuals to estimate the variance function. In this article, a non-parametric approach is proposed to estimate the complicated parametric conditional mean model in the first step. The approach turns out to provide a convenient solution to the problem and achieve robustness to any structural break features in the conditional mean model without the need of estimating them parametrically. In the second step, kernel-smoothed squares of the truncated first-step residuals are shown to consistently estimate the variance function. In Monte Carlo simulations, we show that our proposed method performs very well in the presence of explosive and stationary collapse segments compared with the popular rolling standard deviation estimator that is commonly used in economics and finance. As an empirical illustration of our new approach, we apply the volatility estimator to recent Bitcoin data.","[HARVEY, D. A. V. I. D. I.; LEYBOURNE, S. T. E. P. H. E. N. J.; ZU, Y. A. N.

Nowadays, complex computations and data analytic tasks can be outsourced to specialized third parties. However, data owners might be reluctant to share their data especially when it includes sensitive information. Therefore, a need for privacy-preserving machine learning applications cannot be overstated. We present FHSVM: a Fast Homomorphic evaluation of non-linear SVM prediction on encrypted data using Fully Homomorphic Encryption. We provide design, implementation and several algorithmic and architectural optimizations such as novel packing strategies and parallel implementation to achieve real-time private prediction. We employed the CKKS FHE scheme to implement FHSVM under 128-bit security level. We evaluated FHSVM on a contemporary real-world large dataset compiled for anti-money laundering tasks in Bitcoin transactions. Empirical analysis demonstrates that homomorphic SVM prediction can be performed in 1.25 s on multi-core CPU platforms. In addition, FHSVM shows zero accuracy loss when compared to the non-privacy-preserving implementation. This shows that FHSVM is both computationally secure and fully utilizes the data.","[Al Badawi, Ahmad; Vig, Saru] Rabdan Acad, Homeland Secur, Dhafeer St, Abu Dhabi 114646, U Arab Emirates; [Chen, Ling] Inst Infocomm Res, Cybersecur, 1 Fusionopolis Way, Singapore 138632, Singapore","","Al Badawi, A (corresponding author), Rabdan Acad, Homeland Secur, Dhafeer St, Abu Dhabi 114646, U Arab Emirates.","aalbadawi@ra.ac.ae; Ling_Chen@i2r.a-star.edu.sg; Saru_Vig@i2r.a-star.edu.sg","","Al Badawi, Ahmad/0000-0001-7759-7368","A*STAR under its RIE2020 Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering (AME) Programmatic Programme [A19E3b0099]; Rabdan Academy","A*STAR under its RIE2020 Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering (AME) Programmatic Programme(Agency for Science Technology & Research (ASTAR)); Rabdan Academy","Ahmad Al Badawi was supported by Rabdan Academy.

In order to obtain the higher revenue, the rational mining pool usually chooses an infiltration attack, that is, the pool will falls into the mining dilemma of the PoW consensus algorithm. Thus the article proposes to apply zero-determinant strategies for optimizing the behavior selection of the mining pool under PoW consensus mechanism to increase the total revenues of the system, so as to solve the mining dilemma. After theoretically studying the set and extortionate strategy of zero-determinant, the article devises an adaptive zero-determinant strategy that the pool can change the corporation probability of the next round based on its previous revenues. To verify the effectiveness of zero-determinant strategies, based on the actual revenue of the mining pool defined and deduced in the paper, it simulates 30 sets of game strategies to illustrate the revenue variation of the mining pools. The simulation results show that the three zero-determinant strategies can effectively improve the convergence rate of cooperation, mitigate block withholding attack and maximize the total revenues of the system. Compared with the set and extortionate strategy, the adaptive strategy can ensure more stability and more revenue.","[Ren, Min; Guo, Hongfeng] Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Math, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhihao] Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management & Engn, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China","","Ren, M (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Math, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.","rm_sd@163.com","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61502151]; Shandong Key R&D (Major Scientific and Technological Innovation) Project of China [2021CXGC010108]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shandong Key R&D (Major Scientific and Technological Innovation) Project of China","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61502151) and the Shandong Key R&D (Major Scientific and Technological Innovation) Project of China (No. 2021CXGC010108).

This paper examines blockchain imaginaries and associated metaphors. Our analysis focuses on bitcoin and ethereum, today's most prominent blockchains that use the proof-of-work consensus mechanism. We identify three principles that organise blockchain imaginaries: substantial, morphological, and structural. These principles position blockchain as an enabler of economic, political and epistemological practices, respectively. Blockchain infrastructure and protocols rely on substantial metaphors (e.g. gold, gas) to govern resource allocation, morphological metaphors (e.g. work, trust) to generate consensus and structural metaphors (e.g. chain, transaction) to establish shared knowledge. Those imaginaries rely on metaphorical displacements of meaning that make blockchain technology relevant and intelligible while simultaneously shaping the direction of technological development and positing these technologies as new forms of economic, political and epistemological organisation. They are not merely descriptive but performative. We conclude by showing how these principles partially overlap with three symbolically generalized media: money, power and truth.

Blockchain, a technology that was born with the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, may fulfill Internet of things requirements. However, due to the characteristics of both Internet of things devices and Blockchain technology, integrating Blockchain and the Internet of things can cause several challenges. Despite a large number of papers that have been published in the field of Blockchain and the Internet of things, the problems of this combination remain unclear and scattered. Accordingly, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the challenges related to Blockchain-Internet of things integration by evaluating the related peer-reviewed literature. The paper also discusses some of the recommendations for reducing the effects of these challenges. Moreover, the paper discusses some of the unsolved concerns that must be addressed before the next generation of integrated Blockchain-Internet of things applications can be deployed.

This compute-intensive consensus algorithm is resulting in an ever-increasing electrical cost per transaction, this is compounded by its data storage limitations. Consequently, this phenomenon determines the maximum limit in the transaction processing rate. This limitation is causing many industries to refrain from using Blockchain technology. This paper proposes a Proof-of-Enough-Work (PoEW) consensus algorithm for a BC blockchain configuration to get rid of this obstacle. We present parallel block processing through the reallocation of computing resources, specifically used to add blocks to the blockchain, also called mining. This is explicitly done with an extension to the key BC mining parameters, called the block difficulty or the amount of computing effort needed to process a block. The introduction of an efficient use of computing resources or effort significantly increases the transaction processing rate.Through simulations we demonstrate a significant increase in transaction processing rate compared to conventional PoW. It produces transaction processing comparable to centralised transaction networks or a high transaction throughput solution. Moreover, the proposed consensus algorithm reduces the cost per transaction in terms of electricity usage.","[Newell, Jared; Mamun, Quazi; Rehman, Sabihur; Islam, Md Zahidul] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Comp Math & Engn, Bathurst, NSW, Australia","","Newell, J (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Comp Math & Engn, Bathurst, NSW, Australia.","jared.newell@eclipso.eu; qmamun@csu.edu.au; sarehman@csu.edu.au; zislam@csu.edu.au","","Rehman, Sabih ur/0000-0001-7717-2773; Mamun, Quazi/0000-0003-2196-7651","","","","","14","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1525-3511","","978-1-6654-4266-4","IEEE WCNC","","","2022","","","","","","","1188","1193","","10.1109/WCNC51071.2022.9771549","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WCNC51071.2022.9771549","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BT3GQ","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000819473100201","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Finite polynomial distributed-lags have a long tradition due to a good flexibility accompanied by the advantage of a linear representation, which allows parameter estimation through Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). However, they require to specify polynomial degree and lag length, and entail the loss of some initial observations. Gamma distributed-lags overcome these problems and represents a good compromise between flexibility and number of parameters, however they have not a linear representation in the parameters and currently available estimation methods, like OLS-based grid search and non-linear least squares, are unsatisfactory in the case of multiple explanatory variables. For these reasons, the Gamma lag distribution has not been able to replace finite polynomial lags in applied time series analysis, and it has been mostly employed in the case of a single explanatory variable. In this paper, we propose a hill climbing algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of multiple linear regression with Gamma distributed-lags. The proposed algorithm is applied to assess the dynamic relationship between Bitcoin's price and three composite indices of the US stock market.","[Magrini, Alessandro] Univ Florence, Dept Stat Comp Sci Applicat, Florence, Italy","","Magrini, A (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Stat Comp Sci Applicat G Parenti, Viale Morgagni 59, IT-50134 Florence, Italy.","alessandro.magrini@unifi.it","Magrini, Alessandro/AAT-8562-2021","Magrini, Alessandro/0000-0002-7278-5332","Dipartimenti Eccellenti 2018-2022 ministerial funds, Italy","Dipartimenti Eccellenti 2018-2022 ministerial funds, Italy","We thank reviewers for valuable comments that helped improving the presentation of our work.

This reduces the incentives for the miners' participation and may jeopardize the blockchain security. To mitigate this blockchain insufficient fee issue, we propose a Fee and Waiting Tax (FWT) mechanism, which explicitly considers the two types of negative externalities in the system. Specifically, we model the interactions between the protocol designer, users, and miners as a three-stage Stackelberg game. By characterizing the equilibrium of the game, we find that miners neglecting the negative externality in transaction selection cause they are willing to accept insufficient-fee transactions. This leads to the insufficient storage fee issue in the existing protocol (i.e., deployed in Bitcoin and Ethereum). Moreover, our proposed optimal FWT mechanism can motivate users to pay sufficient transaction fees to cover the storage costs and achieve the unconstrained social optimum. Numerical results show that the optimal FWT mechanism guarantees sufficient transaction fees and achieves an average social welfare improvement of 51.43% or more over the existing protocol. Furthermore, the optimal FWT mechanism reduces the average waiting time of low-fee transactions and all transactions by 68.49% and 61.56%, respectively.","[Liu, Yunshu] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Informat Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yunshu; Cai, Wei; Huang, Jianwei] Shenzhen Inst Artificial Intelligence & Robot Soc, Shenzhen 518129, Peoples R China; [Fang, Zhixuan] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Interdisciplinary Informat Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Fang, Zhixuan] Shanghai Qi Zhi Inst, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Cheung, Man Hon] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Cai, Wei; Huang, Jianwei] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518172, Peoples R China","","Huang, JW (corresponding author), Shenzhen Inst Artificial Intelligence & Robot Soc, Shenzhen 518129, Peoples R China.;Huang, JW (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518172, Peoples R China.","ly018@ie.cuhk.edu.hk; zfang@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn; mhcheung@cityu.edu.hk; caiwei@cuhk.edu.cn; jianweihuang@cuhk.edu.cn","Huang, Jianwei/C-1303-2008","Huang, Jianwei/0000-0001-6631-1096; Liu, Yunshu/0000-0002-1415-3601","Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2021B1515120008]; Shenzhen Science and Technology Program [JCYJ20210324120011032, JCYJ20210324124205016]; Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society; City University of Hong Kong's Start-up Grant [9610493]","Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; Shenzhen Science and Technology Program; Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society; City University of Hong Kong's Start-up Grant","This work was supported in part by the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation under Project 2021B1515120008, in part by the Shenzhen Science and Technology Program under Project JCYJ20210324120011032 and Project JCYJ20210324124205016, in part by the Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society, and in part by the City University of Hong Kong's Start-up Grant under Project 9610493.

The vast majority of miners today participate in mining pools instead of solo mining in order to lower risk and achieve a more steady income. However, this rise of participation in mining pools negatively affects the decentralization levels of most cryptocurrencies. In this work, we look into mining pools from the point of view of a miner: We present an analytical model and implement a computational tool that allows miners to optimally distribute their computational power over multiple pools and PoW cryptocurrencies (i.e. build a mining portfolio), taking into account their risk aversion levels. Our tool allows miners to maximize their risk-adjusted earnings by diversifying across multiple mining pools. Our underlying techniques are drawn from both the areas of financial economy and computer science since we use computer science-based approaches (i.e. optimization techniques) to experimentally prove how parties (and in particular miners) interact with cryptocurrencies in a way of increasing their Sharpe ratio. To showcase our model, we run an experiment in Bitcoin historical data and demonstrate that a miner diversifying over multiple pools, as instructed by our model/tool, receives a higher overall Sharpe ratio (i.e. average excess reward over its standard deviation/volatility).","[Chatzigiannis, Panagiotis; Baldimtsi, Foteini; Griva, Igor; Li, Jiasun] George Mason Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 4400 Univ Dr MSN 4A5, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","","Chatzigiannis, P (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 4400 Univ Dr MSN 4A5, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.","pchatzig@gmu.edu","","","George Mason Multidisciplinary Research (MDR) Initiative; DHS/CINA (Department of Homeland Security/Criminal Investigations andNetwork Analysis) [205187]","George Mason Multidisciplinary Research (MDR) Initiative; DHS/CINA (Department of Homeland Security/Criminal Investigations andNetwork Analysis)","This work was supported by the George Mason Multidisciplinary Research (MDR) Initiative and DHS/CINA (Department of Homeland Security/Criminal Investigations andNetwork Analysis) Award #205187.","","21","0","0","3","3","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","2057-2085","2057-2093","","J CYBERSECURITY","J.

In designing the Lightning Network routing protocol, simulating its transactions, and evaluating the network robustness, researchers have almost always used the Barabasi Albert Model as a substrate network.

In this paper, we construct the temporal network of Lightning Network and compare the topological properties of Lightning Network with those of Barabasi Albert Model of the same scale in detail. Lightning Network has a large gap with Barabasi Albert Model in terms of assortativity and network diameter. We found that nodes tend to connect to nodes with greater Closeness Centrality in terms of node preference connectivity.

Proponents of blockchain-based land systems point toward data security, automated transacting, and improved accessibility as key benefits; critics raise concerns over structural vulnerabilities, such as majority attacks, and inconsistencies with existing legal frameworks. The literature, however, tends to conceptualise blockchain as one monolithic data structure invariably built on the same mechanisms powering Bitcoin. This paper seeks to situate the debate on a closer understanding of the range of blockchain implementations possible. To this end, we provide a detailed technological survey of established and emerging blockchain technologies, clarifying that different consensus mechanisms, permissioning schemes, and other use-based customisations, are possible. We then re-evaluate the promises and perils of blockchain land transfers in this light, focusing on the English conveyancing system, and illustrate how different implementations involve different advantages and limitations. However, the features necessary to avoid key vulnerabilities also diminish the marginal advantages of using blockchains over traditional electronic databases. Thus, we conclude that blockchains, even properly understood, remain unsuitable for land transfers. (C) 2022 Vincent Ooi, Soh Kian Peng, Jerrold Soh. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This article explores the possibilities of using different DLTs to solve traditional distributed computing problems based on their advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we provide an overview and comparison of different DLTs, such as Hashgraph, Tangle, Blockchains, Side Chain and Holochain. The main objective of the article is to examine whether distributed ledger technologies can replace traditional computational methods in other areas instead of traditional methods. Based on the primary keywords, we conducted a systematic review of more than 200 articles. Based on the data extracted from articles related to the use of DLT, we conclude that that DLTs can complement other methods, but cannot completely replace them. Furthermore, several DLTs such as Sidechain, Holochain and Hashgraph are still in their infancy, and we foresee much research work in this area in the coming years.","[Soltani, Reza; Sampalli, Srinivas] Dalhousie Univ, Fac Comp Sci, Halifax, NS B3H 1W5, Canada; [Zaman, Marzia] TeleAI Corp, Ottawa, ON K2E 7V7, Canada; [Joshi, Rohit] Cistel Technol, Ottawa, ON K23 7V7, Canada","","Sampalli, S (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Fac Comp Sci, Halifax, NS B3H 1W5, Canada.","srini@cs.dal.ca","","","Collaborative Research and Development - Natural Sciences Engineering Research Council (NSERC), Canada","Collaborative Research and Development - Natural Sciences Engineering Research Council (NSERC), Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","This research was supported by a Collaborative Research and Development Grant by the Natural Sciences Engineering Research Council (NSERC), Canada.","","117","0","0","5","5","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2076-3417","","APPL SCI-BASEL","Appl.

It is known that stock returns often exhibit volatility clustering and the tails of the distributions of these series are fatter than the normal distribution. As a response to the need of these issues, the high unconditional volatility of assets encourages the users to predict their price in an ever changing market environment. Our main focus in this paper is to study the behavior of returns and volatility dynamics of some general stochastic economic models. First, we apply the local polynomial kernel smoothing method based on nonparametric regression to estimate the mean and the variance of the returns. We then implement and develop an empirical likelihood procedure in terms of conditional variance on daily log returns for inference on the nonparametric stochastic volatility as well as to construct a confidence interval for the volatility function. It appears that the proposed algorithm is applicable to some popular financial models and represents a good fit for the behavior observed in the stock and cryptocurrency markets. Some numerical results in connection to real data on the S & P 500 index and highly volatile Bitcoin dataset are also illustrated. (C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier B.V.

In scholarship, the proposed solution for the consensus protocol is usually inspired by the Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) based on voting rather than the proof-of-work (PoW). The advantage of PoW with respect to BFT is that it allows the final user to evaluate the cost required to change a confirmed transaction without the need to trust the consortium of miners. In this paper, we analyse the problems that arise from the application of PoW in permissioned blockchains. In standard PoW, it may be easy for colluded miners to temporarily reach 50% of the total hash power (HP). Moreover, since mining rewards are not usually expected in permissioned contexts, the problem of balancing the computational efforts among the miners becomes crucial. We propose a solution based on a sliding window algorithm to address these problems and analyse its effectiveness in terms of fairness and security. Furthermore, we present a quantitative, analytical model in order to assess its capacity to balance the hash power provided by heterogeneous miners. Our study considers the trade-off between the need to trust the entire consortium of miners guaranteed by the global HP invested by the mining process and the need to prevent collusion among malicious miners aimed at reaching 50% of the total HP. As a result, the model can be used to find the optimal parameters for the sliding window protocol.","[Malakhov, Ivan; Marin, Andrea; Rossi, Sabina; Smuseva, Daria] Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, DAIS, I-30172 Venice, Italy","","Rossi, S (corresponding author), Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, DAIS, I-30172 Venice, Italy.","sabina.rossi@unive.it","","Rossi, Sabina/0000-0002-1189-4439","INdAM -GNCS 2020 Project Sistemi Reversibili Concorrenti: dai Modelli ai Linguaggi","INdAM -GNCS 2020 Project Sistemi Reversibili Concorrenti: dai Modelli ai Linguaggi","The work of Sabina Rossi was supported in part by the INdAM -GNCS 2020 Project Sistemi Reversibili Concorrenti: dai Modelli ai Linguaggi.''","","24","3","3","6","6","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","1305","1316","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3138528","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3138528","","","12","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","YC9EU","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000739988100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Blockchain technology is becoming recognized as an advanced tool. However, data collaboration using blockchain has not progressed sufficiently among companies in the industrial supply chain (SC) that handle sensitive data, such as those related to product quality, etc. There are two reasons why data utilization is not sufficiently advanced in the industrial SC. The first is that manufacturing information is top secret. Blockchain mechanisms, such as Bitcoin, which uses PKI, require plaintext to be shared between companies to verify the identity of the company that sent the data. Another is that the merits of data collaboration between companies have not been materialized. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a business-to-business collaboration system using homomorphic encryption and blockchain techniques. Using the proposed system, each company can exchange encrypted confidential information and utilize the data for its own business. In a trial, an equipment manufacturer was able to identify the quality change caused by a decrease in equipment performance as a cryptographic value from blockchain and to identify the change one month earlier without knowing the quality value.","[Nasu, Hiroaki] Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Nat Sci & Technol, Okayama 7008530, Japan; [Kodera, Yuta; Nogami, Yasuyuki] Okayama Univ, Fac Nat Sci & Technol, Okayama 7008530, Japan","","Nasu, H (corresponding author), Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Nat Sci & Technol, Okayama 7008530, Japan.","ptk36s3v@s.okayama-u.ac.jp; yuta_kodera@okayama-u.ac.jp; yasuyuki.nogami@okayama-u.ac.jp","","Kodera, Yuta/0000-0002-6482-6122","JSPS KAKENHI [20K20484]","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was funded by the JSPS KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Research (Pioneering) (20K20484).","","43","0","0","4","4","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1424-8220","","SENSORS-BASEL","Sensors","JUL","2022","22","13","","","","","","","4909","10.3390/s22134909","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22134909","","","12","Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation","2X9DO","35808403","Green Published, gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000825497700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Classical statistical and recent deep learning models have been widely used in a variety of forecasting applications. During the training data preparation stage, most models collect samples by sliding a fixed-sized window over the time axis of the input time series. We refer to this conventional method as sparse sampling because it cannot extract sufficient samples because it ignores another important axis representing the window size. In this study, a dense sampling method is proposed that extends the sampling space from one to two dimensions. The new space consists of time and window axes. Dense sampling provides several desirable effects, such as a larger training dataset, an intra-model ensemble, model-agnosticism, and an easier setting of the optimal window. The experiments were conducted using four real datasets: Bitcoin price, influenza-like illness, household electric power consumption, and wind speed. The mean absolute percentage error was measured extensively in terms of varying window sizes, horizons, and lengths of time series. The resulting data showed that dense sampling significantly and consistently outperformed sparse sampling.

Random sampling was used to ensure that the research objectives were adequately examined. A total of 295 respondents answered the survey questions intended for cryptocurrency users in Malaysia. Data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-LSM). The findings revealed that SI, PV, TRA, and AT were all impactful in terms of AD (dependent variable) through the mediation of customer satisfaction in Malaysia's digital market. However, TR negatively impacts Malaysia's digital market. Future researchers in other regions and industries may be able to reproduce these findings and use similar constructs to add to the present body of knowledge.

In order to put the FMH into a broader perspective, the Random Walk and Efficient Market Hypotheses are considered together with the basic principles of fractal geometry. After exploring the historical developments associated with different financial hypotheses, an overview of the basic mathematical modelling is provided. The principal goal of this paper is to consider the intrinsic scaling properties that are characteristic for each hypothesis. In regard to the FMH, it is explained why a financial time series can be taken to be characterised by a 1/t(1-1/gamma) scaling law, where gamma > 0 is the Levy index, which is able to quantify the likelihood of extreme changes in price differences occurring (or otherwise). In this context, the paper explores how the Levy index, coupled with other metrics, such as the Lyapunov Exponent and the Volatility, can be combined to provide long-term forecasts. Using these forecasts as a quantification for risk assessment, short-term price predictions are considered using a machine learning approach to evolve a nonlinear formula that simulates price values. A short case study is presented which reports on the use of this approach to forecast Bitcoin exchange rate values.","[Blackledge, Jonathan] Sci Fdn Ireland, Thre Pk Pl,Hatch St Upper, Dublin D02 FX65, Ireland; [Blackledge, Jonathan] Warsaw Univ Technol, Ctr Adv Studies, Plac Politech 1, PL-00661 Warsaw, Poland; [Blackledge, Jonathan] Univ Western Cape, Dept Comp Sci, Robert Sobukwe Rd, ZA-7535 Cape Town, South Africa; [Blackledge, Jonathan] Wrexham Glyndwr Univ Wales, Fac Arts Sci & Technol, Mold Rd, Wrexham LL11 2AW, Wales; [Blackledge, Jonathan] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Math Stat & Comp Sci, Univ Rd, ZA-3629 Durban, South Africa; [Blackledge, Jonathan] Smart Data & Assets Ltd, 86-90 Paul St, London EC2A 4NE, England; [Blackledge, Jonathan; Lamphiere, Marc] Technol Univ Dublin, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Cent Quad, Grangegorman Campus, Dublin D07 EWV4, Ireland; [Blackledge, Jonathan; Lamphiere, Marc] Technol Univ Dublin, Dublin Energy Lab, Dublin D07 ADY7, Ireland; [Lamphiere, Marc] The Masonry, Mace Grp, 151 Thomas St, Dublin D07 ADY7, Ireland","","Blackledge, J (corresponding author), Sci Fdn Ireland, Thre Pk Pl,Hatch St Upper, Dublin D02 FX65, Ireland.;Blackledge, J (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Technol, Ctr Adv Studies, Plac Politech 1, PL-00661 Warsaw, Poland.;Blackledge, J (corresponding author), Univ Western Cape, Dept Comp Sci, Robert Sobukwe Rd, ZA-7535 Cape Town, South Africa.;Blackledge, J (corresponding author), Wrexham Glyndwr Univ Wales, Fac Arts Sci & Technol, Mold Rd, Wrexham LL11 2AW, Wales.;Blackledge, J (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Math Stat & Comp Sci, Univ Rd, ZA-3629 Durban, South Africa.;Blackledge, J (corresponding author), Smart Data & Assets Ltd, 86-90 Paul St, London EC2A 4NE, England.;Blackledge, J (corresponding author), Technol Univ Dublin, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Cent Quad, Grangegorman Campus, Dublin D07 EWV4, Ireland.;Blackledge, J (corresponding author), Technol Univ Dublin, Dublin Energy Lab, Dublin D07 ADY7, Ireland.","jonathan.blackledge@tudublin.ie; marc.lamphiere@macegroup.com","","","Science Foundation Ireland","Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation IrelandEuropean Commission)","FundingThe research reported in this article was partly funded by the Science Foundation Ireland.","","143","1","1","9","15","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-7390","","MATHEMATICS-BASEL","Mathematics","JAN","2022","10","1","","","","","","","117","10.3390/math10010117","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math10010117","","","46","Mathematics","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Mathematics","YF3LE","","gold, Green Published","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000741711700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Available systems typically use public blockchain networks such as Ethereum and Bitcoin to store learning results. However, the cost of writing data on these networks is significant, making educational institutions limit data sent to the target network, typically containing only hash codes of the issued certificates. In this paper, we present a system based on a private blockchain network for lifelong learning data authentication and management named B4E (Blockchain For Education). B4E stores not only certificates but also learners' training data such as transcripts and educational programs in order to create a complete record of the lifelong education of each user and verify certificates that they have obtained. As a result, B4E can address two types of fake certificates, i.e., certificates printed by unlawful organizations and certificates issued by educational institutions for learners who have not met the training requirements. In addition, B4E is designed to allow all participants to easily deploy software packages to manage, share, and check stored information without depending on a single point of access. As such, the system enhances the transparency and reliability of the stored data. Our experiments show that B4E meets expectations for deployment in reality.","[Ba-Lam Do; Van-Thanh Nguyen; Hoang-Nam Dinh; Thanh-Chung Dao; BinhMinh Nguyen] Hanoi Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Informat & Commun Technol, Hanoi, Vietnam","","Do, BL (corresponding author), Hanoi Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Informat & Commun Technol, Hanoi, Vietnam.","lamdb@soict.hust.edu.vn","","","Vietnamese MOET's project Researching and applying blockchain technology [B2020-BKA-14]","Vietnamese MOET's project Researching and applying blockchain technology","This research was supported by the Vietnamese MOET's project Researching and applying blockchain technology to the problem of authenticating the certificate issuing process in Vietnam, No. B2020-BKA-14.","","26","0","0","16","16","TECH SCIENCE PRESS","HENDERSON","871 CORONADO CENTER DR, SUTE 200, HENDERSON, NV 89052 USA","0267-6192","","","COMPUT SYST SCI ENG","Comput.

Its security can help to improve the confidentiality of patient data and can also help secure the supply chain of medicines. The security and transparency of the blockchain will play a crucial role in the medical industry. This will allow companies to register their products and conduct secure transactions. QR codes can also be placed on the back of medicine containers to help customers identify the authenticity of the products they purchase. The exchange of health information through the blockchain will also have various challenges, such as maintaining the confidentiality of patient data. At the same time, due to the different regulations in different countries, it can be difficult to establish an efficient and secure exchange. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, blockchains are usually immutable, which means that the data added in the chain will always remain.

As the oil market has been historically known to associate with other financial and commodity markets, it is important to see if oil connects differently with prominent financial assets during market turbulence caused by a war. Thus, we make the first attempt to examine how oil connects with prominent financial assets, namely bonds, bitcoin, U.S. dollar, gold, and stocks, using intra-day data, before and during the war. We find that connectedness is stronger during the war than before it. Oil becomes a net transmitter of spillovers during the war, unlike in the pre-war era when it is characterized as a net receiver of spillovers. Also, whereas the net directional pairwise results suggest heterogeneity regarding how oil connects individually with each of the remaining assets before the war, oil has a strong spillover effect on all of them during the war. However, the spillover effect is transitory, as it dies out over time. The findings are robust to intra-day data of different frequency, and have suitable implications for short-term investors, and further agendas for future research in relation to the impacts of the war are provided.","[Adekoya, Oluwasegun B.; Oliyide, Johnson A.] Fed Univ Agr, Dept Econ, Abeokuta, Nigeria; [Yaya, OlaOluwa S.] Univ Ibadan, Fac Sci, Dept Stat, Financial & Econ Stat Unit, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Al-Faryan, Mamdouh Abdulaziz Saleh] Univ Portsmouth, Fac Business & Law, Dept Accounting & Financial Management, Portsmouth, England; Ctr Econometr & Appl Res, Ibadan, Nigeria","","Adekoya, OB (corresponding author), Fed Univ Agr, Dept Econ, Abeokuta, Nigeria.","adekoyaob@gmail.com; oliyide.ayobamij@gmail.com; os.yaya@ui.edu.ng; Al-Faryan@hotmail.com","Al-Faryan, Mamdouh Abdulaziz Saleh/AAZ-6694-2021; Adekoya, Oluwasegun/ABA-2556-2020; YAYA, OLAOLUWA S./N-1615-2019","Al-Faryan, Mamdouh Abdulaziz Saleh/0000-0003-1665-807X; Adekoya, Oluwasegun/0000-0001-7238-6932; YAYA, OLAOLUWA S./0000-0002-7554-3507","","","","","21","6","6","16","16","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0301-4207","1873-7641","","RESOUR POLICY","Resour.

The trustworthiness and integrity of web archives is still an open challenge, especially in the news portal domain, which face additional challenges of censorship even in democratic societies. The aim of this paper is to present a light-weight, blockchain-based solution for web archive validation, which would ensure that documents retrieved by crawlers are authentic for many years to come. We developed our archive validation solution as an extension and continuation of our work in web crawler development mainly targeting news portals. The system is designed as an overlay over a blockchain with a proof-of-stake (PoS) distributed consensus algorithm. PoS was chosen due to its lower ecological footprint compared to proof-of-work solutions (e.g. Bitcoin) and lower expected investment in computing infrastructure. We based our prototype on the open-source Nxt blockchain and implemented it in Python. The prototype was tested on web archive content crawled from Hungarian news portals at two different timestamps with more than 1 million articles in total. We concluded that the proposed solution is accessible, usable by different stakeholders to validate crawled content, deployable on cheap commodity hardware, tackles the archive integrity challenge and is capable to efficiently manage duplicate documents.","[Lendak, Imre] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Informat, Data Sci & Engn Dept, Budapest, Hungary; [Indig, Balazs; Palko, Gabor] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Humanities, Dept Digital Humanities, Budapest, Hungary; [Lendak, Imre] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Novi Sad, Serbia","","Lendak, I (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Informat, Data Sci & Engn Dept, Budapest, Hungary.;Lendak, I (corresponding author), Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Novi Sad, Serbia.","lendak@inf.elte.hu; indig.balazs@btk.elte.hu; palko.gabor@btk.elte.hu","","","Institutional Excellence Program for Higher Education (FIKP) of the Republic of Hungary","Institutional Excellence Program for Higher Education (FIKP) of the Republic of Hungary","This research was supported by the Institutional Excellence Program for Higher Education (FIKP) of the Republic of Hungary.","","42","1","1","0","0","IOS PRESS","AMSTERDAM","NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0926-227X","1875-8924","","J COMPUT SECUR","J.

Recently, two interview-based studies have suggested that DWMs may also promote the emergence of direct user-to-user (U2U) trading relationships. Here, we carefully investigate and quantify the scale of U2U trading around DWMs by analysing 31 million Bitcoin transactions among users of 40 DWMs between June 2011 and Jan 2021. We find that half of the DWM users trade through U2U pairs generating a total trading volume greater than DWMs themselves. We then show that hundreds of thousands of DWM users form stable trading pairs that are persistent over time. Users in such stable pairs turn out to be the ones with the largest trading volume on DWMs. Then, we show that new U2U pairs often form while both users are active on the same DWM, suggesting the marketplace may serve as a catalyst for new direct trading relationships. Finally, we reveal that stable U2U pairs tend to survive DWM closures and that they were not affected by COVID-19, indicating that their trading activity is resilient to external shocks. Our work unveils sophisticated patterns of trade emerging in the dark web and highlights the importance of investigating user behaviour beyond the immediate buyer-seller network on a single marketplace.","[Nadini, Matthieu; Bracci, Alberto; Baronchelli, Andrea] City Univ London, Dept Math, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Nadini, Matthieu; Baronchelli, Andrea] British Lib, Alan Turing Inst, 96 Euston Rd, London NW1 2DB, England; [ElBahrawy, Abeer; Gradwell, Philip] Chainalysis Inc, New York, NY USA; [Teytelboym, Alexander] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Teytelboym, Alexander] Univ Oxford, INET Oxford, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Baronchelli, Andrea] UCL, UCL Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England","","Baronchelli, A (corresponding author), City Univ London, Dept Math, London EC1V 0HB, England.;Baronchelli, A (corresponding author), British Lib, Alan Turing Inst, 96 Euston Rd, London NW1 2DB, England.;Baronchelli, A (corresponding author), UCL, UCL Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England.","abaronchelli@turing.ac.uk","","Nadini, Matthieu/0000-0003-4542-7481","ESRC, UK Research and Innovation's rapid response to COVID-19 [ES/V00400X/1]; Alan Turing Institute; UK National Institute for Data Science and AI","ESRC, UK Research and Innovation's rapid response to COVID-19; Alan Turing Institute; UK National Institute for Data Science and AI","M.N., A.Br., A.T., and A.Ba. were supported by ESRC as part of UK Research and Innovation's rapid response to COVID-19, through grant ES/V00400X/1.

In the complex architecture of a DLT system, a consensus protocol plays a key role by ensuring that all participants agree on the data integrity without any central authority. A wide range of consensus protocols have been designed with different concepts and properties (e.g., lower energy consumption, better scalability, smaller latency, higher throughput, etc.). The key requirements for consensus protocols passing from one blockchain system to another often differ significantly, and there is no one-fit-all protocol. Therefore, selecting the most suitable consensus protocol for a particular DLT system is essential, but at the same time a challenging step, as decision-makers need to make a trade-off between conflicting requirements. This paper introduces a framework for selecting the most suitable consensus protocols depending on the identified criteria, priorities, and other requirements by incorporating Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques. We demonstrate its potential by identifying the preferable consensuses for the three most common types of existing blockchain systems and on an actual application for bike renting.

This growth brings up several challenging issues for a successful continuous operation of IoT applications. Some of these challenges that need to be taken care of are resource constraints, central server overload, and the risk of illegal use of private data. On the other side, Blockchain technology is increasingly popular and has gained huge success in cryptocurrencies. It offers numerous vital qualities such as a technique for consensus, peer communications, confidence-building without a trustworthy third party, and a transaction controlled by conditions and functions using the intelligent contract technique. Blockchain is an excellent candidate to establish a decentralized, autonomous IoT system addressing the above issues. This study proposes an IoT-Blockchain integration architecture using an Ethereum Blockchain infrastructure within a rich-thin client IoT approach to address the challenges created by the limited IoT resources while implementing the Blockchain mining technique in IoT systems. The architecture depends on load distribution between the resources. Limited resource devices are the thin-clients, while the higher resource devices are assigned as rich-clients. Both clients can access the blockchain and collect the data, but rich-client can only execute the mining process.

Successful cyber attacks on nation-states have proved that cyber threats can jeopardize significant national interests. In response, nation-states have begun to handle cyber threats at the national defense level, which is titled 'cyber defense.' The cyber defense sector is related to national security, therefore requires robust security technology. Contrary to normal systems, blockchain provides strong security properties without a centralized control entity, and as such its application in the cyber defense field is under the spotlight. In this paper, we present opportunities blockchain provides for cyber defense, research and national projects, and limitations. We constructed a survey of government documents, interviews, related news, technical reports, and research papers from 2016 to 2021. As a result, our research contributes to reducing the gap in blockchain for cyber defense by systematically conducting research and analysis. In our research, we found that not only research but also government-led plans are actively promoting blockchain, which demonstrates that blockchain will play a remarkable role in cyber defense.

Therefore, accurate cryptocurrency price forecasting is essential for market participants and regulators. It has been demonstrated that improved data forecasting accuracy can be achieved through decomposition, but few researchers have performed information extraction on the residual series generated by data decomposition. Based on the construction of a decomposition-optimization-integration hybrid model framework, in this paper, we propose a multi-scale hybrid forecasting model that combines the residual components after primary decomposition for secondary decomposition and integration. This model uses the variational modal decomposition (VMD) method to decompose the original return series into a finite number of components and residual terms. Then, the residual terms are decomposed, and the features are extracted using the completed ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) method. The components are predicted by an extreme learning machine optimized by the sparrow search algorithm, and the final predictions are summed to obtain the final results. Forecasts for the returns of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are significant cryptocurrency assets, are compared with other benchmark models constructed based on different ideas. We find that the proposed quadratic decomposition VMD-Res.-CEEMDAN-SSA-ELM hybrid model demonstrates the optimal and most stable forecasting performance in both one-step and multi-step ahead prediction of the cryptocurrency return series.","[Du, Xiaoxu; Chen, Kaijie; Cai, Yi] Fuzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Fuzhou 350108, Peoples R China; [Tang, Zhenpeng] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Fuzhou 350002, Peoples R China; [Wu, Junchuan] Nanchang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanchang 330031, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","","Tang, ZP (corresponding author), Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Fuzhou 350002, Peoples R China.","zhenpt@fzu.edu.cn","","Tang, Zhenpeng/0000-0002-8376-2128; Du, Xiaoxu/0000-0001-9915-5923","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71973028, 71573042]","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant 71973028 and Grant 71573042.","","54","0","0","7","7","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","60397","60411","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3179364","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3179364","","","15","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","2D4TT","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000811542300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Against this backdrop, the current study measures the asymmetric relationship between green bonds, U.S. economic policy uncertainty (EPU), and bitcoins by employing the Nonlinear Autoregressive Distribution Lag (NARDL) estimation technique recently developed by Shin et al. The outcome of the empirical analysis confirms an asymmetric cointegration between EPU, bitcoins, the clean energy index, oil prices, and green bonds. The NARDL estimation substantiates that positive shock in EPU exerts a negative impact on green bonds, whereas a negative shock in EPU increases the performance of green bonds. It implies, in the long run, a 1 percent increase (decrease) in EPU decreases (increases) the performance of green bonds by 0.22 percent and 0.11 percent, respectively. Likewise, the study also confirms a bidirectional relationship between bitcoins and green bonds. A positive shock in bitcoin increases the performance of green bonds and vice versa. In addition, our study also reveals a direct co-movement between clean energy, oil prices, and green bonds. This outcome implies that green bonds are not a different asset class, and they mirror the performance of other asset classes, such as clean energy, oil prices, and bitcoins. The findings offer several implications to understand the hedging and diversification properties of bitcoins, and assist in understanding the role of U.S. economic policy uncertainty on green bonds.","[Syed, Aamir Aijaz] Shri Ramswaroop Mem Univ, Inst Management Commerce & Econ, Lucknow 226016, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Ahmed, Farhan] NED Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Econ & Management Sci, Karachi 75270, Pakistan; [Kamal, Muhammad Abdul] Abdul Wali Khan Univ, Dept Econ, Mardan 23200, Pakistan; [Ullah, Assad] Henan Univ, Dept Econ, Kaifeng 475001, Peoples R China; [Ramos-Requena, Jose Pedro] Univ Almeria, Dept Econ & Business, Almeria 04120, Spain","","Ramos-Requena, JP (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Dept Econ & Business, Almeria 04120, Spain.","aamirank@gmail.com; fahmed@neduet.edu.pk; kamal@awkum.edu.pk; assad@henu.edu.cn; jpramosre@ual.es","Ahmed, Farhan/W-8201-2019; Ullah, Assad/AAK-8535-2020; Syed, Aamir Aijaz/AAF-3055-2020; Kamal, Muhammad Abdul/AAE-9420-2019","Ahmed, Farhan/0000-0002-1147-8347; Ullah, Assad/0000-0001-5365-0224; Syed, Aamir Aijaz/0000-0002-5510-7644; Kamal, Muhammad Abdul/0000-0003-3419-7879; Ramos Requena, Jose Pedro/0000-0002-6600-8529","","","","","47","5","5","16","18","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-7390","","MATHEMATICS-BASEL","Mathematics","MAR","2022","10","5","","","","","","","720","10.3390/math10050720","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math10050720","","","15","Mathematics","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Mathematics","ZR9MY","","gold, Green Published","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000768100800001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Therefore, many users are willing to conduct transactions in blockchain cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the throughput of traditional blockchain is extremely low, and the transaction is so delayed. The payment channel network is the most promising solution to expand the blockchain for widespread use. Achieving secure instant payment on the payment channel can significantly increase transaction throughput and reduce transaction delays. When the payment channel is closed, the balance in the channel will be returned to an account on the blockchain. In this paper, we discuss the design and the implementation of a multiparty payment channel network based on smart contracts. Where a two-party payment channel is designed based on blockchain and smart contracts, a new multiparty payment channel is established on the basis of the payment channel. A detailed definition and description are given, and the creation, update, and closing functions of the multiparty payment channel are designed. Moreover, we design a multiparty payment channel smart contract, deploy it to the local private blockchain, and conduct simulation and testing. The delay time of different transaction methods is counted, and the network topology type, transaction amount, and other factors are studied. The impact of transaction success rate and the gas consumption of different transaction methods are analyzed through multiple sets of experimental statistics.","[Zhang, Yanjun] Party Sch Changzhi Comm Communist Party China, Changzhi, Shanxi, Peoples R China","","Zhang, YJ (corresponding author), Party Sch Changzhi Comm Communist Party China, Changzhi, Shanxi, Peoples R China.","yanjunzhang@hainanu.edu.cn","","","","","","","24","0","0","10","10","HINDAWI LTD","LONDON","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","2314-4629","2314-4785","","J MATH-UK","J.

This has resulted in several academic and industrial initiatives to address privacy. Starting with the UTXO model of Bitcoin, initial works brought confidentiality and anonymity to payments. Recent works have expanded to support more generalized forms of private computation. Such solutions tend to be highly involved as they rely on advanced cryptographic primitives and creative techniques to handle issues related to dealing with private records (e.g. concurrency and double spending). This situation makes it hard to comprehend the current state-of-the-art, much less build on top of it. To address these challenges, we develop a systematization of knowledge for privacy-preserving solutions in blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first of its kind. After motivating design challenges, we devise two systematization frameworks-the first as a stepping stone to the second-and use them to study the state-of-the-art. For our first framework, we study the zero-knowledge proof systems used in surveyed solutions, based on their key features and limitations. Our second is for privacy-preserving solutions; we define several dimensions to categorize the surveyed schemes and, in doing so, identify two major paradigms employed to achieve private computation. We go on to provide insights to guide solutions' adoption and development. Finally, we touch upon challenges related to limited functionality and accommodating new developments.","[Almashaqbeh, Ghada] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Solomon, Ravital] Sunscreen, San Francisco, CA USA","","Almashaqbeh, G (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.","ghada@uconn.edu; ravital@sunscreen.tech","","","","","","","82","0","0","0","0","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-6654-1614-6","","","","2022","","","","","","","124","139","","10.1109/EuroSP53844.2022.00016","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EuroSP53844.2022.00016","","","16","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7ZF","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000851574500008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In such permissioned blockchain, the transaction (TX) assignment strategy could be malicious such that the network shards may possibly receive imbalanced transactions or even bursty-TX injection attacks. An imbalanced transaction assignment brings serious threats to the stability of the sharded blockchain. A stable sharded blockchain can ensure that each shard processes the arrived transactions timely. Since the system stability is closely related to the blockchain throughput, how to maintain a stable sharded blockchain becomes a challenge. To depict the transaction processing in each network shard, we adopt the Lyapunov Optimization framework. Exploiting drift-plus-penalty (DPP) technique, we then propose an adaptive resource-allocation algorithm, which can yield the near-optimal solution for each network shard while the shard queues can also be stably maintained. We also rigorously analyze the theoretical boundaries of both the system objective and the queue length of shards. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a better balance between resource consumption and queue stability than other baselines. We particularly evaluate two representative cases of bursty-TX injection attacks, i.e., the continued attacks against all network shards and the drastic attacks against a single network shard. The evaluation results show that the DPP-based algorithm can well alleviate the imbalanced TX assignment, and simultaneously maintain high throughput while consuming fewer resources than other baselines.","[Huang, Huawei; Yue, Zhengyu; Peng, Xiaowen; He, Liuding; Chen, Wuhui; Zheng, Zibin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Dai, Hong-Ning] Lingnan Univ, Dept Comp & Decis Sci, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Guo, Song] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China","","Huang, HW (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.","huanghw28@mail.sysu.edu.cn; yuezhy6@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; pengxw3@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; held3@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; chenwuh@mail.sysu.edu.cn; hndai@ieee.org; zhzibin@mail.sysu.edu.cn; song.guo@polyu.edu.hk","Guo, Song/AAZ-4542-2020; Zheng, Zibin/E-3024-2014; Dai, Hong-Ning/B-1931-2012","Guo, Song/0000-0001-9831-2202; Zheng, Zibin/0000-0002-7878-4330; Dai, Hong-Ning/0000-0001-6165-4196","National Key R&D Program of China [2020YFB1006005]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61872310]; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2019A1515011798]; Guangzhou Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [202102020613]; Pearl River Talent Recruitment Program [2019QN01X130]; CCF-Huawei Populus euphratica forest fund [CCF-HuaweiBC2021004]; Hong Kong RGC Research Impact Fund (RIF) [R5060-19]; General Research Fund (GRF) [152221/19E, 152203/20E, 152244/21E]; Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission [R2020A045]","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; Guangzhou Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; Pearl River Talent Recruitment Program; CCF-Huawei Populus euphratica forest fund; Hong Kong RGC Research Impact Fund (RIF); General Research Fund (GRF); Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission","This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2020YFB1006005, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61902445, in part by Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation under Grant 2019A1515011798, in part by Guangzhou Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation under Grant 202102020613, in part by Pearl River Talent Recruitment Program under Grant 2019QN01X130, in part by CCF-Huawei Populus euphratica forest fund under Grant CCF-HuaweiBC2021004, Hong Kong RGC Research Impact Fund (RIF) with the Project No. R5060-19, General Research Fund (GRF) with the Project No. 152221/19E, 152203/20E, and 152244/21E, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61872310, and in part by Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission under Grant R2020A045.","","31","2","2","20","20","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA","1045-9219","1558-2183","","IEEE T PARALL DISTR","IEEE Trans.

Although distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) could provide such a platform, blockchains, such as Bitcoin, were not designed with IoT networks in mind, hence are often unsuitable for such applications: they offer poor transaction throughput and confirmation times, put stress on constrained computing and storage resources, and require high transaction fees. In this article, we consider a class of IoT-friendly DLTs based on directed acyclic graphs, rather than a blockchain, and with a reputation system in the place of Proof of Work (PoW). However, without PoW, the implementation of these DLTs requires an access control algorithm to manage the rate at which nodes can add new transactions to the ledger. We model the access control problem and present an algorithm that is fair, efficient, and secure. Our algorithm represents a new design paradigm for DLTs in which concepts from networking are applied to the DLT setting for the first time. For example, our algorithm uses distributed rate setting, which is similar in nature to transmission control used in the Internet. However, our solution features novel adaptations to cope with the adversarial environment of DLTs in which no individual agent can be trusted. Our algorithm guarantees utilization of resources, consistency, fairness, and resilience against attackers. All of these are achieved efficiently and with regard for the limitations of IoT devices. We perform extensive simulations to validate these claims.","[Cullen, Andrew; Ferraro, Pietro; Shorten, Robert] Imperial Coll London, Dyson Sch Design Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Sanders, William; Vigneri, Luigi] IOTA Fdn, Res Dept, D-10405 Berlin, Germany; [Shorten, Robert] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Dublin D04 V1W8, Ireland","","Cullen, A (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dyson Sch Design Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England.","a.cullen19@imperial.ac.uk; luigi.vigneri@iota.org","","Shorten, Robert/0000-0002-9239-2499; Cullen, Andrew/0000-0001-6978-6433","Science Foundation Ireland [16/IA/4610]; IOTA Foundation","Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation IrelandEuropean Commission); IOTA Foundation","This work was supported in part by the Science Foundation Ireland under Grant 16/IA/4610, and in part by the IOTA Foundation.","","39","1","1","1","1","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2327-4662","","","IEEE INTERNET THINGS","IEEE Internet Things J.","FEB 1","2022","9","3","","","","","2277","2292","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3096129","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2021.3096129","","","16","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","YN7VN","","Green Submitted","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000747462100054","View Full Record in Web of Science"

On the other hand, innovative solutions for smart cities are concerned with how services and information can be safely stored and shared. For this reason, smart city systems can benefit from using Blockchain to integrate their data and services. These smart solutions also demand consistency and standardization across the industry. However, this Blockchain integration varies according to its implementation. FIWARE, a framework of an open-source platform for smart solutions, adopts NGSI Standards (Context Information Management (CIM); NGSI-LD API: Tech. Rep., CIM and ETSI Industry Specification Group (ISG), 2020) to enable the integration of components and provides the basis for interoperability and portability among smart solutions. Unfortunately, FIWARE does not support any integration with Blockchain technology. Hence, this paper proposes a set of new components to allow FIWARE to be integrated with Blockchain technology. With these proposed components, it is possible to support Blockchain technology with smart city applications via the FIWARE platform. For instance, we have designed and implemented a FIWARE Blockchain adapter to submit/listen to transactions from/to FIWARE Context Broker to/from any Blockchain implementation without human intervention. In addition, we present a global post-pandemic vaccination case study to evaluate the proposed approach in the Smart City context.","[Loss, Stefano; Cacho, Nelio] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Informat & Appl Math, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Singh, Har Preet] FIWARE Fdn, Berlin, Germany; [Lopes, Frederico] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Metropole Digital Inst, Natal, RN, Brazil","","Loss, S (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Informat & Appl Math, Natal, RN, Brazil.","momoloss10@gmail.com; harpreet.singh@fiware.org; neliocacho@dimap.ufrn.br; fred@imd.ufrn.br","Loss, Stefano/GMM-6018-2022","Loss, Stefano/0000-0003-0093-4930","Smart Metropolis Project","Smart Metropolis Project","This work was supported by the Smart Metropolis Project http://smartmetropolis.imd.ufrn.br.","","27","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1386-7857","1573-7543","","CLUSTER COMPUT","Cluster Comput.","","","","","","","","","","","","10.1007/s10586-022-03732-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10586-022-03732-x","","SEP 2022","14","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science","4L2MN","36091661","Bronze, Green Published","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000852467500001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Blockchain, as the underlying technology of Bitcoin's digital monetary system, is currently sweeping the globe. Blockchain is a revolutionary decentralized database technology that employs encryption, a timestamp chain data structure, a distributed consensus mechanism, and other technologies to achieve decentralization, tamper resistance, easy tracking, and programmable smart contracts. In the face of rising financial technology, we must maintain inclusive, technological, and invasive regulatory principles that not only foster financial innovation, but also conduct dynamic supervision to avoid systemic financial hazards. The consensus algorithm is one of the main blockchain technologies that has a direct impact on the system's functioning. As a result, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based development and supervision method for financial technology, as well as an application of this technology to commercial settlement, which can significantly reduce data complexity, time consumption, and the structural chain phenomenon in existing transaction settlement. We bring the idea of pow competition into DPoS, construct a consensus algorithm with an upgrade mechanism, and call it delegated proof of work, based on an in-depth investigation of the working principle of pow (proof of work) (dDPoS). The blocking efficiency of the dDPoS consensus method is around one block every 10 seconds, which is significantly higher than the blocking efficiency of the POW and POS consensus algorithms. As a result, it offers a potential answer to traditional centralized institutions' concerns of high brokerage costs and insecure central storage, as well as a wide range of application possibilities.","[Yang, Rui] Chongqing Ind Polytech Coll, Coll Econ & Management, Chongqing 401120, Peoples R China","","Yang, R (corresponding author), Chongqing Ind Polytech Coll, Coll Econ & Management, Chongqing 401120, Peoples R China.","yangrui@cqipc.edu.cn","","","","","","","30","0","0","3","3","HINDAWI LTD","LONDON","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","1687-5265","1687-5273","","COMPUT INTEL NEUROSC","Comput.

Utopia of Abstraction offers an analysis of the utopian promise of digital organizations through a reading of one such project, Colony. We provide a critique of the ideology of Colony's white paper, supplemented by readings of pages from its website, as a member of a genre of texts that promote their products through seemingly neutral, technical descriptions. Colony's texts suggest an abstract, contextless and scaleless organizational solution-powered by smart contracts on a blockchain-that, according to its proponents, might be applied to any social situation, from small firm to state-level governance. For its users, this organization combines a promise of sovereignty removed from that of the state, as well as implied financial returns. Our reading of Colony echoes the critiques of scholars arguing that cyberlibertarianism is a dominant politic of blockchain technologies. Furthermore, drawing on critiques of code as law and the elision of the social in smart contracts, we argue that Colony's vision presents a model of technical organization that substitutes for the state in the context of waning popular sovereignty. We ultimately suggest an understanding of digital organizations reminiscent of the settler colonial situation: the assumption of an empty social space to be filled, and the promise of sovereignty and riches for those occupying it. Analysis of these logics is relevant as hype increases around non-fungible tokens, Web3, and the corporate metaverse as well as data practices more widely.","[Corballis, Tim; Soar, Max] Victoria Univ Wellington, Ctr Sci Soc, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand","","Corballis, T (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Ctr Sci Soc, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.","tim.corballis@vuw.ac.nz","","Soar, Max/0000-0001-7509-7861","","","","","55","0","0","58","58","SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","THOUSAND OAKS","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","2053-9517","","","BIG DATA SOC","Big Data Soc.","JAN","2022","9","1","","","","","","","2.0539517221085E+16","10.1177/20539517221084587","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/20539517221084587","","","12","Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Social Sciences - Other Topics","0C1AW","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000775055000001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In a nutshell, after performing an initial setup in which the hot wallet receives partial information of the cold wallet in order to hierarchically generate (transaction receiving) addresses, the cold wallet stays offline, whereas the hot wallet is kept online. The initial transferred information enables the hot wallet to generate receiving addresses for both wallets, but it can only spend its own funds, i.e., it cannot spend the funds in the cold wallet. This design conveniently mimics money storage in daily life: pocket money is kept in a less safe location, e.g., a regular wallet, while life savings are kept in a more safe environment, e.g., banking account. Note that the funds that land in offline addresses cannot be spent if the cold wallet is kept permanently offline. We propose a protocol and a technical solution to spend funds from a cold wallet without physically connecting it to any network. We designed and implemented a prototype for a system based on Optical Camera Communication (OCC) in a screen to camera setting, which can receive messages from a computer screen at the rate of over 150kB per second. Our system consists of a sequence of QR codes - a QR video. Our solution minimizes the possible attack vectors, including malware, by relying on optical communication yet providing a larger bandwidth than regular QR code based solutions.","[Dowsley, Rafael; Farias, Mylene C.

Blockchain allows digital transactions between two parties without a third party as a broker. Blockchain is now applicable beyond fintech to various other industries. Among these, Hyperledger fabric has emerged as the most popular blockchain-based open-source permissioned platform targeting business applications. It has been used in over 400 proofs-of-concept blockchain and is well proven in applications, such as supply chain, healthcare, and so on. Despite the many obvious benefits observed in blockchain-enhanced platforms, there still exist technical challenges in scalability, causing performance deficiency, which includes latency and throughput. There is an exigent need to improve the current blockchain-based applications to have the blockchain nodes be scalable without compromising the blockchain performance. In this study, we present the impact of workload variance of up to 1000 transactions with the setup of 20 blockchain nodes in the Hyperledger LTS platform. The evaluation metrics are transaction success and failure rate, throughput, and latency in the blockchain. The transaction throughput was found to be consistent with the increasing workload on a constant number of nodes. However, it showed a declining trend with an increasing number of nodes. As far as the latency, it was in tandem with the increased workload and the number of nodes. We, therefore, conclude that the LTS version is suitable for small and medium enterprises that do not scale up.","[Khan, Dodo; Jung, Low Tang; Hashmani, Manzoor Ahmed; Cheong, Moke Kwai] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Jung, Low Tang; Hashmani, Manzoor Ahmed] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, High Performance Cloud Comp Ctr HPC3, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia","","Khan, D (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia.","dodo_18001633@utp.edu.my; lowtanjung@utp.edu.my; manzoor.hashmani@utp.edu.my; kwai_17002385@utp.edu.my","Khan, Dodo/GNW-6114-2022","Khan, Dodo/0000-0003-0569-6070; Hashmani, Manzoor/0000-0002-6617-8149; Khan, Dodo/0000-0003-4149-1419; Low, Tang Jung/0000-0002-2059-5107","Malaysia Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) [FRGS/1/2019/ICT01/UTP/02/1, 17508, FRGS 2019-1]","Malaysia Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE)","The study was conducted in Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP) under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) funded by the Malaysia Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) with the reference code of FRGS/1/2019/ICT01/UTP/02/1, the project ID of 17508, the selected grant number of FRGS 2019-1, and the general project title of Generic Consensus Model for Improving Nodes Syndicating Performance in Blockchain.","","37","2","2","11","13","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1424-8220","","SENSORS-BASEL","Sensors","FEB","2022","22","3","","","","","","","915","10.3390/s22030915","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22030915","","","17","Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation","ZG4NO","35161661","gold, Green Published","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000760236500001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

While first interesting networks are emerging, we currently have relatively limited insights into the structure and distribution of these networks. Such knowledge, however, is useful, when reasoning about possible performance improvements or the security of the network. For example, information about the different node types and implementations in the network can help when planning the distribution of critical software updates. This paper reports on a large measurement study of Lightning, a leading off-chain network, considering recorded network messages over a period of more than two years. In particular, we present an approach to classify the node types (LND, C-Lightning and Eclair) in the network, and find that we can determine the implementation of 99.9% of nodes correctly in our data set. We then report on geographical aspects of the Lightning Network, showing that proximity is less relevant, and that the Lightning Network is particularly predominant in metropolitan areas. Furthermore, we address various aspects of channels in the Lightning Network combined with the data we classified. We also demonstrate that channel endpoints behave very fairly and rarely cheat, that the same channel endpoints tend not to reconnect after the channel connection has closed and that there are more inactive than active channels in the Lightning Network. As a contribution to the research community, we will release our experimental data together with this paper. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

However, traditional block-based blockchain techniques, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are not suitable for IoT environments due to their low throughput, high computation overhead, and costly transaction fee. To satisfy the requirements of IoT environments, directed-acyclic-graph (DAG)-based approaches, aiming to provide cheap blockchain services with low latency and high throughput, are emerging. This article presents a set of comprehensive experimental studies on IOTA, a representative DAG-based blockchain. We aim to exhibit its unique characteristics mainly from three aspects: 1) performance; 2) security; and 3) system robustness. We have developed a series of benchmark tools and judiciously selected typical configurations to perform experimental examinations with a real private IOTA network. Our studies reveal several interesting findings: 1) the throughput of IOTA is higher than the traditional block-based blockchain but far less than the reported thousands of transactions per second (TPS) in its whitepaper, even with scaling-up configurations; 2) the database query heavily impacts the performance of IOTA, even more than its mining [i.e., Proof of Work (PoW)] process; and 3) the system robustness of IOTA is closely related to the frequency of the incoming transactions while the milestone sent by the centralized coordinator has little effect on the system robustness. We make our benchmark tools public and expect our works can inspire system architects, application designers, and practitioners with new optimization directions and potential application cases for further exploration.","[Wang, Tianyu; Wang, Qian; Shen, Zhaoyan; Jia, Zhiping] Shandong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266000, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tianyu; Shao, Zili] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","","Shen, ZY (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266000, Shandong, Peoples R China.","tywang@cse.cuhk.edu.hk; daisy_seven@163.com; shenzhaoyan@sdu.edu.cn; jzp@sdu.edu.cn; shao@cse.cuhk.edu.hk","","Shen, Zhaoyan/0000-0001-9526-6634; Shao, Zili/0000-0002-2173-2847","National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China [61902218]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [92064008]; Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China [GRF 15224918]; Chinese University of Hong Kong [4055151]","National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Chinese University of Hong Kong(Chinese University of Hong Kong)","This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China under Grant 61902218; in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 92064008; in part by the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, under Grant GRF 15224918; and in part by Direct Grant for Research, The Chinese University of Hong Kong under Project 4055151.

With the rapid increase in popularity of cryptocurrencies ' transactions it is necessary to adopt a unified approach to this novel, 21st century phenomenon. Since 2009, when the first cryptocurrency Bitcoin was created, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have appeared. As the transactions with cryptocurrencies have increased, national and multinational jurisdictions started to deal with issues concerning taxation and accounting for the cryptocurrency. Multinational jurisdictions and professional institutions differ in their opinions about cryptocurrencies. There are opinions considering cryptocurrency a financial asset, a financial instrument, cash, cash equivalents, inventories or intangible asset. As there is no accounting standard within IFRS specifically addressing cryptocurrency, it is necessary to look at the existing IFRS and apply a principles-based approach. The aim of the paper is to compare the accounting of cryptocurrencies in Slovakia with the requirements and/or recommendations by other standards setters and authorities. Slovakia is selected as it is one of the first countries launching accounting regulation for cryptocurrency. The analysis and comparison are used as the main scientific methods in this study. The IFRS IC in June 2019 concluded that IAS 2 applies to cryptocurrencies when they are held for sale in the ordinary course of business. If IAS 2 is not applicable, holdings of cryptocurrencies should be accounted for under IAS 38. The Slovak Republic is applying different approach to holdings of cryptocurrency, the cryptocurrency is considered the short-term financial asset. Difference between Slovak and multinational solution is even in questions of cryptocurrency ' s measurement.","[Blahusiakova, Miriama] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Econ Informat, Dept Accounting & Auditing, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia","","Blahusiakova, M (corresponding author), Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Econ Informat, Dept Accounting & Auditing, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.","miriama.blahusiakova@euba.sk","","","VEGA [1/0121/21 Analyza vplyvu krizy suvisiacej s COVID-19]","VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)European Commission)","The paper was supported by VEGA No 1/0121/21 Analyza vplyvu krizy suvisiacej s COVID-19 na financne zdravie subjektov v Slovenskej republike (The Analysis of Impact of Crises Related to COVID-19 on Financial Health of Entities in the Slovak Republic","","39","1","1","10","13","UNIV ECONOMICS & HUMAN SCIENCES WARSAW","WARSAW","OKOPOWA 59, WARSAW, 01-043, POLAND","2084-0845","2300-8814","","CONTEMP ECON","Contemp.

Among these, we are mainly interested in virtual cryptocurrencies. Virtual cryptocurrency is one of the application directions of blockchain technology. Its essence is a distributed shared ledger database, which generally has the characteristics of decentralization and non-tampering. The technologies supporting the practical application of virtual cryptocurrencies involve multiple scientific and technological fields such as mathematical algorithms, cryptography, Internet communication, and computer software. Since the launch of the first virtual cryptocurrency bitcoin in 2009, it has developed rapidly worldwide. As of August 1, 2021, more than 11,570 virtual cryptocurrencies have been publicly issued and traded globally, with a total value of over $1.68 trillion. This paper proposes the virtual cryptocurrency trading popularity value system as a standardized index for quantitative analysis of virtual cryptocurrency trading, and the virtual cryptocurrency trading index system as a barometer of the virtual cryptocurrency trading market. It has contributed schemes to the analysis of the market rules of virtual cryptocurrency transactions and the realization and early warning of abnormal virtual cryptocurrency transactions, which are the two main hot research directions of virtual cryptocurrency. To be specific, the popularity value of virtual cryptocurrency transactions provides parameters for analyzing individual virtual cryptocurrencies, and the popularity index of virtual cryptocurrency transactions provides parameters for analyzing the virtual cryptocurrency trading market, so as to prevent major risks of virtual cryptocurrency transactions.","[Zhu, Tong] Tongji Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Tong; Liao, Chenyang; Zhou, Ziyang; Li, Xinyu; Zhang, Qingfu] Minist Publ Secur, Res Inst 3, Shanghai, Peoples R China","","Zhu, T (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Zhu, T (corresponding author), Minist Publ Secur, Res Inst 3, Shanghai, Peoples R China.","zhutong.gass@gmail.com","","","","","","","50","0","0","4","12","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","2296-424X","","","FRONT PHYS-LAUSANNE","Front.

A detection node (i.e., collector) should discover available routes to a collection node for data collection and collect security-related data during route discovery for determining reliable routes. However, few studies provide incentives for security-related data collection in MANETs. In this article, we propose B4SDC, a blockchain system for security-related data collection in MANETs. Through controlling the scale of Route REQuest (RREQ) forwarding in route discovery, the collector can constrain its payment and simultaneously make each forwarder of control information (namely RREQs and Route REPlies, in short RREPs) obtain rewards as much as possible to ensure fairness. At the same time, B4SDC avoids collusion attacks with cooperative receipt reporting, and spoofing attacks by adopting a secure digital signature. Based on a novel Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism by accumulating stakes through message forwarding, B4SDC not only provides incentives for all participating nodes, but also avoids forking and ensures high efficiency and real decentralization. We analyze B4SDC in terms of incentives and security, and evaluate its performance through simulations. The thorough analysis and experimental results show the efficacy and effectiveness of B4SDC.","[Liu, Gao; Dong, Huidong; Yan, Zheng] Xidian Univ, Sch Cyber Engn, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks, Xian 710126, Peoples R China; [Yan, Zheng] Aalto Univ, Dept Commun & Networking, Espoo 02150, Finland; [Zhou, Xiaokang; Shimizu, Shohei] Shiga Univ, Fac Data Sci, Hikone 5228522, Japan; [Zhou, Xiaokang; Shimizu, Shohei] RIKEN, Ctr Adv Intelligence Project, Tokyo, Japan","","Yan, Z (corresponding author), Xidian Univ, Sch Cyber Engn, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks, Xian 710126, Peoples R China.","986976804@qq.com; 784156312@qq.com; zhengyan.pz@gmail.com; zhou@biwako.shiga-u.ac.jp; shohei-shimizu@biwako.shiga-u.ac.jp","","Yan, Zheng/0000-0002-9697-2108; SHIMIZU, Shohei/0000-0002-1931-0733","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61672410, 61802293, U1536202]; Academy of Finland [308087, 314203]; Key Lab of Information Network Security, Ministry of Public Security [C18614]; National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents [BX20180238]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M633461]; shaanxi inovation team project [2018TD-007]; 111 project [B16037]; open grant of the Tactical Data Link Lab of the 20th Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, P.R.

There are many acts of fraud, which makes it impossible to trace the data sources of enterprise financial information and relevant personnel. According to the fact that most staff are unable to complete accurate queries on the required financial statements, there are serious problems of nonstandard behavior and lack of key information in the financial statements of these enterprises. Because many comparable challenges have not been handled adequately, it has always made financial information management more complex for businesses, posed a threat to the whole industry's ecosystem, and harmed the interest of many stakeholders, among other things. Due to the qualities of blockchain, such as centralization, anonymity, trustworthiness, and willfulness, which make information difficult to forecast and tamper with, blockchain has gotten a lot of attention in recent years, and bitcoin and other digital currencies have grown popular. Because these characteristics are related to the information storage security and information transmission speed required by enterprise financial information management, blockchain has become a new idea to solve problems related to enterprise financial information management, according to current application and exploration. The overall management system incorporating blockchain technology is created in detail with the financial management system architecture and data processing scheme provided by blockchain technology in order to build an open and secure transmission mechanism for blockchain data.

While most of the breakthroughs in this area have offered great benefits, unintended negative consequences have also resulted. One example of the latter is the surge in illicit drug trafficking using the dark web and other internet-based techniques. Two key reasons for this surge are the anonymity of offenders and the diversity of internet-based trading platforms. Recent developments have shown that cybercriminals have made considerable use of the dark web to expand illicit drug trafficking globally, which has become a source of concern. According to global surveys, a substantial percentage of participants confessed to buying illicit drugs online. Law enforcement agencies are constantly undertaking surveillance operations to track and disrupt mass criminals and prevent crime on the dark web. The closure of major online drug trafficking platforms, on the other hand, has a minimal long-term impact on drug sales on the dark web market because customers and suppliers migrate to other trade platforms and overall sales eventually recover, highlighting the importance of a technologically robust intergovernmental regulatory framework. In this context, this article seeks to address and analyze the following issues: First, we provide an overview of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Second, we explain the methods of purchasing drugs over the dark web. Finally, the paper concludes by discussing the future of the Dark Web and will propose some solutions and recommendations to regulate drug trafficking over the dark web.","[Chawki, Mohamed] Naif Arab Univ Secur Sci NAUSS, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","","Chawki, M (corresponding author), Naif Arab Univ Secur Sci NAUSS, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","chawki@cybercrime-fr.org","","","","","","","55","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1938-7741","1938-775X","","J TRANSP SECUR","J.

This has led investors from the general population to the institutional ones, to become skeptical in venturing in the cryptocurrency market, adding to its highly volatile characteristic. It is then of vital interest to investigate the life span of available coins and tokens, and to evaluate their level of survivability. This will make investors more knowledgeable and hence build their confidence in hazarding in the cryptocurrency market. Survival analysis approach is well suited to provide the needed information. In this study, we discuss the survival outcomes of coins and tokens from the first release of a cryptocurrency in 2009. Non-parametric methods of time-to-event analysis namely Aalen Additive Hazards Model (AAHM) trough counting and martingale processes, Cox Proportional Hazard Model (CPHM) are based on six covariates of interest. Proportional hazards assumption (PHA) is checked by assessing the Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival functions at the levels of each covariate. The results in different regression models display significant and non-significant covariates, relative risks and standard errors.Among the results, it was found that cryptocurrencies under standalone blockchain were at a relatively higher risk of collapsing. It was also found that the 2013-2017 cryptocurrencies release was at a high risk as compared to 2009-2013 release and that cryptocurrencies for which headquarters are known had the relatively better survival outcomes. This provides clear indicators to watch out for while selecting the coins or tokens in which to invest.","[Gatabazi, Paul] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Sci, Dept Math & Appl Math, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Gatabazi, Paul] Univ Rwanda, Coll Business & Econ, Sch Econ, Dept Appl Stat, Huye 124, Rwanda; [Kabera, Gaetan] Univ South Africa UNISA, Dept Stat, ZA-0003 Pretoria, South Africa; [Mba, Jules Clement] Univ Johannesburg, Coll Business & Econ, Sch Econ, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Pindza, Edson] Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept Math & Stat, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Pindza, Edson] Univ Pretoria, Dept Math & Appl Math, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Melesse, Sileshi Fanta] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Math Stat & Comp Sci, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa","","Gatabazi, P (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Fac Sci, Dept Math & Appl Math, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.;Gatabazi, P (corresponding author), Univ Rwanda, Coll Business & Econ, Sch Econ, Dept Appl Stat, Huye 124, Rwanda.","pgatabazi@uj.ac.za; kaberg@unisa.ac.za; jmba@uj.ac.za; pindzaedson@yahoo.fr; melesse@ukzn.ac.za","","Pindza, Edson/0000-0003-3207-8067; Mba, Jules Clement/0000-0001-6462-6385","University of Johannesburg via the Global Excellence and Stature (GES 4.0) scholarship [201281874]","University of Johannesburg via the Global Excellence and Stature (GES 4.0) scholarship","We thank Alex Munyengabe for the great help in data collection and Josiane M.

Recently, the significant increase in the price of digital currencies has persuaded residential customers in many countries to employ CMDs to obtain quick and easy profit. However, these rapidly evolving loads can cause a substantial increase in the coincident peak load of distribution networks. Therefore, it can threaten the safe and reliable operation of the network. A straightforward way to restrict the penetration rate of these home-based miners is to increase the electricity price such that this business becomes unprofitable; however, this solution affects the national regulations and is not practical in many countries. This paper proposes a practical electricity pricing strategy to manage the operation of cryptocurrency mining loads appropriately. This pricing strategy can change the miner' threat to an opportunity to sell more electrical energy during the off-peak hours to these loads and to maximize the profit of the utility. The proposed strategy is studied using the load profile dataset obtained from the measurements of Tehran Electricity Distribution Company, and its effectiveness is demonstrated.","[Hajiaghapour-Moghimi, Mehran; Hosseini, Kamyar Azimi; Hajipour, Ehsan; Vakilian, Mehdi] Sharif Univ Technol, Ctr Excellence Power Syst Management & Control, Dept Elect Engn, Tehran 1136511155, Iran","","Hajipour, E (corresponding author), Sharif Univ Technol, Ctr Excellence Power Syst Management & Control, Dept Elect Engn, Tehran 1136511155, Iran.","mehran.hajiaghapour@sharif.edu; kamyar.azimi@ee.sharif.edu; e_hajipour@sharif.edu; vakilian@sharif.ir","Azimi Hosseini, Kamyar/ABI-8416-2020","Azimi Hosseini, Kamyar/0000-0002-8706-3842; Vakilian, Mehdi/0000-0003-2925-5077","","","","","37","1","1","0","0","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","1949-3053","1949-3061","","IEEE T SMART GRID","IEEE Trans.

Design/methodology/approach The author employs a time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) in combination with an extended joint connectedness approach. Findings The pandemic shocks appear to have influences on the system-wide dynamic connectedness, which reaches a peak during the COVID-19 pandemic. Net total directional connectedness suggests that each cryptocurrency and stock have a heterogeneous role, conditional on their internal characteristics and external shocks. In particular, Bitcoin and Binance Coin are reported as the net receiver of shocks, while the role of Ethereum shifts from receivers to transmitters. As for the stock market, the US stock market stays persistent as net transmitters of shocks, while the Asian stock market (including Hong Kong and Shanghai) are the two consistent net receivers. During the COVID-19 pandemic shock, pairwise connectedness reveals that cryptocurrencies can explain the volatility of the stock markets with the impact most severe at the beginning of 2020. Practical implications Insightful knowledge about key antecedents of contagion among these markets also help policymakers design adequate policies to reduce these markets' vulnerabilities and minimize the spread of risk or uncertainty across these markets. Originality/value The author is the first to investigate the interlinkages between the cryptocurrency and the stock market and assess the influences of uncertain events like the COVID-19 health crisis on the dynamic interlinkages among these two markets. The author employs the TVP-VAR combined with an extended joint connectedness approach.","[Le Thanh Ha] Natl Econ Univ, Fac Econ, Hanoi, Vietnam","","Ha, LT (corresponding author), Natl Econ Univ, Fac Econ, Hanoi, Vietnam.","halethanh.kt@gmail.com","","","National Economics University","National Economics University","This paper was supported by National Economics University.","","39","1","1","5","5","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","0144-3585","","","J ECON STUD","","","","","","","","","","","","","10.1108/JES-01-2022-0055","http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JES-01-2022-0055","","MAR 2022","22","Economics","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Business & Economics","0A7NW","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000774137400001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this brief, we make use of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to solve the account classification problem in Ethereum. We model the Ethereum transaction records as a large-scale transaction network and find that the network is with high heterophily, in which accounts with different features and different labels are connected. In order to solve this problem, we propose a GCN-based model called EH-GCN. The experimental results on a realistic Ethereum dataset show that the proposed method achieves the most advanced classification performance, and results on benchmarks show it produces a competitive performance under homophily.","[Huang, Tao; Wu, Jiajing] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Lin, Dan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Software Engn, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China","","Wu, JJ (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.","wujiajing@mail.sysu.edu.cn","","Lin, Dan/0000-0001-7067-2396","National Key R&D Program of China [2020YFB1006005]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61973325]; Natural Science Foundations of Guangdong Province [2021A1515011661]","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundations of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province)","This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2020YFB1006005; in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61973325; and in part by the Natural Science Foundations of Guangdong Province under Grant 2021A1515011661.

These massive accounts can be divided into diverse categories, such as miners, tokens, and exchanges, which is termed as account diversity in this paper. The benefit of investigating diversity are multi-fold, including understanding the Ethereum ecosystem deeper and opening the possibility of tracking certain abnormal activities. Unfortunately, the exploration of blockchain account diversity remains scarce. Even the most relevant studies, which focus on the deanonymization of the accounts on Bitcoin, can hardly be applied on Ethereum since their underlying protocols and user idioms are different. To this end, we present the first attempt to demystify the account diversity on Ethereum. The key observation is that different accounts exhibit diverse behavior patterns, leading us to propose the heuristics for classification as the premise. We then raise the coverage rate of classification by the statistical learning model Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). We collect real-world data through extensive efforts to evaluate our proposed method and show its effectiveness. Furthermore, we make an in-depth analysis of the dynamic evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem and uncover the abnormal arbitrage actions. As for the former, we validate two sweeping statements reliably: (1) standalone miners are gradually replaced by the mining pools and cooperative miners; (2) transactions related to the mining pool and exchanges take up a large share of the total transactions. The latter analysis shows that there are a large number of arbitrage transactions transferring the coins from one exchange to another to make a price difference.","[Wang, Chaofan; Dai, Xiaohai; Xiao, Jiang; Li, Chenchen; Wen, Ming; Jin, Hai] Natl Engn Res Ctr Big Data Technol & Syst, Serv Comp Technol & Syst Lab, Clusters & Grid Comp Lab, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chaofan; Dai, Xiaohai; Xiao, Jiang; Li, Chenchen; Jin, Hai] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Wen, Ming] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Bingbing] Univ Sydney, Sch Informat Technol, Ctr Distributed & High Performance Comp, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","","Xiao, J (corresponding author), Natl Engn Res Ctr Big Data Technol & Syst, Serv Comp Technol & Syst Lab, Clusters & Grid Comp Lab, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.;Xiao, J (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.","jiangxiao@hust.edu.cn","","","Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province [2020B0101090005]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62072197]","Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (2020B0101090005) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62072197).","","27","0","0","8","29","HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS","BEIJING","CHAOYANG DIST, 4, HUIXINDONGJIE, FUSHENG BLDG, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA","2095-2228","2095-2236","","FRONT COMPUT SCI-CHI","Front..

Direct queries on the blockchain take much time by searching every block, while indirect queries on a blockchain database greatly degrade the authenticity of query results. To conquer the authenticity problem, we propose a Verifiable Query Layer (VQL) that can be deployed in the cloud to provide both efficient and verifiable data query services for blockchain systems. The middleware layer extracts data from the underlying blockchain system and efficiently reorganizes them in databases. To prevent falsified data from being stored in the middleware, a cryptographic fingerprint is calculated based on each constructed database. The database fingerprint will be first verified by miners and then written into the blockchain. Moreover, public users can verify the entire databases or several databases that interest them in the middleware layer. We implement VQL together with the verification schemes and conduct extensive experiments based on a practical blockchain system. The evaluation results demonstrate that VQL can efficiently support various data query services and guarantee the authenticity of query results for blockchain systems.","[Wu, Haotian; Xiao, Bin] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Peng, Zhe] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Guo, Songtao] Chongqing Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yuanyuan] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Comp Engn & Comp Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","","Xiao, B (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","cshtwu@comp.polyu.edu.hk; pengzhe@comp.hkbu.edu.hk; guosongtao@cqu.edu.cn; yuanyuan.yang@stonybrook.edu; csbxiao@comp.polyu.edu.hk","","WU, Haotian/0000-0001-9511-2475; PENG, Zhe/0000-0002-6674-1640","HK RGC GRF PolyU [15217321, PolyU 15216220, HK ITF ITS/081/18]; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2020A1515111070]","HK RGC GRF PolyU; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation","This work was supported in part by the HK RGC GRF PolyU 15217321 and PolyU 15216220, the HK ITF ITS/081/18, and Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation 2020A1515111070.","","30","7","7","22","38","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA","1045-9219","1558-2183","","IEEE T PARALL DISTR","IEEE Trans.

Block generation constitutes the basis of this technology, and the optimization of such systems is among the most crucial concerns. Determining either the block size or the number of transactions in the block brings out a remarkable problem that has been solved by the miners in recent years. First, higher block size results in higher transaction time, on the other hand, smaller block size has many disadvantages such as security, lower transaction fees, lower transaction numbers in a given time interval, which makes it unable to compete with other currency systems due to this bulky structure and higher block generation time. In this study, multiobjective optimization problem (OP) is proposed by minimizing block generation and transmission time. This multiobjective OP is transformed into a single OP by applying weighted sum method. To determine the optimal block size, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and whale optimization evolutionary algorithm (WOA) are employed. Although both algorithms have capability to reach optimum block size and corresponding time, WOA achieves better performance than PSO in terms of the convergence speed and output fluctuation. Moreover, analysis of the prediction of optimum block size is carried out under different weights which creates many optimization functions. Experimental results indicate that if higher weight is assigned to the transmission time, then block size decreases sharply. Furthermore, the experimental results reveal that design of the blockchain network and number of nodes in network profoundly affect the block size selection due to the time constraints.","[Aygun, Betul] Izmir Demokrasi Univ, IIBF, Management Informat Syst, Izmir, Turkey; [Arslan, Hilal] Ankara Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Dept Software Engn, Ankara, Turkey","","Aygun, B (corresponding author), Izmir Demokrasi Univ, IIBF, Management Informat Syst, Izmir, Turkey.","betul.aygun@idu.edu.tr","Arslan, Hilal/AGC-8331-2022","Arslan, Hilal/0000-0002-6449-6952","","","","","30","0","0","7","9","TUBITAK SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL TURKEY","ANKARA","ATATURK BULVARI NO 221, KAVAKLIDERE, ANKARA, 00000, TURKEY","1300-0632","1303-6203","","TURK J ELECTR ENG CO","Turk.

Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) is the collection of systems that enable such communication. Although this data sharing has the potential to improve both the safety and efficiency of vehicles, ensuring that what is shared has not been altered, deleted, forged, leaked, or otherwise tampered with remains a challenging problem. Today, blockchain technology allows a system's participants to come to an agreement (consensus) on the state of the system and its data in a decentralized, trustless manner. This new technology may be capable of securing V2X data, as well as enabling other useful V2X services such as payments. However, the V2X ecosystem poses several unique challenges that complicate the application of blockchain technology, not least of which is the vast number of communications that any proposed blockchain network will need to support. This paper gives an overview of V2X and blockchain technology, explores potential applications of blockchain within the V2X domain, and justifies its importance. It also reviews, analyzes, and discusses various blockchain architectures that could support V2X applications. Though there is a place for blockchain in the V2X environment, currently there is no robust or mature blockchain architecture available that could support the entire ecosystem's needs.

Additive key derivation is a simple mechanism for deriving many subkeys from a single master key, and is already widely used in cryptocurrency applications with the Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet mechanism standardized in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 32 (BIP32). Because of its linear nature, additive key derivation is also amenable to efficient implementation in the threshold setting. With presignatures, the secret and public nonces used in the ECDSA signing algorithm are precomputed. In the threshold setting, using presignatures along with other precomputed data allows for an extremely efficient online phase of the protocol. Recent works have advocated for both of these variations, sometimes combined together. However, somewhat surprisingly, we are aware of no prior security proof for additive key derivation, let alone for additive key derivation in combination with presignatures. In this paper, we provide a thorough analysis of these variations, both in isolation and in combination. Our analysis is in the generic group model (GGM). Importantly, we do not modify ECDSA or weaken the standard notion of security in any way. Of independent interest, we also present a version of the GGM that is specific to elliptic curves. This EC-GGM better models some of the idiosyncrasies (such as the conversion function and malleability) of ECDSA. In addition to this analysis, we report security weaknesses in these variations that apparently have not been previously reported. For example, we show that when both variations are combined, there is a cube-root attack on ECDSA, which is much faster than the best known, square-root attack on plain ECDSA. We also present two mitigations against these weaknesses: re-randomized presignatures and homogeneous key derivation. Each of these mitigations is very lightweight, and when used in combination, the security is essentially the same as that of plain ECDSA (in the EC-GGM).","[Groth, Jens; Shoup, Victor] DFINITY, Zurich, Switzerland","","Shoup, V (corresponding author), DFINITY, Zurich, Switzerland.","jens@dfinity.org; victor.shoup@dfinity.org","","","","","","","21","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-031-06944-4; 978-3-031-06943-7","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2022","13275","","","","","","365","396","","10.1007/978-3-031-06944-4_13","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-06944-4_13","","","32","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Mathematics","BT2LL","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000810488300013","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Such serial execution is unable to exploit modern multi-core resources efficiently, hence limiting the system throughput and increasing the transaction acceptance latency. The objective of this work is to increase the transaction throughput by introducing parallel transaction execution using a static analysis over the transaction dependencies. We propose the DiPETrans framework for distributed execution of transactions in a block. Here, peers in the blockchain network form a community of trusted nodes to execute the transactions and find the PoW in-parallel, using a leader-follower approach. During mining, the leader statically analyzes the transactions, creates different groups (shards) of independent transactions, and distributes them to followers to execute concurrently. After execution, the community's compute power is utilized to solve the PoW concurrently. When a block is successfully created, the leader broadcasts the proposed block to other peers in the network for validation. On receiving a block, the validators re-execute the block transactions and accept the block if they reach the same state as shared by the miner. Validation can also be done in parallel, following the same leader-follower approach as mining. We report experiments using over 5 million real transactions from the Ethereum blockchain and execute them using our DiPETrans framework to empirically validate the benefits of our techniques over a traditional sequential execution. We achieve a maximum speedup of 2.2x and 2.0x and an average speedup of 1.6x and 1.5x for the miner and the validator, respectively, with 100-500 transactions per block when using 6 machines in the community. Further, we achieve a peak of 5x end-to-end block creation speedup using a parallel miner over a serial miner.","[Baheti, Shrey] Cargill Business Serv India Pvt Ltd, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Anjana, Parwat Singh; Peri, Sathya] Indian Inst Technol Hyderabad, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kandi 502285, Telangana, India; [Simmhan, Yogesh] Indian Inst Sci IISc, Dept Computat & Data Sci CDS, Bangalore, Karnataka, India","","Anjana, PS (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Hyderabad, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kandi 502285, Telangana, India.","cs17resch11004@iith.ac.in","Singh, Anjana Parwat/Q-3337-2016","Singh, Anjana Parwat/0000-0002-6574-3871","Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology [4(20)/2019-ITEA, 4(4)/2021-ITEA]","Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology","Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Grant/Award Numbers: 4(20)/2019-ITEA, 4(4)/2021-ITEA","","29","0","0","1","1","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1532-0626","1532-0634","","CONCURR COMP-PRACT E","Concurr.

It promises to enable new applications and solutions to wide-ranging domains. However, today's blockchains suffer from low throughput and high latency. This impedes widespread adoption of more complex blockchain-based applications. We propose a new direction for the future development of blockchains: pushing utmost work to client-side to make the blockchain-core as simple as possible. To show the feasibility and practicability of this idea, we construct both client-assisted consensus and client-assisted smart contracts. The client-assisted consensus only requires a single round-trip between clients and blockchain nodes; it is leaderless and parallelizable. Our experimental results show that it can process thousands of transactions per second when the number of replicas is 400. The client-assisted smart contract pushes the expensive execution to client-side and ensures the correctness by verifiable computation. It avoids duplicated execution, allows parallel execution and reduces transaction/blockchain sizes.","[Liu, Jian; Ren, Kui] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","","Liu, J (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.","liujian2411@zju.edu.cn; kuiren@zju.edu.cn","","","Zhejiang Key RD Plans [2021C01116, 2019C03133]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62002319, U20A20222]; China Zheshang Bank","Zhejiang Key RD Plans; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Zheshang Bank","This work was supported in part by Zhejiang Key R&D Plans under Grant 2021C01116 and Grant 2019C03133, in part by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62002319 and Grant U20A20222, as well as a Grant from China Zheshang Bank.","","25","0","0","7","7","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA","0018-9340","1557-9956","","IEEE T COMPUT","IEEE Trans.

An information-flow based model is adopted for clustering, which itself builds upon an information theoretic measure for computing centrality. Our principal contributions include (1) a generalized model of Markov entropic centrality with the flexibility to tune the importance of node degrees, edge weights and directions, with a closed-form asymptotic analysis, which (2) leads to a novel two-stage graph clustering algorithm. The centrality analysis helps reason about the suitability of our approach to cluster a given graph, and determine 'query' nodes, around which to explore local community structures, leading to an agglomerative clustering mechanism. Our clustering algorithm naturally inherits the flexibility to accommodate edge directionality, as well as different interpretations and interplay between edge weights and node degrees.

Emerging technology like blockchain is used to provide security to systems. Since the inception of blockchain, it has been adopted by researchers and industry both, however, it gained enormous attention after cryptocurrency. It can be defined as a means of storing information in such a way that modification and hacking the system is difficult or impossible. A blockchain is a decentralized ledger that is digital and public, consisting of records of transactions called blocks. A consensus technology assures that all nodes agree on a unique sequence for appending blocks. A comprehensive examination of these algorithms will aid in understanding how and why each blockchain operates in the manner that it does. In this study, we addressed extensively used consensus techniques in the blockchain and the importance of consensus protocol in blockchain technology. The underlying consensus algorithm is a critical component of every blockchain-based system which determine the performance and security of the system. Ensuring the correctness of consensus protocols is uttermost important to create trust in the blockchain-based systems and formal methods are the way to create that trust and develop correct and verified systems. Formal modeling is a method of writing a system mathematically and examining the correctness and verifying the developed system. This study analyzed the importance of consensus mechanisms and how formal methods are helping to develop a correct blockchain-based system. The current scenario of the application of formal methods in the consensus mechanism of blockchain for their verification is presented.","[Verma, Sudhani; Yadav, Divakar; Chandra, Girish] Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Lucknow 226021, Uttar Pradesh, India","","Verma, S (corresponding author), Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Lucknow 226021, Uttar Pradesh, India.","2307@ietlucknow.ac.in","","Verma, Sudhani/0000-0003-4765-9534","","","","","92","1","1","3","3","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","66611","66624","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3184799","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3184799","","","14","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","2O1LZ","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000818829400001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, massive spam transactions cause the participants in blockchain systems to consume many resources in verifying and propagating transactions. This paper proposes a reputation-based mechanism to increase the efficiency of processing transactions by considering the reputations of the sending nodes. Reputations are in turn adjusted based on the quality of transaction processing. Our proposed reputation-based mechanism offers three main contributions. First, we modify the verification strategy so that nodes set a probability of verifying a received transaction considering the likelihood of it being spam: transactions from a node with a low reputation have a high probability of being verified. Second, we optimize the transaction forwarding protocol to reduce propagation delay by prioritizing forwarding transactions to reputable receivers. Third, we design a data request protocol that provides alternative data exchange methods for nodes with different reputations. A series of simulations demonstrate the performance of our reputation-based mechanism.","[Zhang, Jiarui; Yang, Yuanyuan] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Cheng, Yukun] Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Suzhou 215011, Peoples R China; [Deng, Xiaotie] Peking Univ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Nervina Labs Ltd, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Xie, Jan] Hangzhou Cryptape Technol Co Ltd, Hangzhou 310000, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Mengqian] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China","","Zhang, JR (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.","jiarui.zhang.2@stonybrook.edu; ykcheng@amss.ac.cn; xiaotie@pku.edu.cn; cipher@nervos.org; jan@cryptape.com; yuanyuan.yang@stonybrook.edu; mengqian@sjtu.edu.cn","","Deng, Xiaotie/0000-0002-5282-6467","National Natural Science Foundation of China [11871366, 61761146005]; Qing Lan Project for Young Academic Leaders; Qing Lan Project for Key Teachers","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Qing Lan Project for Young Academic Leaders; Qing Lan Project for Key Teachers","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 11871366 and 61761146005, in part by the Qing Lan Project for Young Academic Leaders, and in part by the Qing Lan Project for Key Teachers.","","44","0","0","1","1","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA","0018-9340","1557-9956","","IEEE T COMPUT","IEEE Trans.

T.","","","Tokenized: The Law of Non-Fungible Tokens and Unique Digital Property","INDIANA LAW JOURNAL","","","English","Article","","","","","","","","Markets for unique digital property-digital equivalents of rare artworks, collectible trading cards, and other assets that gain value from scarcity-have exploded in the past few years. At root is the next iteration of blockchain technology, unique digital assets called non-fungible tokens. Unlike bitcoin, where one coin is the same as another, NFTs are unique, each with different attributes. An NFT that represented ownership of Boardwalk would be quite different from one that represented Baltic Avenue. NFTs have grown from a few early breakout successes to a rapidly developing market for unique digital treasures. The attraction to buyers is that, unlike digital assets like e-books or licensed movies, NFTs can be bought, sold, displayed, gifted, or even destroyed just like personal property. Yet law has not kept pace with demand for unique digital property. In particular, the rules designed for the 2000s internet focused on expanding intellectual property licenses and online contracts to the point that consumers are mere users, not owners, of digital assets. This end of ownership legal structure stands in stark contrast to the expectations of those who create, buy, sell, and invest in NFTs. This article proposes a clear path for the evolution of the legal underpinnings of NFTs. It argues that NFTs are personal property, not contracts (despite the smart contracts popular nomenclature) or pure intellectual property licenses (despite the currently governing law of digital assets like e-books). Because transactions in NFTs are in the form of a sale, the law of sales of personal property should apply. And finally, the article notes that NFTs will serve as a powerful, grounding example of digital personal property, a legal form of ownership that is both sorely needed and has not yet been clearly established online. That example will ground others, and permit law to again characterize those who buy scarce and valuable digital assets as true owners rather than mere users.","[Fairfield, Joshua A.

The cluster consists of up to 8 computational units (nodes) with different performances measured in bcrypt hash computations per second [H/s]. In the cluster, nodes are low-power heterogeneous embedded systems with programmable logic containing specialized hash computation accelerators. In the experiments, we used a combination of Xilinx Zynq-series SoC boards and ZTEX 1.15y board which was initially used as a bitcoin miner. Zynq based nodes use the improved version of our custom bcrypt accelerator, which executes the most costly parts of the bcrypt hash computation in programmable logic. The cluster was formed around the famous open-source password cracking software package John the Ripper (abbr. JtR). On the communication layer, we used Message Passing Interface (MPI)library with a standard Ethernet network connecting the nodes. To mitigate the different performances among the cluster nodes and to balance the load, we developed and implemented password candidate distribution scheme based on the passwords' probability distribution, i.e. the order of appearance in the dictionary. We tested individual nodes and the cluster as a whole, trying different combinations of nodes and evaluating our distribution scheme for password candidates. We also compared our cluster with various GPU implementations in terms of performance, energy-efficiency, and price-efficiency. We show that our solution outperforms other platforms such as high-end GPUs, by a factor of at least 3 in terms of energy-efficiency and thus producing less overall cost of password attack than other platforms. In terms of the total operational costs, our cluster pays off after 4500 cracked passwords for a bcrypt hash with cost parameter 12, which makes it more appealing for real-world password-based system attacks. We also demonstrate the scalability of our cCc cluster.","[Pervan, Branimir; Knezovic, Josip; Guberovic, Emanuel] Univ Zagreb, Fac Elect Engn & Comp, Unska 3, Zagreb, Croatia; [Guberovic, Emanuel] Green Light Technol Ltd, Zagreb, Croatia","","Pervan, B (corresponding author), Univ Zagreb, Fac Elect Engn & Comp, Unska 3, Zagreb, Croatia.","branimir.pervan@fer.hr","Pervan, Branimir/ADO-3105-2022","Pervan, Branimir/0000-0003-3803-0910","Croatian-Swiss Research Programme (CSRP) by the Croatian Science Foundation (HRZZ) [IZHRZ0_180625]","Croatian-Swiss Research Programme (CSRP) by the Croatian Science Foundation (HRZZ)","The research was conducted as part of the employment of the authors, namely: ~ Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia (Branimir Pervan, Josip Knezovic, Emanuel Guberovic). ~ Green Light Technologies Ltd., Zagreb, Croatia (Emanuel Guberovic).

Two kinds of players support the currencies differently and choose their volume fractions of transactions in each currency. The variable-supply currency enables money printing/withdrawal and inflation/deflation, which counteract each other in each player's utility. The exponentially increasing 1959-2021 US M2 money supply and the positive inflation cause this utility to increase over time with high weight assigned to money printing/withdrawal, and decrease otherwise. Three replicator equations determine each player's volume fraction of transactions in each currency, and which kind of player each player prefers to be. High weight assigned to money supply relative to inflation induces players to prefer the variable-supply currency. A player's utility of transacting in each currency is proportional to the player's support of that currency, the volume fraction of all players' transactions in that currency, and the fraction of players of the same kind as the given player. A player's utility of transacting in the variable-supply currency is additionally proportional to two ratios. The first is the initial money supply plus the accumulative money printing/withdrawal divided by the initial money supply. The second is the inverse of the accumulative inflation/deflation. The players' fractions of transactions in each currency may be inverse U shaped or U shaped before typically converging towards preferring one or the other currency. If each player can choose which kind of player to be, it may choose to be the kind with the highest support of a given currency. If a player's utility of transacting in a given currency depends more on the fraction of players being of one kind than the other kind, the player prefers to be of the first kind, thus assigning less weight to its support of that currency and the volume fractions of transactions in that currency.","[Wang, Guizhou; Hausken, Kjell] Univ Stavanger, Fac Sci & Technol, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway","","Hausken, K (corresponding author), Univ Stavanger, Fac Sci & Technol, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.","kjell.hausken@uis.no","","Hausken, Kjell/0000-0001-7319-3876","","","","","35","0","0","2","2","SPRINGERNATURE","LONDON","CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND","","2662-9992","","HUM SOC SCI COMMUN","Hum.

Design/methodology/approach To measure the dynamic relationship, it uses the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model of Engle (2002) to consider time variation in UCRY Policy and cryptocurrency returns. The data set encompasses the weekly frequency data of the UCRY Policy and Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), Stellar (XLM), Dash (DASH), Monero (XMR) from 4 September 2016, to 21 February 2021. Findings Empirical findings indicate that the correlations between the UCRY Policy and the BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, XLM, DASH and XMR returns are consistently negative. Thus, an increase in the volatility of the UCRY Policy can lead to a decrease in volatility for BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, XLM, DASH and XMR returns. Besides, these findings indicate that the estimated DCC is not only time-varying but also substantially responsive to salient events, such as China banning ICOs, cryptocurrency exchanges attacks, the Covid-19 pandemic crisis and SEC's announcement about Ripple. Besides, empirical findings show that cryptocurrency returns are adversely impacted by UCRY Policy during the salient events (China bans ICOs, the hack of cryptocurrency exchanges, Covid-19 crisis), suggesting their failure to act as a hedge or safe-haven asset. Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge, this study investigates the time-varying correlation between UCRY Policy and cryptocurrency returns. Besides, this study may be useful for new studies and fill a gap in the finance literature, due to the limited number of studies on the UCRY Policy in the finance literature.","[Karaomer, Yunus] Hatay Mustafa Kemal Univ, Dept Business Adm, Antakya, Turkey","","Karaomer, Y (corresponding author), Hatay Mustafa Kemal Univ, Dept Business Adm, Antakya, Turkey.","yunuskaraomer@mku.edu.tr","","","","","","","55","0","0","4","5","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1086-7376","1755-6791","","STUD ECON FINANC","Stud.

Although just a few cryptocurrencies, or coins, dominate the headlines (bitcoin, ether, etc.), more than 10,000 different coins currently exist. Each coin targets specific problems (inter-user payments, unlocking specific services, etc.) and two key problems in Vietnamese higher education are student motivation and student agency. The argument is that by rewarding particular behaviors (good grades, attendance, etc.) with a grant of coins to each student, the coin can bring the benefits of badging but can go even further because coins, unlike badges, can be spent. One major weakness of cryptocurrencies is that they are like money but with less utility. This paper argues that this weakness can be turned into a strength by making a new coin that is targeted specifically to education. Students with better academic performance would receive more coins than other students. These coins can then be used to purchase exclusive options such as entry to watch or even meet a guest speaker or the student could buy time from the teacher to help them improve their study plan. While teachers do offer office hours, some students are hesitant to attend as they feel they do not deserve to consume the teacher's time, because it was their parents, not the students, who paid the tuition. However, by earning the coins to buy the teacher's time, it is anticipated that students would become more agentic and more willing to take advantage of those resources that have been available yet remain underutilized. Students without coins may be able to buy them from other students at a market price. This can provide even greater motivation for students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to perform well because their reward (the coins) can be exchanged for real world money.","[Andre, John] Natl Econ Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam","","Andre, J (corresponding author), Natl Econ Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam.","john.andre@isneu.org","","","","","","","17","0","0","0","0","INT ASSOC ONLINE ENGINEERING","WIEN","KIRCHENGASSE 10-200, WIEN, A-1070, AUSTRIA","1863-0383","","","INT J EMERG TECHNOL","Int.

As a radical decentralized data management technology, distributed ledger technology (DLT) has the potential to support a trustworthy digital infrastructure facilitating the DNO-DSO transition. Based on a comprehensive review of worldwide research and practice, as well as the engagement of relevant industrial experts, the application of DLT in distribution networks is identified and analyzed in this article. The DLT features and DSO needs are first summarized, and the mapping relationship between them is identified. Detailed DSO functions are identified and classified into five categories (i.e., planning, operation, market, asset, and connection) with the potential of applying DLT to various DSO functions assessed. Finally, the development of seven key DSO functions with high DLT potential is analyzed and discussed from the technical, legal, and social perspectives, including peer-to-peer energy trading, flexibility market facilitation, electric vehicle charging, network pricing, distributed generation register, data access, and investment planning.","[Zhou, Yue; Manea, Andrei Nicolas; Hua, Weiqi; Wu, Jianzhong; Zhou, Wei] Cardiff Univ, Sch Engn, Cardiff CF24 3AA, Wales; [Hua, Weiqi] Univ Oxford, Dept Engn Sci, Oxford OX1 3PJ, England; [Zhou, Wei] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Elect Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; [Yu, James] SP Energy Networks, Glasgow G32 8FA, Lanark, Scotland; [Rahman, Saifur] Virginia Tech, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Arlington, VA 22203 USA","","Wu, JZ (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Engn, Cardiff CF24 3AA, Wales.","zhouy68@cardiff.ac.uk; maneaa@cardiff.ac.uk; weiqi.hua@eng.ox.ac.uk; wuj5@cardiff.ac.uk; zhouwei@dlut.edu.cn; james.yu@scottishpower.com; srahman@vt.edu","","Wu, Jianzhong/0000-0001-7928-3602; Hua, Weiqi/0000-0002-6616-6797; Zhou, Yue/0000-0002-6698-4714","U.K. Network Innovation Allowance through the project Distributed Leger Technology-Enabled Distribution Network Operation (DeDSO); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)/National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [EP/T021969/1/52061635103]","U.K. Network Innovation Allowance through the project Distributed Leger Technology-Enabled Distribution Network Operation (DeDSO); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)/National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","This work was supported in part by the U.K. Network Innovation Allowance through the project Distributed Leger Technology-Enabled Distribution Network Operation (DeDSO) and in part by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)/National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant EP/T021969/1/52061635103 Multi-Energy Control of Cyber-Physical Urban Energy Systems (MC2).

The key objectives are to improve the computation and processing of drone-based resource constraints and deliver the data to the outsourced computational node to schedule, process, manage, optimize, and preserve it since they are located close to each other through a wireless sensor network. This collaborative technological approach to robustness is the standard of drone system design and implementation, reducing the computational power, resource consumption, and latency for the application that needs a fast response. However, recent research into fog-enabled drone-based data management and optimization poses a serious chal-lenge in terms of privacy, security, and preservation. On the other hand, Blockchain Hyperledger Technology, which is mostly used in Bitcoin Cryptocurrencies, has been applied in a large number of distributed applications due to the ledger integrity, transparency, trustworthiness, provenance, reliability, availability, protection, and security-related distributed features that are provided. Therefore, the distributed application of drone control has received more attention because of its ability to handle collaborative procedures to capture, schedule, process, optimize, manage, and preserve drone-based data using fog nodes and blockchain hyperledger technology. In this paper, we proposed a collaborative approach using blockchain hyperledger fabric and a metaheuristic-enabled genetic algorithm for fog node management called B-Drone. This approach handles drone-based data collection, scheduling, optimizing, processing, managing, and preservation in a secure manner in the fog node. The protection of each transaction between drone and fog node before exchange is private with the utilization of the hash-encryption (SHA-256) algorithm. The blockchain smart contracts are implemented and deployed to auto-manage all the connectivity and communication protocols between drones and fog nodes in the designed private permissioned network. The simulations of the proposed collaborative approach reduce the computing cost down to 12.03% and increase the performance up to 73.11%, thus decreasing the cost of drone -ledger preservation down to 30.13% and the robust usage of the network up to 54.29% as compared to other state-of-the-art methods .","[Khan, Abdullah Ayub; Laghari, Asif Ali] Sindh Madressatul Islam Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Karachi 74000, Pakistan; [Khan, Abdullah Ayub; Shaikh, Zaffar Ahmed] Benazir Bhutto Shaheed Univ Lyari, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Karachi 75660, Pakistan; [Gadekallu, Thippa Reddy] Vellore Inst Technol, Chennai, India; [Javed, Abdul Rehman] Air Univ Islamabad, Dept Cyber Secur, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Rashid, Mamoon] Vishwakarma Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Engn, Pune 411048, India; [V.

In this article, an efficient multiattribute-based signature scheme with key aggregation (M-ABS-KA) is presented that supports a flexible threshold predicate. This construction aggregates the public keys and provides a compact signature that is verified as a group, which realizes faster batch verification than confirming them individually. Furthermore, both the multisignature scale and the public key length are independent of the number of signers and attributes in this scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this M-ABS-KA scheme is the first multi-ABS protocol with an aggregated public key and fast batch verification. Based on the hardness of the computational Diffie-Hellman problem, it is formally proven that the proposal achieves unforgeability in the random oracle model and enjoys signer privacy. Additionally, the performance is evaluated in theoretical and experimental analyses with other related ABS schemes, and the results show that it is feasible and efficient in storage, bandwidth, and computational cost. Finally, as an illustrative application, we design a framework of the blockchain-enabled electronic health records assessment system based on this presented M-ABS-KA scheme.","[Guo, Rui; Li, Kemeng; Zhang, Yinghui] Xian Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Cyberspace Secur, Natl Engn Lab Wireless Secur, Xian 710121, Peoples R China; [Guo, Rui] Xidian Univ, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks, Xian 710071, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiong] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Inst Cyber Secur, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China; [Li, Xuelei] Inspur Elect Informat Ind Co Ltd, Jinan 250101, Peoples R China","","Li, X (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Inst Cyber Secur, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China.","guorui@xupt.edu.cn; likemeng2019@163.com; lixiongzhq@163.com; yhzhaang@163.com; will8898@163.com","Li, Xiong/K-7233-2012","Li, Xiong/0000-0001-6619-554X; Guo, Rui/0000-0003-2603-2775; Li, Xuelei/0000-0002-7935-6290","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0802000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62072369, 62072371, 62072078, 61802303, 61772418]; Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi [2020ZDLGY08-04, 2019KW-053]; Innovation Capability Support Program in Shaanxi Province of China [2020KJXX-052, 2017KJXX-47]; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China [2019JQ-866, 2018JZ6001]; Research Program of Education Bureau of Shaanxi Province [19JK0803]; New Star Team of Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications [2016-02]; Basic Research Program of Qinghai Province [2020-ZJ-701]","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi; Innovation Capability Support Program in Shaanxi Province of China; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China; Research Program of Education Bureau of Shaanxi Province; New Star Team of Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications; Basic Research Program of Qinghai Province","This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2017YFB0802000, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62072369, Grant 62072371, Grant 62072078, Grant 61802303, and Grant 61772418, in part by the Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi under Grant 2020ZDLGY08-04 and Grant 2019KW-053, in part by the Innovation Capability Support Program in Shaanxi Province of China under Grant 2020KJXX-052 and Grant 2017KJXX-47, in part by the Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China under Grant 2019JQ-866 and Grant 2018JZ6001, in part by the Research Program of Education Bureau of Shaanxi Province under Grant 19JK0803, in part by the New Star Team of Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications under Grant 2016-02, and in part by the Basic Research Program of Qinghai Province under Grant 2020-ZJ-701.","","29","0","0","5","5","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","1932-8184","1937-9234","","IEEE SYST J","IEEE Syst.

However, despite the advantages, there are various risks associated with these vehicles. These vehicles interact with each other by forming a vehicular network, also known as VANET, in a centralized manner. This centralized network is vulnerable to cyber-attacks which can cause data loss, resulting in road accidents. Thus, to prevent the vehicular network from being attacked and to prevent the privacy of the data, key management is used. However, key management alone over a centralized network is not effective in ensuring data integrity in a vehicular network. To resolve this issue, various studies have introduced a blockchain-based approach and enabled key management over a decentralized network. This technique is also found effective in ensuring the privacy of all the stakeholders involved in a vehicular network. Furthermore, a blockchain-based key management system can also help in storing a large amount of data over a distributed network, which can encourage a faster exchange of information between vehicles in a network. However, there are certain limitations of blockchain technology that may affect the efficient working of autonomous vehicles. Most of the existing blockchain-based systems are implemented over Ethereum or Bitcoin. The transaction-processing capability of these blockchains is in the range of 5 to 20 transactions per second, whereas hashgraphs are capable of processing thousands of transactions per second as the data are processed exponentially. Furthermore, a hashgraph prevents the user from altering the order of the transactions being processed, and they do not need high computational powers to operate, which may help in reducing the overall cost of the system. Due to the advantages offered by a hashgraph, an advanced key management framework based on a hashgraph for secure communication between the vehicles is suggested in this paper. The framework is developed using the concept of Leaving of Vehicles based on a Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) and Batch Rekeying. The system is tested and compared with other closely related systems on the basis of the transaction compilation time and change in traffic rates.","[Jha, Sudan] Christ Deemed Univ, Sch Sci, NCR New Delhi Campus, Ghaziabad 201003, India; [Jha, Nishant; Prashar, Deepak] Lovely Profess Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn SCSE, Dept Networking & Secur, Phagwara 144411, India; [Ahmad, Sultan] Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz Univ, Coll Comp Engn & Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Alkharj 11942, Saudi Arabia; [Alouffi, Bader] Taif Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Sci, POB 11099, At Taif 21944, Saudi Arabia; [Alharbi, Abdullah] Taif Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Technol, Dept Informat Technol, POB 11099, At Taif 21944, Saudi Arabia","","Ahmad, S (corresponding author), Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz Univ, Coll Comp Engn & Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Alkharj 11942, Saudi Arabia.","jhasudan@ieee.org; nishantjha1998@outlook.com; deepak.prashar@lpu.co.in; s.alisher@psau.edu.sa; balouffi@tu.edu.sa; amharbi@tu.edu.sa","Prashar, Deepak/X-6485-2019; Jha, Sudan/P-9823-2018; Ahmad, Sultan/F-9146-2010","Prashar, Deepak/0000-0002-8786-1115; Jha, Sudan/0000-0003-0074-2584; Ahmad, Sultan/0000-0002-3198-7974; Alouffi, Bader/0000-0001-7759-0940","Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia [TURSP-2020/314]","Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia","This research received funding by Researchers Supporting Project number (TURSP-2020/314), Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia.","","42","1","1","1","1","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1424-8220","","SENSORS-BASEL","Sensors","APR","2022","22","7","","","","","","","2529","10.3390/s22072529","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22072529","","","13","Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation","0K6TQ","35408144","Green Published, gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000780924100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, these algorithms suffer a vulnerability that, when one derived key is compromised somehow, the damage is not limited to the leaked derived key only, but to the master key and in consequence all derived keys are compromised. In this article, we introduce and formalize a new signature variant, called Key-Insulated and Privacy-Preserving Signature Scheme with Publicly Derived Public Key (PDPKS), which fully captures and improves the functionality, security, and privacy requirements of DW and SA. We propose a PDPKS construction and prove its security and privacy in the random oracle model. Furthermore, we implement the construction with parameters for 128-bit security, and the results show that it is practically efficient for the setting of cryptocurrencies. With its solid guarantee on functionality, security and privacy, as well as its practical efficiency, our PDPKS construction provides a practical cryptographic tool that refines DW and SA, without security vulnerability.","[Liu, Zhen] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Yang, Guomin] Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Wong, Duncan S.] CryptoBLK, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Khoa Nguyen; Wang, Huaxiong] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Phys & Math Sci, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Ke, Xiaorong] Huawei Technol Co Ltd, Shenzhen 518129, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yining] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA","","Liu, Z (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.","liuzhen@sjtu.edu.cn; gyang@uow.edu.au; duncanwong@cryptoblk.io; khoantt@ntu.edu.sg; HXWang@ntu.edu.sg; kexiaorong@sjtu.edu.cn; ynyn24@sjtu.edu.cn","","Wang, Huaxiong/0000-0002-7669-8922; Yang, Guomin/0000-0002-4949-7738; Nguyen, Khoa/0000-0001-8555-638X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [62072305, 61672339]; National Cryptography Development Fund [MMJJ20170111]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2020YFA0309705]; Foundation of Science and Technology on Information Assurance Laboratory [KJ-17-109]; Gopalakrishnan-NTU Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship 2018; National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, through it's Strategic Capability Research Centres Funding Initiative; Singapore Ministry of Education [MOE2016-T2-2-014]; Abelian Foundation","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Cryptography Development Fund; National Key Research and Development Program of China; Foundation of Science and Technology on Information Assurance Laboratory; Gopalakrishnan-NTU Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship 2018; National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, through it's Strategic Capability Research Centres Funding Initiative; Singapore Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Abelian Foundation","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62072305 and 61672339, in part by the National Cryptography Development Fund under Grant MMJJ20170111, in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2020YFA0309705, in part by the Foundation of Science and Technology on Information Assurance Laboratory under Grant KJ-17-109, in part by the Gopalakrishnan-NTU Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship 2018, in part by the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, through it's Strategic Capability Research Centres Funding Initiative, in part by the Singapore Ministry of Education under Grant MOE2016-T2-2-014 (S), and in part by the Abelian Foundation.

It has guided humankind in managing all matters of life in this world and hereafter, and so do financial matters. Cryptocurrency is a digital way of exchanging currency and a digital payment network based on blockchain technology. Over the last several decades, the technological and digital revolution has resulted in the creation and deployment of novel payment systems, with cryptocurrency being one of the most significant breakthrough payment methods for both commercial and personal use. Digital finance, specifically cryptocurrency, has become a phenomenon in the 21st century. Cryptocurrency is perceived as ready to be an alternative to fiat currency. This study discussed themes that can be used as guidelines for Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) to get themselves equipped once legally accepted globally. Despite the fact that there are currently over 2,000 cryptocurrencies on the market, Bitcoin is still the most well-known and was the first cryptocurrency coin to go mainstream. The problem for Muslims is whether cryptocurrency payment platforms are halal in Allah's and in accordance with Shariah principles. Blockchain technology should not be blamed as a cause for this matter. Blockchains function as a ledger system, and the fact that it is practically impossible to hack, modify, or cheat the blockchain platform or marketplace is why this technology is so significant. The use of blockchain technology eliminates the necessity for centralised financial organisations and businesses, as no central control is necessary. It even becomes a matter of kifayah obligations for Muslims to master it. However, it raises Shariah's concerns on cryptocurrency's validity due to control and gharar issues. This study employed a qualitative approach to gather information about issues of readiness using cryptocurrency for zakat. Ten experts who were actively involved as academicians and industry participated in a semi-structured interview session. The study's findings discovered five major tenets, namely Knowledge, Security, economics, Improvisation, and Technology, that was successfully explored to the saturation point and is used as a guideline for the readiness to accept cryptocurrency in zakat transaction.

The starting point for these processes is a source of randomness that participants cannot manipulate. This paper proposes two methods for embedding random number seeds in a blockchain data structure to serve as inputs to pseudo-random number generators. Because the output of a pseudo-random number generator depends deterministically on its seed, the properties of the seed are critical to the quality of the eventual pseudo-random number produced. Our protocol, B-Rand, embeds random number seeds that are confidential, tamper-resistant, unpredictable, collision-resistant, and publicly verifiable as part of every transaction. These seeds may then be used by transaction owners to participate in processes in the blockchain system that require pseudo-random numbers. Both the Single Secret and Double Secret B-Rand protocols are highly scalable with low space and computational cost, and the worst case is linear in the number of transactions per block.","[Bezuidenhout, Riaan; Nel, Wynand] Univ Free State, Dept Comp Sci & Informat, ZA-9301 Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Maritz, Jacques M.] Univ Free State, Dept Engn Sci, ZA-9301 Bloemfontein, South Africa","","Bezuidenhout, R (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Dept Comp Sci & Informat, ZA-9301 Bloemfontein, South Africa.","bezuidenhoutr@ufs.ac.za","","Nel, Wynand/0000-0001-5579-6411; Maritz, Jacques/0000-0003-1556-8523; Bezuidenhout, Riaan/0000-0002-5412-7512","","","","","58","0","0","1","1","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","39912","39925","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3165616","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3165616","","","14","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","3Q6VR","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000838366800001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

On the other hand, blockchain is the revolutionary invention of the twentieth century that offers a distributed and decentralized setting to communicate among nodes in a list of networks without a central authority. It can address the limitations of EHRs management and provide a safer, secured, and decentralized environment for exchanging EHRs data. Three categories of blockchain-based potential solutions have been proposed by researchers to handle EHRs: conceptual, prototype, and implemented. This study focused on a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to find and analyze articles submitted either conceptual or implemented to manage EHRs using blockchain. The study examined 99 papers that were collected from various publication categories. The deep technical analysis focused on evaluating articles based on privacy, security, scalability, accessibility, cost, consensus algorithms, and the type of blockchain used. The SLR found that blockchain technology promises to provide decentralization, security, and privacy that traditional EHRs often lack. Moreover, results obtained from the detailed studies would provide potential researchers with the type of blockchain for future research. Finally, future research directions, in the end, would direct enthusiasm to combine new blockchain-based systems to manage EHRs properly.","[Al Mamun, Abdullah] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Engn & Comp Sci, Wellington 6012, New Zealand; [Azam, Sami] Charles Darwin Univ, Coll Engn IT & Environm, Casuarina, NT 0810, Australia; [Gritti, Clementine] Univ Canterbury, Comp Sci & Software Engn, Christchurch 8041, New Zealand","","Azam, S (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Univ, Coll Engn IT & Environm, Casuarina, NT 0810, Australia.","sami.azam@cdu.edu.au","","Mamun, Abdullah Al/0000-0002-9016-7802; Azam, Sami/0000-0001-7572-9750; Gritti, Clementine/0000-0002-0835-8678","","","","","160","2","2","21","32","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","5768","5789","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3141079","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3141079","","","22","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","YJ4IG","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000744496300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

By allowing Turing-complete programming languages to implement smart contracts, recent blockchains such as Ethereum can reduce needs in trusted intermediators, arbitrations and enforcement costs. However, subtle errors in smart contracts have induced an enormous financial loss-for examples, the DAO attack, Parity multisignature wallet attacks, and integer underflow/overflow attacks. To identify such errors in smart contracts, various researches are performed, which are based on static analysis and theorem proving. However, they only support inspection for pre-defined error patterns, or they cannot explore the whole searching space exhaustively or be fully automatic. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel formal verification technique to analyze blockchain smart contracts by using ATL model checking. In our methodology, we represent the interaction between users and smart contracts into a two-player game and verify properties we want to check using MCMAS that is an efficient ATL model checker for multi-agent systems. Moreover, we present three case studies to show that our proposal can successfully identify subtle flaws in real world smart contracts.","[Nam, Wonhong] Konkuk Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 05029, South Korea; [Kil, Hyunyoung] Korea Aerosp Univ, Dept Software, Goyang 10540, South Korea","","Kil, H (corresponding author), Korea Aerosp Univ, Dept Software, Goyang 10540, South Korea.","hykil@kau.ac.kr","","","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant through the Korea Government (MSIT) [2019R1F1A106282813, 2021R1F1A105038911]","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant through the Korea Government (MSIT)","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant through the Korea Government (MSIT) under Grant 2019R1F1A106282813 and Grant 2021R1F1A105038911.","","43","0","0","4","4","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2022","10","","","","","","8151","8162","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3143145","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3143145","","","12","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","YN4BC","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000747203600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The advantage of blockchain is decentralization, and the most important thing in a decentralized system is how to make nodes reach a consensus quickly. This research mainly discusses the blockchain and K-means algorithm for edge AI computing. The natural pan-central distributed trustworthiness of blockchain provides new ideas for designing the framework and paradigm of edge AI computing. In edge AI computing, multiple devices running AI algorithms are scattered across the edge network. When it comes to decentralized management, blockchain is the underlying technology of the Bitcoin system. Due to its characteristics of immutability, traceability, and consensus mechanism of transaction data storage, it has recently received extensive attention. Blockchain technology is essentially a public ledger. This is done by recording data related to trust management to this ledger. To collaboratively complete artificial intelligence computing tasks or jointly make intelligent group decisions, frequent communication is required between these devices. By integrating idle computing resources in an area, a distributed edge computing platform is formed. Users obtain benefits by sharing their computing resources, and nodes in need complete computing tasks through the shared platform. In view of the identity security problems faced in the sharing process, this article introduces blockchain technology to realize the trust between users. All participants must register a secure identity in the blockchain network and conduct transactions in this security system. A K-means algorithm suitable for edge environments is proposed to identify different degradation stages of equipment operation reflected by multiple types of data. Based on the prediction of the fault state for a single type of data, the algorithm uses the historical data of multiple types of data together with the prediction data to predict the fault stage. During the research process, the average optimization energy consumption of K-means algorithm is 14.6% lower than that of GA. On the basis of designing a resource allocation scheme based on blockchain, the problem of how the participants can realize reliable resource use according to the recorded data on the chain is studied. The article implements the verification of the legality of the use of blockchain resources. In addition, a control node is introduced to master the global real-time information of the network to provide data support for the user's choice.","[Qiu, Xiaotian; Yao, Dengfeng; Kang, Xinchen] Beijing Union Univ, Beijing Key Lab Informat Serv Engn, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Xiaotian] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Abulizi, Abudukelimu] Xinjiang Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Informat Management, Urumqi 830012, Xinjiang, Peoples R China","","Yao, DF (corresponding author), Beijing Union Univ, Beijing Key Lab Informat Serv Engn, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.","202021080824@std.uestc.edu.cn; tjtdengfeng@buu.edu.cn; kxc4088@163.com; keram1106@163.com","","","Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation [4202028]; National Social Science Foundation of China [21BYY106]; Premium Funding Project for Academic Human Resources Development in Beijing Union University [BPHR2019CZ05]; Jiangsu Province Key R&D Program (Industry Prospects and Key Core Technologies) [BE2020047]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62036001, 61866035, 61966033]","Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); National Social Science Foundation of China; Premium Funding Project for Academic Human Resources Development in Beijing Union University; Jiangsu Province Key R&D Program (Industry Prospects and Key Core Technologies); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation (4202028), National Social Science Foundation of China (21BYY106), Premium Funding Project for Academic Human Resources Development in Beijing Union University (BPHR2019CZ05), Jiangsu Province Key R & D Program (Industry Prospects and Key Core Technologies) (BE2020047), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (62036001, 61866035, and 61966033).","","25","0","0","8","8","HINDAWI LTD","LONDON","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","1687-5265","1687-5273","","COMPUT INTEL NEUROSC","Comput.

Despite its contribution, the current cloud-based architecture may cause severe data leakage or jeopardize user privacy. Meanwhile, the cloud-based architecture heavily relies on a trusted third-party auditor (TPA) and runs in a centralized control manner. However, the TPA may not be a completely trustworthy entity, and a single point of failure might cause the centralized system to collapse. Fortunately, with the advent of blockchain technology, the decentralized storage model has gained popularity. A decentralized storage system successfully eradicates the rule of TPA, solves the problem of a single point of failure, and has many advantages over a centralized control architecture, such as low storage prices and high throughput. This study offers a blockchain-based decentralized distributed storage and sharing scheme that provides end-to-end encryption and fine-grained access control. In our proposed IoTChain model, fine-grained permission is based on attribute-based access control (A-BAC) policy by employing the Ethereum blockchain as an auditable access control layer. Smart contracts are tailored for the IoTChain model, which combines the Ethereum blockchain and the interplanetary file system (IPFS). We used an advanced encryption standard (AES) for encryption and the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol for secret key sharing between data owners and users. Also, the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism is replaced with a proof-of-authority (PoA) to minimize system transaction cost and boost system throughput.

Blockchain technology is heading in the direction of systematic innovation and revolution. It is a digital ledger of transactions, and every block contains information of transactions linked by cryptographic references. Every block covers information and maintains trust among people based on how far they are. Blockchain is a system used for storing data, and it ensures the security of the system. The resurgence in blockchain technology has encouraged scholars and specialists over the past couple of years to carefully examine new ways of implementing blockchain technology with a wide range in the domain of healthcare. This rapid increase in blockchain technology has generated many endless possibilities. In this article, we provide a review of blockchain technology in healthcare. We present a detailed introduction, history, technical information, and types of blockchain technology. Motivations behind this technology and top healthcare projects completed using this technology are also discussed. This article is classified into three groups based on blockchain applications with their use cases. The evaluation of medical care technologies and relevant applications based on blockchain technology, such as sharing electronic medical records, remote patient monitoring, and supply chain management, are also discussed.

Blockchain systems are inherently interdisciplinary since they combine various fields such as cryptography, multi-agent systems, distributed systems, social systems, economy, and finance. Furthermore, they have a very active and dynamic ecosystem where new blockchain platforms and algorithms are developed continuously due to the interest of the public and the industries to the technology. Consequently, we anticipate a challenging and interdisciplinary research agenda in blockchain systems, built upon a methodology that strives to capture the rich process resulting from the interplay between the behavior of agents and the dynamic interactions among them. To be effective, however, modeling studies providing insights into blockchain systems, and appropriate description of agents paired with a generic understanding of their components are needed. Such studies will create a more unified field of blockchain systems that advances our understanding and leads to further insight. According to this perspective, in this study, we propose using a generic multi-agent organizational modeling for studying blockchain systems, namely AGR4BS. Concretely, we use the Agent/Group/Role (AGR) organizational modeling approach to identify and represent the generic entities which are common to blockchain systems. We show through four real case studies how this generic model can be used to model different blockchain systems. We also show briefly how it can be used for modeling three well-known attacks on blockchain systems.","[Roussille, Hector; Gurcan, Onder] Univ Paris Saclay, LIST, CEA, F-91120 Palaiseau, France; [Roussille, Hector; Michel, Fabien] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, LIRMM, F-34095 Montpellier, France","","Gurcan, O (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, LIST, CEA, F-91120 Palaiseau, France.","hector.roussille@cea.fr; onder.gurcan@cea.fr; fmichel@lirmm.fr","","Michel, Fabien/0000-0003-1814-980X; Roussille, Hector/0000-0003-1419-0346","","","","","73","1","1","3","3","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2504-2289","","BIG DATA COGN COMPUT","Big Data Cogn.

The article first outlines how this will inevitably lead to the creation of a parallel crypto-asset market focused on offline wallets and peer-to-peer services outside the supervision of EU and national tax authorities. The article then highlights the important role that the so-called Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) will play in this environment. The differences between CBDCs and crypto-assets are examined from a tax assessment perspective in order to show that true anonymity is considerably less of an issue with (price stable) CBDCs than with (volatile) crypto-assets. The authors argue that a truly anonymous digital euro wallet for small transactions on the consumer side could not only allow the effective monitoring of businesses, but would actually increase tax compliance. If consumers have access to an anonymous cash-equivalent digital means of payment, they will be less likely to use cash or virtual currency. This in turn will cause a significant increase in available transaction data, while simultaneously granting a much better protection of taxpayers' rights to privacy in the EU.","[Jozipovic, Sime] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Split, Croatia; [Jozipovic, Sime] Jean Monnet Chair Business & Finance Law, Split, Croatia; [Jozipovic, Sime] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Jean Monnet Chair Business & Finance Law, Split, Croatia; [Perkusic, Marko] Univ Split, Univ Dept Forens Sci, Split, Croatia; [Perkusic, Marko] Dept Forens, Jean Monnet Chair Business & Finance Law, Split, Croatia; [Gadzo, Stjepan] Univ Rijeka, Fac Law, Rijeka, Croatia","","Jozipovic, S (corresponding author), Univ Split, Fac Econ, Split, Croatia.;Jozipovic, S (corresponding author), Jean Monnet Chair Business & Finance Law, Split, Croatia.","simejozipovic@hotmail.com; maperku@gmail.com; sgadzo@pravri.hr","","","","","","","23","0","0","3","5","KLUWER LAW INT","ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN","ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS","0928-2750","1875-8363","","EC TAX REV","EC Tax Rev.","JAN","2022","31","1","","","","","16","29","","","","","","14","Law","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Government & Law","YY5ZB","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000754866100003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In recent years, with the continuous development of market economy, the continuous improvement of the accounting legal system and accounting standards for enterprises has promoted the research on accounting profit in capital market in China. Due to the restriction of some objective conditions, there are not many valuable research results on the relationship between accounting earnings and stock price changes, and the research methods suitable for the study of accounting earnings still need to be explored and summarized. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has required listed companies to publish quarterly financial and accounting reports since 2002, and the condition of using the regression analysis method to study the accounting profit of listed companies is available. In this context, this paper designs a vector autoregressive model to study the correlation between stock price and accounting profit.

This approach examines the maritime shipping freight response towards the downward and upward movements. The outcomes in this regard show that the major maritime shipping freight rates have multifractals, which tend to increase as the fractal scale also increases. Also, a higher level of multifractality is observed in the downward movements for the Baltic Dry Index, and the Baltic Clean Tanker Index, suggesting that both the indexes have been less efficient, and also unpredictable during the time period pertaining to the pandemic. Moreover, the multifractality is observed to be greater in the upside for the Baltic Dirty Tanker Index during the pandemic, and also in the full-time period. The results also propagate that the maritime shipping freight rates are inefficient, a situation that has been evidently visible during the time period pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic. The maritime shipping freight rates require special attention to monitor such sudden changes in the price dynamics, and following strict regulations is extremely critical in this regard.","[Li, Yajing; Yin, Ming] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, 1550 Haigang Ave, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Yin, Ming] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Shanghai Int Shipping Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Khan, Khalid] Qilu Univ Technol, Sch Finance, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Su, Chi-Wei] Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China","","Yin, M (corresponding author), Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, 1550 Haigang Ave, Shanghai, Peoples R China.","yinm@shmtu.edu.cn","","","National Social Science Fund of China [20BJY177]","National Social Science Fund of China","This work was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (20BJY177)","","37","0","0","11","11","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0308-8839","1464-5254","","MARIT POLICY MANAG","Marit.

This study revolves around published papers and articles related to blockchain technology, relevance analysis and sorting through the retrieved documents with six core layers of blockchain: Application Layer, Contract Layer, Actuator Layer, Consensus Layer, Network Layer and Data Layer. Based on the analysis results, this study found that China's research is more towards the preference and application of landing and industry and smart cities with blockchain as the underlying technology. International research is more focused on the research of finance as the underlying technology of blockchain and tries to combine crypto assets with real industries, such as crypted assets and payment systems for traditional industries. This paper studies the impact of monetary entropy on cryptocurrencies in smart cities and uses the monetary entropy formula to measure the crypto-economic entropy. We use Kolmogorov entropy to describe the degree of chaos in the cryptocurrency market in a smart city. The study illustrates the current status of blockchain technology and applications from the perspective of cryptocurrency in a smart city.

To this aim, we first find the optimal weights of the currencies that can comprise our basket. We then employ volatility spillover decomposition methods to understand which foreign currency mostly drives the others. We then look at how the stability of either stablecoin is affected by currency shocks by means of spillover networks built on VAR models. Our empirical findings show that our basket based stablecoin is less volatile than all single currencies. This result is fundamental for policy making, and especially for emerging markets with a high level of remittances: a Librae (basket based stablecoin) can preserve their value during turbolent times better than a Libra (single currency based stablecoin).","[Giudici, Paolo; Leach, Thomas; Pagnottoni, Paolo] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Pavia, Italy","","Pagnottoni, P (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Pavia, Italy.","paolo.giudici@unipv.it; thomas.leach01@universitadipavia.it; paolo.pagnottoni@unipv.it","Giudici, Paolo/AAA-7773-2021; Pagnottoni, Paolo/AAB-1099-2021","Giudici, Paolo/0000-0002-4198-0127; Pagnottoni, Paolo/0000-0002-0215-4092","European Union's Horizon 2020 training and innovation programme FINTECH [825215, ICT-35-2018]","European Union's Horizon 2020 training and innovation programme FINTECH","The Authors acknowledge useful suggestions and feedback, with Guido Ascari and other colleagues in the Department of economics of the University of Pavia; during the IFABS conference in Medellin and the CEBRA workshop in New York, in which a preliminary version of the methodology contained in this paper was presented.

The mining rig used in this work consists of different graphics processing units (GPUs) and non-LHR (lite hash rate) cards. The UnMineable software has been used for mining dogecoin as well as for wallet integration. The results indicate that mining dogecoin with solar energy as renewable energy consumes 2000 Watts power with overclocking and 1700 Watts power with undervolting technique. This work implicates the potential future of crypto-mining with renewable energy and the hardware configuration associated with it, which is expected to reduce e-waste and improve sustainable development. To reduce the e-waste and high electricity consumption, we have introduced two important techniques named GPU optimization and use of renewable energy for mining, which helps the miners to reduce the e-waste and electricity consumption significantly at the same time getting most out of the GPU by not having any impact on the environment.","[Gundaboina, Lokesh; Badotra, Sumit] Lovely Profess Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Phagwara, Punjab, India; [Bhatia, Tarandeep Kaur] Univ Petr & Energy Studies UPES, Sch Comp Sci, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Sharma, Kulbhushan] Chitkara Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, VLSI Ctr Excellence, Rajpura, Punjab, India; [Mehmood, Gulzar] IQRA Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Swat Campus, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Fayaz, Muhammad] Univ Cent Asia, Dept Comp Sci, Naryn, Kyrgyzstan; [Khan, Inam Ullah] Kings Coll London, Dept Engn, London, England","","Fayaz, M (corresponding author), Univ Cent Asia, Dept Comp Sci, Naryn, Kyrgyzstan.","muhammad.fayaz@ucentralasia.org","Mehmood, Gulzar/ABB-6319-2020","Mehmood, Gulzar/0000-0002-4216-1246","","","","","41","0","0","0","0","WILEY-HINDAWI","LONDON","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND","1939-0114","1939-0122","","SECUR COMMUN NETW","Secur.

Inclusive protocol was proposed to lower the loss of miners who produce stale blocks and increase the blockchain throughput. This paper aims to make an analytical-model-based quantitative comparison of their capabilities against selfish mining attack. Analytical models have been developed for the longest-chain protocol but less to the GHOST protocol. However, the blockchain dynamics and evolution are different when adopting different chain-selection protocols. Therefore, the corresponding analytical models and/or the formulas of calculating metrics (such as miner profitability and system throughput) may be different. To address these challenges, this paper first develops a novel Markov model and the formulas of evaluation metrics, in order to analyze a GHOST-based blockchain system under selfish mining attack. Then extensive experiments are conducted for comparison and we observe that: (i) The GHOST protocol is more resistant to selfish mining attack than the longest-chain protocol from the aspect of relative revenue of selfish miners. (ii) Inclusive protocol can promote the security (evaluated in terms of miner profitability) improvement of the system which has little total computational power or a high forking probability. Additionally, the longest-chain protocol is more sensitive to inclusive protocol than GHOST protocol. (iii) It is hard for each of the two common-used difficulty adjustment algorithms to achieve higher system throughput and security.","[Yang, Runkai; Chang, Xiaolin; Kang, Hongyue] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing Key Lab Secur & Privacy Intelligent Trans, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Misic, Jelena; Misic, Vojislav B.] Ryerson Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada","","Chang, XL (corresponding author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing Key Lab Secur & Privacy Intelligent Trans, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.","18112049@bjtu.edu.cn; xlchang@bjtu.edu.cn; jmisic@scs.ryerson.ca; vmisic@scs.ryerson.ca; 19112051@bjtu.edu.cn","","Kang, Hongyue/0000-0002-9908-347X","Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation [M22037]; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada","Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","The work of Runkai Yang, Xiaolin Chang and Hongyue Kang was supported by Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation (No. M22037).

However, recent security incidents indicate that CAs may (be compromised to) sign fraudulent certificates. In this article, we propose blockchain-based certificate transparency (CT) and revocation transparency (RT) to balance the absolute authority of CAs. Our scheme is compatible with X.509 PKIs but significantly reinforces the security guarantees of a certificate. The CA-signed certificates and their revocation status information of an SSL/TLS web server are published by the subject (i.e., the web server) as a transaction in the global certificate blockchain. The certificate blockchain acts as append-only public logs to monitor CAs' certificate signing and revocation operations, and an SSL/TLS web server is granted with the cooperative control on its certificates. A browser compares the certificate received in SSL/TLS negotiations with the ones in the public certificate blockchain, and accepts it only if it is published and not revoked. We implement the prototype system with Firefox and Nginx, and the experimental results show that it introduces reasonable overheads.","[Wang, Ze; Lin, Jingqiang; Cai, Quanwei; Wang, Qiongxiao; Zha, Daren] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, State Key Lab Informat Secur LOIS, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ze; Lin, Jingqiang; Cai, Quanwei; Wang, Qiongxiao; Zha, Daren] Chinese Acad Sci, Data Assurance & Commun Secur Res Ctr DCS Ctr, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China; [Lin, Jingqiang; Wang, Qiongxiao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Cyber Secur, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Jing, Jiwu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","","Lin, JQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, State Key Lab Informat Secur LOIS, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China.;Lin, JQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Data Assurance & Commun Secur Res Ctr DCS Ctr, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China.","wangze@iie.ac.cn; linjingqiang@iie.ac.cn; caiquanwei@iie.ac.cn; wangqiongxiao@iie.ac.cn; zhadaren@iie.ac.cn; jwjing@ucas.ac.cn","","","Cyber Security Program of National Key RD Plan of China [2017YFB0802100]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61772518]; National 973 Program of China [2014CB340603]","Cyber Security Program of National Key RD Plan of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National 973 Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China)","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their detailed helpful reviews.

Some privacy-conscious token holders want to employ obfuscation methods to protect the origin and destination of their tokens, and the need for token shuffling services (TSS) arose at a historical moment. The prevailing token shuffling policies rely too heavily on blacklists in the token shuffling process, which is contrary to the idea of decentralization. Therefore, weakening or even eliminating the usage of blacklisting mechanisms in TSSs, which is an urgent issue to be addressed. In this paper, we adopt the idea of machine learning and propose a general framework for TSSs, which replaces the natural role under incomplete information with machine learning, so as to achieve the goal of eliminating the blacklist mechanism in TSSs. Then, the token shuffling process is constructed as an extended game under incomplete information on the basis of different token shuffling policies, and this incomplete information game is analyzed on the basis of poison policy, haircut policy, and suicide policy respectively. Finally, the sequential equilibrium under different games is investigated through simulations. The simulation results show that in the incomplete information game based on the poison policy, the participation of two players in the TSS is a sequential equilibrium, while in the incomplete information game based on the haircut policy, the players do not participate in the TSS is an sequential equilibrium.","[Wang, Yilei; Li, Tao] Guizhou Univ, State Key Lab Publ Big Data, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Guiyang, Peoples R China; [Li, Tao; Liu, Ming; Li, Chunmei] Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Rizhao, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hui] Univ Ulsan, Sch Social Sci, Ulsan, South Korea","","Li, T (corresponding author), Guizhou Univ, State Key Lab Publ Big Data, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Guiyang, Peoples R China.","litao_2019@qfnu.edu.cn","","","Foundation of National Natural Science Foundation of China [62072273, 72111530206, 61962009, 62162008]; Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Public Big Data [PBD2021-04]; Foundation of Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Big Data [2019BDKFJJ009]","Foundation of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Public Big Data; Foundation of Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Big Data","This study is supported by the Foundation of National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No: 62072273, 72111530206, 61962009, and 62162008); Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Public Big Data (No. PBD2021-04); Foundation of Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Big Data (No. 2019BDKFJJ009).","","37","0","0","6","6","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0884-8173","1098-111X","","INT J INTELL SYST","Int.

This study provides an introduction to NFTs and explores the 14 largest submarkets using data from the Ethereum blockchain between June 2017 and May 2021. The analyses rely on (a) the number of NFT sales, (b) the dollar volume of NFT trades and (c) the number of unique blockchain wallets that traded NFTs. Based on the number of transactions and wallets, the Ethereumbased NFT market peaked at the end of 2017 due to the success of the CryptoKitties project. As of 2021, fewer transactions occur but the traded value is much higher. We find that NFT submarkets are cointegrated and feature various causal short-run connections between them. The success or adoption of younger NFT projects is influenced by that of more established markets. At the same time, the success of newer markets has an impact on the more established projects. The results contribute to the overall understanding of the NFT phenomenon as an emerging asset class and suggest that NFT markets are immature or even inefficient.","[Ante, Lennart] Blockchain Res Lab, Weidestr 120b, D-22083 Hamburg, Germany","","Ante, L (corresponding author), Blockchain Res Lab, Weidestr 120b, D-22083 Hamburg, Germany.","ante@blockchainresearchlab.org","","","","","","","57","0","0","7","7","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1043-8599","1476-8364","","ECON INNOV NEW TECH","Econ.

The proposed framework meets these privacy requirements by (i) anonymizing both the unique account identifier (NIN) and balance information through customized data generalization and distortion techniques and (ii) making trading transactions unlinkable to their original investors by ensuring that both the NIN and balance are k-anonymous; i.e., k accounts belonging to different investors have the same balance. Moreover, to ensure long-term unlinkability, the process of anonymization is repeated at regular time intervals (every trading session). In addition to anonymity and unlinkability characteristics, the proposed framework is augmented with traceability and non-repudiation features. The simulation experiments with several market sizes and types confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving full k-anonymity. Furthermore, to assess the overhead of the proposed privacy algorithms on the trading execution time, we conduct several experiments considering different anonymity levels k. We compare the transaction execution time of our proposed platform against a traditional non-privacy-preserving blockchain-based stock exchange.

This technology entails a series of transaction lists with identical copies shared and retained by different groups or parties. One field where blockchain technology has tremendous potential is health care, due to the more patient-centric approach to the health care system as well as blockchain's ability to connect disparate systems and increase the accuracy of electronic health records. Objective: The aim of this study was to systematically review studies on the use of blockchain technology in health care and to analyze the characteristics of the studies that have implemented blockchain technology. Methods: This study used a systematic review methodology to find literature related to the implementation aspect of blockchain technology in health care. Relevant papers were searched for using PubMed, SpringerLink, IEEE Xplore, Embase, Scopus, and EBSCOhost. A quality assessment of literature was performed on the 22 selected papers by assessing their trustworthiness and relevance. Results: After full screening, 22 papers were included. A table of evidence was constructed, and the results of the selected papers were interpreted. The results of scoring for measuring the quality of the publications were obtained and interpreted. Out of 22 papers, a total of 3 (14%) high-quality papers, 9 (41%) moderate-quality papers, and 10 (45%) low-quality papers were identified. Conclusions: Blockchain technology was found to be useful in real health care environments, including for the management of electronic medical records, biomedical research and education, remote patient monitoring, pharmaceutical supply chains, health insurance claims, health data analytics, and other potential areas. The main reasons for the implementation of blockchain technology in the health care sector were identified as data integrity, access control, data logging, data versioning, and nonrepudiation. The findings could help the scientific community to understand the implementation aspect of blockchain technology. The results from this study help in recognizing the accessibility and use of blockchain technology in the health care sector.","[Elangovan, Deepa; Bakrin, Faizah Safina; Tan, Ching Siang] KPJ Healthcare Univ Coll, Sch Pharm, Nilai, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia; [Long, Chiau Soon] Quest Int Univ, Fac Comp & Engn, Ipoh, Malaysia; [Goh, Khang Wen] INTI Int Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Nilai 71800, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia; [Yeoh, Siang Fei] Natl Univ Singapore Hosp, Dept Pharm, Singapore, Singapore; [Loy, Mei Jun] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Skudai, Malaysia; [Hussain, Zahid] Univ Canberra, Fac Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Lee, Kah Seng] Univ Cyberjaya, Fac Pharm, Cyberjaya, Malaysia; [Idris, Azam Che] Univ Brunei Darussalam, Fac Integrated Technol, Gadong, Brunei; [Ming, Long Chiau] Univ Brunei Darussalam, Pengiran Anak Puteri Rashidah Saadatul Bolkiah In, Gadong, Brunei","","Goh, KW (corresponding author), INTI Int Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Nilai 71800, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia.","khangwen.goh@newinti.edu.my","Safina, Faizah/GQP-8775-2022; Ming, L C/J-5210-2015","Ming, L C/0000-0002-6971-1383; Ching Siang, Tan/0000-0002-5069-3314; Goh, Khang Wen/0000-0001-6686-7019; Che Idris, Azam/0000-0003-0172-0205","","","","","35","4","4","14","20","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC","TORONTO","130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA","","2291-9694","","JMIR MED INF","JMIR Med.

All these can be achieved by a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) backbone. As a mathematical model for enabling this DLT backbone, IOTA's Tangle is gaining popularity due to its scalability and freedom from transaction fees. Unlike blockchain, the Tangle uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, and its design does not cover essential blockchain pitfalls, including expensive Proof of Work (PoW), limited throughput, high transaction costs, and significant confirmation delays. The original IOTA is evolving into a Coordinator-less environment, the Coordicide. It requires additional modules, such as auto-peering and a reputation system, to fully exploit Tangle's scalability and complete decentralization potential. Nevertheless, each new evolutionary update adds complexity and may introduce security threats. Therefore, the present survey's motivation is a detailed security analysis of the IOTA. To spur developers and researchers' interest and summarize the security status in IOTA, we have drawn the current review. Our survey outlines security vulnerabilities on IOTA and their mitigation strategies and explores several important open directions to be researched further. The vulnerabilities are discussed on both the original IOTA and its upcoming Coordicide version. In summary, this survey is first in the field for (i) understanding the basic functionalities of the IOTA, (ii) listing the security solutions provided in the literature against the reported and unreported attacks, and (iii) presenting open research questions (RQ) for directing the future investigations on IOTA.","[Conti, Mauro; Kumar, Gulshan; Saha, Rahul] Univ Padua, Dept Math, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Kumar, Gulshan; Saha, Rahul] Lovely Profess Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Phagwara, Punjab, India; [Nerurkar, Pranav] NMIMS Univ, Mukesh Patel Sch Technol Management & Engn, Dept Data Sci, Mumbai, India; [Vigneri, Luigi] IOTA Fdn, Res Dept, Berlin, Germany","","Kumar, G (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Math, I-35131 Padua, Italy.","gulshan3971@gmail.com","Conti, Mauro/F-9145-2012","Conti, Mauro/0000-0002-3612-1934","","","","","100","2","2","2","2","ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","LONDON","24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND","1084-8045","1095-8592","","J NETW COMPUT APPL","J.

(b) The firms operating across different sectors respond disproportionally to the cryptocurrency market. For instance, the sectors that offer low returns in Africa (industrial, energy, financial) negatively respond to the cryptocurrency market, while the sectors that offer high returns (real estate and information technology) are not significantly affected.

Our model analyzes the optimal payment choice for consumers under various macroeconomic conditions. We determine that an individual economic agent chooses payment methods under specific conditions by incorporating policy interest rates on CBDCs and stablecoins used on cryptocurrency exchanges. We analyze the impacts of CBDCs and stablecoins on the choice of whether to use cash or deposits. We also examine how the agent changes her portfolio compositions in response to exogenous macroeconomic policies. If a government replaces cash with a CBDC, the convenience of digital currency would not affect consumer choices. The higher the government's interest rate on CBDCs, the more consumers will use CBDCs than deposits.","[Son, Jaemin] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Coll Confucian Studies & Eastern Philosophy, Seoul, South Korea; [Bilgin, Mehmet Huseyin] Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ryu, Doojin] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 03063, South Korea","","Ryu, D (corresponding author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 03063, South Korea.","sharpjin@skku.edu","","Ryu, Doojin/0000-0002-0059-4887","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2022R1A2C1010596]","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2022R1A2C1010596).","","57","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","2199-4730","","FINANC INNOV","Financ.

The authors compare and contrast blockchains with existing legacy systems. The authors identify existing regulation, accounting standards, guidelines and potential amendments in under-explored areas such as taxation, accounting treatment of crypto-assets/liabilities and detailed auditing procedures. The study aims to highlight the trends, differences and gaps between academic and industry literature. The authors provide a behavioral, social, cultural, organizational, regulatory, ethical, accountability and managerial perspectives of blockchain adoption in accounting. Finally, the study develops two adoption frameworks. Design/methodology/approach The authors' study follows (Moher et al., 2009) and (Briner and Denyer, 2012) methodology to conduct the systematic review and the steps are mentioned below. The authors construct a final sample of 452 from a preliminary search of three multi-disciplinary databases from 2012 to 2020. First, the authors motivate the review and formulate the research questions. Second, the authors aggregate relevant literature from both industry and academia and implement quality assessments. Third, the authors analyze the literature and construct the final sample of articles. Fourth, the authors conducted textual analysis, keyword frequencies and identify gaps, trends and similarities between academic and industry literature and develop the authors' frameworks Findings The authors identify 3 (ABDC, B and A* ranked) journals as publishing top article numbers with the highest article count for 2017 with 96 articles in academia and 2019 for the industry with 21 articles. Second-highest publications for academia occur in 2018 with 77 followed by, whereas in the industry, publications occur in the year 2016 with 16 articles. Two co-authors appear most popular with 103 articles. Word clouds, a mind map and article theme counts are used to identify nine key research clusters: data management, financial applications, sustainability, accounting and auditing, business and industrial, education, governance, privacy/security and disruptive technology. Research limitations/implications Systematic reviews can have selection biases mainly due to search and selection criteria distortions when constructing the final sample of articles. The authors address selection bias by refining our search keyword combinations by using different permutations and using keywords from articles already collected. The authors employ three databases and review the reference list of articles collected to add more articles that may have been missed into our sample. In addition, to avoid inconsistent coding of domains/themes and interpretations, the authors carefully review our domain identifications and all our analysis twice independently using two research assistants to obtain the same conclusions. Practical implications The authors' unique contributions include reviewing additional papers, differentiating between industry, academic articles, common trends and gaps in much scattered prior literature. The authors identify existing accounting standards, guidelines, limitations and possible amendments required in future for blockchain adoption in accounting in taxation, accounting treatment of crypto-assets/liabilities and detailed audit procedures. Blockchains are compared with legacy accounting technologies and two frameworks for adoption developed. The authors' results could impact the understanding of existing regulation, accounting standards, future amendments, areas requiring clarity and future collaborative research between academia and industry across multi-disciplines. Practical implications to academics, professional bodies, regulators and industry practitioners exist. Social implications The authors' study identifies significant implications on organizations, environment, culture and society in general. The authors identify that social engagement projects may be easily initiated and implemented with decentralized accounting information systems. Transparency and efficiency would change organization culture, ways accountants and even employees interact with each other and community. Anonymity in blockchains can be used for criminal activities. Coding of negative social dynamics to smart contracts may persist. Transparency of personally identifiable information may place individuals at risk. Regulation and standards would need to identify equity, ethics in blockchains which notwithstanding energy consumption, and could enable environmental protection increasing societal sustainability. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that compares academic and industry literature of 452 articles to identify gaps and similarities from 2012 to 2020 using three multi-disciplinary databases. The authors' study is the first study to in detail existing accounting standards, unclear areas, future amendments for International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) standards on taxation, financial reporting and all aspects of auditing procedures. The authors further categorize prior literature into these key areas and develop two frameworks (DAERPS and DAIS) that are linked to our review results and prior literature. The authors identify the impact of blockchain adoption on key stakeholders, regulation, society, culture, organization, accountability and ethics.","[Jayasuriya, D.

Even though their currency characteristics have been challenged by several researchers, they constitute an important speculative financial asset. This paper examines the long memory properties in high frequency (5 min) time series of eight important cryptocurrencies. We perform a statistical analysis of two key financial characteristics of time series: return and volatility. We compute information theory quantifiers using a wavelet decomposition of the time series: wavelet entropy and wavelet statistical complexity of returns and volatility of each time series. We find two important features in the time series: (i) high frequency returns exhibit a trend toward a more efficient behavior, and (ii) high frequency volatility reflects a strong persistence in volatility. Both findings have important implications for portfolio managers, and investors in general. The presence of persistent volatility validates the use of GARCH-type models. Thus, understanding volatility could create opportunities for short-term day traders.","[Vampa, Victoria; Calderon, Lucila] Univ Nacl La Plata, Fac Ingn, La Plata, Argentina; [Martin, Maria T.; Calderon, Lucila] Univ Nacl La Plata, Fac Ciencias Exactas, La Plata, Argentina; [Bariviera, Aurelio F.] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Business, Av Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain","","Bariviera, AF (corresponding author), Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Business, Av Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain.","aurelio.fernandez@urv.cat","Bariviera, Aurelio F./J-5698-2013","Bariviera, Aurelio F./0000-0003-1014-1010","","","","","30","0","0","1","1","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","2367-3370","2367-3389","978-3-030-94485-8; 978-3-030-94484-1","LECT NOTE NETW SYST","","","2022","384","","","","","","25","35","","10.1007/978-3-030-94485-8_2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-94485-8_2","","","11","Business, Finance; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics; Computer Science","BT0FA","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000787129900002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

These records are of different priorities and business requirements. From our comprehensive literature review, we observe that the existing models have no provision of prioritizing the EMR transactions. This critically affects the quick and streamline sharing of emergency EMRs in a smart healthcare environment. Furthermore, the lack of prioritization significantly restricts the optimal usage of the blockchain network. Motivated by this, we first propose a lightweight and deterministic method to prioritize the flow of emergency healthcare transactions through the smart contract. We also propose logical stateless transaction models for different entities involved in the system with varying levels of trust. Finally, the performance of the model based on the private Ethereum is verified and it outperforms the existing benchmark model in terms of usefulness in the healthcare setting and computation overhead with the use of a simple prioritizing algorithm.

This study aims to investigate the contribution of the coronavirus pandemic to the creation of market bubbles. Design/methodology/approach This study identifies four major cryptocurrency market bubbles by using the Phillips et al. (2016) (hereafter PSY) test. Subsequently, the co-movements of the coronavirus proxies with PSY measurement using the wavelet approach were studied. Findings Short-lived bubbles are detected at the beginning of the studied period, and more extended bubble periods are identified at the end. Besides, the empirical results show evidence of significant negative co-movement between each pandemic proxy and each cryptocurrency bubble measurement. Research limitations/implications Given the complex financial dynamics of the cryptocurrency markets due to some behavioral biases in some circumstances, investors can benefit from the date stamping of the bubbles bursting to make the best trading positions. In the same way, governments could support the healthy development of cryptocurrencies by preventing bubbles during such pandemics. Originality/value The financial bubble is commonly attributed to a change in investor behavior. Because traders and investors think they can resell the asset at a higher price in the future. This study explored the contribution of the COVID-19 pandemic in the creation of these bubbles by date stamping their occurrence and explosive periods.

The results provide evidence of pronounced herding during the bull phase, extreme down-markets, and high volatility.

Moreover, when addressing asset pricing, portfolio selection, and investment strategies, accurate estimates of the relationship among assets are as necessary as are delicate in a time-dependent context. In this regard, fundamental tools that increasingly attract research interests are precision matrix and graphical models, which are able to obtain insights into the joint evolution of financial quantities. In this paper, we present a robust divergence estimator for a time-varying precision matrix that can manage both the extreme events and time-dependency that affect financial time series. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm to handle parameter estimations that uses the maximization-minimization approach. We apply the methodology to synthetic data to test its performances. Then, we consider the cryptocurrency market as a real data application, given its remarkable suitability for the proposed method because of its volatile and unregulated nature.","[Stolfi, Paola; Vergni, Davide] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Appl Math Mauro Picone IAC, Via Taurini 19, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Bernardi, Mauro] Univ Padua, Dept Stat Sci, Via C Battisti 241, I-35121 Padua, Italy","","Stolfi, P (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Appl Math Mauro Picone IAC, Via Taurini 19, I-00185 Rome, Italy.","p.stolfi@iac.cnr.it","","Stolfi, Paola/0000-0003-3688-5464","","","","","47","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","2199-4730","","FINANC INNOV","Financ.

The findings of the study show that news sentiment has a significant impact on cryptocurrency returns. When the investors' sentiment is optimistic or bullish, the cryptocurrency market experiences herding behaviour, leading to an increase in prices. The diverse and heterogeneous nature of the various cryptocurrencies causes each individual cryptocurrency to respond differently to sentiment. Further, we see that sentiment has a more pronounced impact on young, small, and volatile cryptocurrencies.

To emphasize the decentralized nature of fiat currency, we can refer, for example, to the fact that all virtual currency users may access services without third-party involvement. Cryptocurrency price swings are non-stationary and highly erratic, similarly to the price changes of conventional stocks. Owing to the appeal of cryptocurrencies, both investors and researchers have paid more attention to cryptocurrency price forecasts. With the rise of deep learning, cryptocurrency forecasting has gained great importance. In this study, we present a long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm that can be used to forecast the values of four types of cryptocurrencies: AMP, Ethereum, Electro-Optical System, and XRP. Mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and normalize root mean square error (NRMSE) analyses were used to evaluate the LSTM model. The findings obtained from these models showed that the LSTM algorithm had superior performance in predicting all forms of cryptocurrencies. Thus, it can be regarded as the most effective algorithm. The LSTM model provided promising and accurate forecasts for all cryptocurrencies. The model was applied to forecast the future closing prices of cryptocurrencies over a period of 180 days. The Pearson correlation metric was applied to assess the correlation between the prediction and target values in the training and testing processes. The LSTM algorithm achieved the highest correlation values in training (R = 96.73%) and in testing (96.09%) in predicting XRP currency prices. Cryptocurrency prices could be accurately predicted using the established LSTM model, which displayed highly efficient performance. The relevance of applying these models is that they may have huge repercussions for the economy by assisting investors and traders in identifying trends in the sales and purchases of different types of cryptocurrencies. The results of the LSTM model were compared with those of existing systems. The results of this study demonstrate that the proposed model showed superior accuracy based on the low prediction errors of the proposed system.","[Ammer, Mohammed Abdullah; Aldhyani, Theyazn H.

In addition, multifractality in the energy markets is sensitive to trends, time horizon and major events. More importantly, the results suggest superior efficiency of clean-energy markets compared to conventional energies. We confirm the time-varying nature of market efficiency in the energy markets, and during the recent COVID-19 outbreak, market inefficiencies in the clean and dirty energy markets soared.

The research finds that e-CNY will have significant impact on monetary policy: (1) E-CNY will change the structure of money demand, speed up currency circulation, make central bank reserves more controllable and money supply more intelligent; (2) E-CNY will increase the volatility and expansion effect of currency multiplier to a certain extent; (3) E-CNY will dredge the transmission channel of monetary policy so as to improve the transmission effect of existing monetary policy tools. At the same time, based on the organic combination with structural monetary policy tools, it will achieve precise implementation of medium-term lending facilities (MLF), pledged supplementary lending (PSL), and it may bring new monetary policy tools. (4) E-CNY will make the intermediate target of monetary policy more controllable and reliable, and have a positive impact on the target of monetary policy through the smooth transmission of monetary policy channels. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the research on CBDC, give full play to the positive role of e-CNY in monetary policy, and improve the effectiveness of monetary policy.","[Yang, Jiemeng; Zhou, Guangyou] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China","","Zhou, GY (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.","zgy@fudan.edu.cn","","Luo, Sumei/0000-0001-6400-8093","Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China [21ZD117]","Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China","This paper is supported by the Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21&ZD117).

That greatly expands the application domain of Blockchain 2.0 while importing much more security issues than Blockchain 1.0. Intensive research on the security of blockchain technology has been conducted, showing that security has become the most concerned topic in the blockchain realm, and consensus and smart contracts are the most vulnerable parts to be attacked. On account of this, we are concerned mainly in this review paper with security issues related to consensus and smart contracts. Different from previous surveys, this survey especially tries to provide a systematic and comprehensive view on the security of blockchain technology within consensus and smart contracts through the integral action-pathway from root causes, vulnerabilities, and attacks, to the consequences. Moreover, the proposed countermeasures to the security issues in consensus and smart contracts are also evaluated and discussed in a holistic manner. With our understanding of the surveyed methods, we believe that countermeasures should be proposed with full consideration of the causal relationships among causes, vulnerabilities, attacks, and consequences. We expect the current work can pave the way for a comprehensive understanding of how a security issue functions and where the undiscovered vulnerabilities and possible attacks hide, so as to systematically design the countermeasures.","[Cao, Xuelian; Zhang, Jianhui; Wu, Xuechen; Liu, Bo] Southwest Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, RISE, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China","","Liu, B (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, RISE, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.","xuelian7@email.swu.edu.cn; luvu.zhang@gmail.com; wxc227@email.swu.edu.cn; liubocq@swu.edu.cn","","Liu, Bo/0000-0002-9026-2543","Special Foundation for Basic Science and Frontier Technology Research Program of Chongqing [cstc2017jcyjAX0295]; Capacity Development Foundation of Southwest University [SWU116007]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61732019, 62032019, 61872051]","Special Foundation for Basic Science and Frontier Technology Research Program of Chongqing; Capacity Development Foundation of Southwest University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","Project is supported in part by the Special Foundation for Basic Science and Frontier Technology Research Program of Chongqing (No. cstc2017jcyjAX0295), the Capacity Development Foundation of Southwest University (No. SWU116007), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.61732019, 62032019, 61872051).","","161","0","0","15","23","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1936-6442","1936-6450","","PEER PEER NETW APPL","Peer Peer Netw.

Continuous digital transformation has recently become a feature sine qua non for companies. It is also stimulating business model innovation resulting in the growing adoption of ecosystem-based models. These trends may have significant implications for the principal-agent relationship, essential for understanding value creation by a firm. In order to analyze the impact of digital transformation, we use blockchain technology as a proxy. To measure the potential impact on the principal-agent conflict, we study management and shareholder-sponsored proposals at annual meetings. The level of shareholder involvement in governance is measured based on the number of shareholder-sponsored proposals received. In addition, we measure shareholder support for management-sponsored proposals. A sample of 2481 NYSE, Nasdaq and AMEX-traded firms for the period 2015-2019 is used. First of all, we show that digitalization per se has a mitigating impact on the agency conflict. Shareholders become more active, albeit not more hostile towards management. Secondly, we have identified the strongest impact in such sectors as information technology, communications, finance, and healthcare. These are the most significantly impacted by ecosystem-based business model innovation. We conclude that digitalization and ecosystem-based business models are mutually reinforcing in mitigating the principal-agent conflict.","[Ivaninskiy, Ilya; Ivashkovskaya, Irina] HSE Univ, Sch Finance, Moscow, Russia","","Ivaninskiy, I (corresponding author), HSE Univ, Sch Finance, Moscow, Russia.","iivaninskiy@hse.ru; iivashkovskaya@hse.ru","","","","","","","51","0","0","12","12","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","1309-4297","2147-4281","","EURASIAN BUS REV","Eurasian Bus.

Based on these two methods, we construct networks by applying the minimum spanning tree and the planar maximally filtered graph. Furthermore, we study the statistical and topological properties of these networks. Numerical results demonstrate that the degree distribution follows the power-law and the graphs after the COVID-19 outbreak have noticeable differences in network measurements compared to before. Moreover, the results of graphs constructed by each method are different in topological and statistical properties and the network's behavior. In particular, during the post-COVID-19 period, it can be seen that Ethereum and Qtum are the most influential cryptocurrencies in both methods.

The preliminary statistical study reveals (i) high volatility, (ii) an inverse leverage effect, (iii) skewed distributions and (iv) high kurtosis. To capture the nonnormal characteristics observed in cryptocurrency data, we verified the goodness of fit of a large set of distributions, both symmetric and skewed distributions such as skewed Student-t, skewed generalized t, skewed generalized error and the inverse hyperbolic sign distributions. The results show that the skewed distributions outperform normal and Student-t distributions in fitting cryptocurrency data, although there is no one skewed distribution that systematically better fits the data. In addition, we compare these distributions in terms of their ability to forecast the market risk of cryptocurrencies. In line with the results obtained in the statistical analysis, we find that the skewed distributions provide better risk estimates than the normal and Student-t distributions, both in short and long positions, with SGED being the distribution that provides better results.","[Lopez-Martin, Carmen; Arguedas-Sanz, Raquel] Natl Distance Educ Univ UNED, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Business & Accounting, Senda Rey 11, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Benito Muela, Sonia] Natl Distance Educ Univ UNED, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ Anal, Senda Rey 11, Madrid 28040, Spain","","Lopez-Martin, C (corresponding author), Natl Distance Educ Univ UNED, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Business & Accounting, Senda Rey 11, Madrid 28040, Spain.","carmen.lopez@cee.uned.es; rarguedas@cee.uned.es; soniabm@cee.uned.es","López-Martín, Carmen/R-3402-2018; SANZ, RAQUEL ARGUEDAS/O-1479-2016","López-Martín, Carmen/0000-0001-6520-4950; SANZ, RAQUEL ARGUEDAS/0000-0001-7368-6347","Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [PID2020-113367RB-I00]","Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government)","This work has been funded by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (PID2020-113367RB-I00).","","72","0","0","8","8","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1059-0560","1873-8036","","INT REV ECON FINANC","Int.

The difficulties are even more exacerbated when examining the uses of DLT for achieving more sustainable buildings. In this context, this article conducts a comprehensive literature review on blockchain, the most discussed DLT technology nowadays, for sustainability, focusing on extending key applications discussed in various fields to the construction industry and real estate. The novelty of this review paper is the presentation of an in-depth discussion of what the next steps in blockchain research should be in order to integrate its applications for achieving a sustainable construction environment with cleaner production and resource use efficiency. A conceptual framework is also proposed to showcase the integration of blockchain with other applications for facilitating the goal of achieving sustainable buildings, including Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA).","[Figueiredo, Karoline; Haddad, Assed] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, UFRJ, Programa Engn Ambiental, BR-21941901 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Hammad, Ahmed W.

Accommodative monetary policies have also brought interest rates down to zero and/or negative territory as a mean to stimulate business investments. The recent rise of cryptocurrencies (The terms cryptocurrencies and crypto assets are used interchangeably.) poses, in turn, urgent challenges to central banks' efforts to face the multiple pandemic-driven unprecedented consequences. Private currencies may lead to a relatively cashless society, thereby threatening central bank monopoly of issuance, a situation in which businesses, households and financial markets could lose access to risk-free central bank money. In addition, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) promises to transform the traditional financial system into an open, permission-less and autonomous financial system. The present paper discusses the rise of digital payments across the euro area, the spread of cryptocurrency trading and the intention of the European Central Bank (ECB) to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC). We provide evidence on the existence of cointegration between selected cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and traditional financial assets. Both the rise of digital payments and the increased popularity of cryptocurrencies can be seen as the main drivers behind the prospective issuance of the digital euro, significantly affecting financial markets and business models alike.","[Pelagidis, Theodore; Kostika, Eleftheria] Bank Greece, 21 El Venizelou, Athens 10250, Greece; [Pelagidis, Theodore] Univ Piraeus, Dept Maritime Studies, Econ, Piraeus, Greece","","Kostika, E (corresponding author), Bank Greece, 21 El Venizelou, Athens 10250, Greece.","pelagidi@unipi.gr; ekostika@bankofgreece.gr","","","","","","","85","1","1","1","1","SPRINGERNATURE","LONDON","CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND","0391-2078","1972-4977","","J IND BUS ECON","J.

With the different capabilities of the technology, such as immutability of information and decentralisation of authority attributes, the built environment is slow in its adoption. This study aims to explore the barriers to the implementation of blockchain technology in the construction using a principal component analysis (PCA) approach. Design/methodology/approach This research took a post-positivist philosophical stance, which informed a quantitative research approach through a questionnaire survey. From the South African built environment and information technology sector, 79 respondents were drawn through a snowballing sampling technique. The built environment professionals include architect, construction project manager, construction manager, quantity surveyor and engineer. Retrieved data were screened and analysed by adopting the descriptive analysis and PCA while Cronbach alpha evaluated the reliability. Also, Kruskal-Wallis H non-parametric test was used to determine the differences in the opinion of the respondent groups. Findings The analysis revealed that all the identified barriers ranked above the average mean with lack of clarity, scalability risks and lack of skills or knowledge ranking top three. PCA clustered the identified barriers into three components: organisational barriers, social barriers and technological barriers. Research limitations/implications This study was carried out in the Gauteng province of South Africa, leaving out other provinces due to accessibility, cost and time constraints. Practical implications Built environment organisations need to be kept abreast of the capabilities of blockchain technology as the major barrier observed was the lack of clarity of blockchain technology. Also, the technological barriers identified from this study need to be addressed by information technology experts to give consumers the desired value for money in implementing blockchain technology for the built environment. Originality/value The blockchain technology capabilities are incomparable to any other invention thus far. Therefore, it is very important that the numerous stakeholders in the built environment be made aware of the blockchain technology capabilities while formulating a solution to the identified barriers. This will aid its implementation in the built environment and help the industry measure up with its counterparts.","[Akinradewo, Opeoluwa Israel; Aigbavboa, Clinton Ohis; Oke, Ayodeji Emmanuel] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Cidb Ctr Excellence, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Edwards, David John] Birmingham City Univ, Dept Built Environm, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Edwards, David John] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Johannesburg, South Africa","","Akinradewo, OI (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Cidb Ctr Excellence, Johannesburg, South Africa.","opeakinradewo@gmail.com","Oke, Ayodeji Emmanuel/C-1218-2013","Oke, Ayodeji Emmanuel/0000-0001-6551-8634; Edwards, David/0000-0001-9727-6000","Global Excellence Stature 4.0 PhD Bursary, School of Postgraduate Studies, University of Johannesburg","Global Excellence Stature 4.0 PhD Bursary, School of Postgraduate Studies, University of Johannesburg","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by Global Excellence Stature 4.0 PhD Bursary, School of Postgraduate Studies, University of Johannesburg to fund this research.","","102","1","1","7","7","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1726-0531","","","J ENG DES TECHNOL","J.

Thus, the current work explores the intentions of e-retailers in the Asia and Pacific region to adopt cryptocurrencies. This study considers the TAM-based SOR, with a combination of non-cognitive attributes (compatibility and convenience) proposed as stimuli for e-retailers to adopt the examined cryptocurrencies. The findings indicate that the proposed non-cognitive attributes are critical in determining e-retailers' technostress (emotional state). Moreover, it was found that technostress among e-retailers profoundly impacts their intentions to adopt cryptocurrency in business settings. Meanwhile, regulatory support communication can be used to help regulatory bodies and governing institutions control the future economy worldwide. The proposed study offers significant theoretical and practical contributions through its investigation of e-retailers' intentions to adopt cryptocurrency for the first time in the particular context of technostress and regulatory support.","[Wu, Runhan] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Ishfaq, Kamran; Hussain, Siraj] Bahauddin Zakariya Univ, Dept Sociol, Multan 60800, Pakistan; [Asmi, Fahad] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Sci & Technol Commun, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China; [Siddiquei, Ahmad Nabeel] Bond Univ, Bond Business Sch, Gold Coast 4226, Australia; [Anwar, Muhammad Azfar] Shenzhen Univ, Res Inst Business Analyt & Supply Chain Managemen, Coll Management, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China","","Hussain, S (corresponding author), Bahauddin Zakariya Univ, Dept Sociol, Multan 60800, Pakistan.;Asmi, F (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Sci & Technol Commun, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China.","runhanwu@mail.ecust.edu.cn; dr.kamran@bzu.edu.pk; siraj.raza@bzu.edu.pk; fasmie@ustc.edu.cn; asiddiqu@bond.edu.au; azfar@szu.edu.cn","Asmi, Fahad/B-3024-2018","Asmi, Fahad/0000-0002-3260-4277; Siddiquei, Ahmad/0000-0002-1209-5401; Hussain, Siraj/0000-0003-1508-9821","","","","","107","4","4","6","13","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2071-1050","","SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL","Sustainability","JAN","2022","14","2","","","","","","","641","10.3390/su14020641","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14020641","","","21","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","YN4AT","","Green Published, gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000747202700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

As a result, market conditions, whether good or bad, become imperative to assess the benefits of safe have, hedges or diversification. Also, the presence of uncertainties in markets may have asymmetrical effects which make it necessary to assess their impact over time. The emergence of COVID-19 pandemic as a global uncertainty has altered the dynamics of most financial markets. Consequently, this may influence the lead/lag relationships in most financial time series at various frequencies to contribute to the heterogeneous nature of market participants. Hence, the study examines the interdependencies between cryptocurrencies, selected stocks markets of Africa, and Gold returns in a time-frequency domain before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a day-to-day observations, from August 8th, 2015 to May 5th, 2020, we assess the benefits of portfolio diversification, hedges, and safe haven with the bi-wavelet technique. The findings reveal that gold and cryptocurrencies provide a safe haven, diversification and, hedge for investors of African stock especially in the Ghanaian stock market (short-term) and also during this COVID-19 period. These findings contribute to the literature on financial market interdependencies, asymmetries to demonstrate financial market participants' diverse investment horizons.

For instance, we will ask whether regulation strengthening may incite a category of investors to flight to unregulated and non-compliant decentralised exchange platforms to stay under the radar of regulators. Furthermore, we ask whether regulation may lead to a two-tier industry, fragmented between compliant trading venues that attract mainstream users and non-compliant trading venues that attract privacy-centric users. We argue that somewhat paradoxically, regulation may push part of the crypto-industry to the 'dark side' of financial innovation and drives privacy-centric investors out of the scope of regulators.","[Sauce, Loic] ISTEC Business Sch, 128 Quai Jemmapes, F-75010 Paris, France","","Sauce, L (corresponding author), ISTEC Business Sch, 128 Quai Jemmapes, F-75010 Paris, France.","l.sauce@istec.fr","","","","","","","79","0","0","4","4","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0309-166X","1464-3545","","CAMB J ECON","Cambr.

Design/methodology/approach First, the authors estimate the hedging and safe haven abilities of gold, cryptocurrency and commodities for the Indian stock market and further verify whether such properties vary across the broad stock market indices and over the different degrees of market volatility. Second, the authors use the multivariate GARCH framework to calculate the dynamic hedge ratios and hedging efficiencies to compare the hedging properties of the alternative asset classes. Third, the authors verify the robustness of the general findings during the recent crisis emanating from the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings Gold, cryptocurrency and most commodities have significant hedging abilities. Only natural gas, crude oil and aluminum, on the other hand, have safe haven property. Neither gold nor cryptocurrency qualifies as a safe haven asset. On the other hand, the financialization of the Indian commodities market provides a significant dividend to investors in terms of hedging and safe haven capabilities. The authors find the least negative hedge ratio and the highest positive hedging effectiveness for the stock-crude oil and stock-natural gas portfolios. The central observations of the paper remain immune to the COVID crisis. Originality/value Focusing on the Indian equity market, the paper compares the diversification abilities of traditional assets like gold with those of the modern class of assets, including cryptocurrency and other commodities.","[Majumder, Sayantan Bandhu] St Xaviers Univ, Dept Econ, Kolkata, India","","Majumder, SB (corresponding author), St Xaviers Univ, Dept Econ, Kolkata, India.","sayantanm.eco@gmail.com","","BANDHU MAJUMDER, SAYANTAN/0000-0003-0787-8265","","","","","54","0","0","2","4","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1753-8254","1753-8262","","INDIAN GROWTH DEV RE","Indian Growth Dev.

In this paper, we study whether investors' informed trading behavior can significantly predict cryptocurrency returns. We use various machine learning algorithms to verify the contribution of informed trading to the predictability of cryptocurrency returns. The results show that informed trading plays a role in the prediction of some individual cryptocurrency returns, but it cannot significantly improve the prediction accuracy in an average sense of the whole market.

Design/methodology/approach As they allow to trace transitional shifts over time and across different frequency bands, this paper relies on continuous wavelet tools to investigate the time-frequency comovement among wheat and global stock markets. Findings The results show an increase in wheat futures prices at all maturities and a weak integration level within each wheat market during the subprime crisis. Moreover, the wavelet power spectra maps show high wheat and equity price volatility at different time scales and for various subperiods. Furthermore, the continuous wavelet coherence highlights time-frequency-varying comovements between the markets considered, which become particularly high during times of crisis. Practical implications The results provide market participants with a better understanding of the nature as well as the magnitude of the relationship between the global financial market and different wheat markets at different maturities and during tranquil and crisis periods. Indeed, from investors' perspective it is important to understand how markets are segmented or integrated during tranquil and crisis periods in order to better assess risks, diversify portfolios and implement more effective hedging strategies. As for regulators, a better understanding of the level of integration of different markets would further help refine macroprudential policies, and thus strengthen financial stability and resilience. Originality/value This paper enriches the existing literature by investigating the time-frequency comovement between wheat and a global equity market. Indeed, the dynamics between stock and wheat markets across different nearest to maturities have not been widely explored by previous studies.","[Ben Amar, Amine; Bouattour, Mondher] Excelia Business Sch, Dept Finance, La Rochelle, France; [Carlotti, Jean-Etienne] Paris Saclay Univ, Dept Econ, Paris, France","","Ben Amar, A (corresponding author), Excelia Business Sch, Dept Finance, La Rochelle, France.","benamara@excelia-group.com","Ben Amar, Amine/AFP-9500-2022","Ben Amar, Amine/0000-0002-5234-6420","","","","","28","0","0","1","1","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1526-5943","2331-2947","","J RISK FINANC","J.

This study confirms the existence of spillover effects employing Diebold and Yilmaz's (2012) methodology. The results show that USA and China are net shock transmitter of TPU, while Japan is a net receiver. Chinese TPU has the largest influence among the three countries followed by USA and Japan. This study also employs vector autoregression (VAR)-DCC-GARCH and VAR-ADCC-GARCH to capture the spillover effects on stock returns and volatility. We find that TPU of USA, China, and Japan transmits shocks that drive stock market returns of fragile economies. However, the sign of the spillover effects is country specific and depends on a country's TPU. Similar evidence was found for volatility spillover. In few cases, TPU of USA, China, and Japan stabilizes the stock market returns volatility.

First, to measure the effect of the COVID-19 on the volatility connectedness among global stock sectors in the time-frequency domain, we combine the time-varying connectedness and frequency connectedness method and focus on the total, directional, and net connectedness. The empirical results indicate a dramatic rise in the total connectedness among the global stock sectors following the outbreak of COVID-19. However, the high level of the total connectedness lasted only about two months, representing that the impact of COVID-19 is significant but not durable. Furthermore, we observe that the directional and net connectedness changes of different stock sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic are heterogeneous, and the diverse possible driving factors. In addition, the transmission of spillovers among sectors is driven mainly by the highfrequency component (short-term spillovers) during the full sample time. However, the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak also persisted in the long term. Second, we explore how the changing COVID-19 pandemic intensity (represented by the daily new COVID-19 confirmed cases and the daily new COVID-19 death cases worldwide) affect the daily returns of the global stock sectors by using the Quantile-on-Quantile Regression (QQR) methodology of Sim and Zhou (2015). The results indicate the different characteristics in responses of the stock sectors to the pandemic intensity. Specifically, most sectors are severely impacted by the COVID-19. In contrast, some sectors (Necessary Consume and Medical & Health) that are least affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (especially in the milder stage of the COVID-19 pandemic) are those that are related to the provision of goods and services which can be considered as necessities and substitutes. These results also hold after several robustness checks. Our findings may help understand the sectoral dynamics in the global stock market and provide significant implications for portfolio managers, investors, and government agencies in times of highly stressful events like the COVID19 crisis.","[Dong, Zibing] Northeastern Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Li, Yanshuang] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Appl Finance & Behav Sci, 217Jian Shan St, Dalian 116025, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Zhuang, Xintian; Wang, Jian] Northeastern Univ, Sch Business Adm, 195 Innovat Rd, Shenyang 110169, Liaoning, Peoples R China","","Li, YS (corresponding author), Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Appl Finance & Behav Sci, 217Jian Shan St, Dalian 116025, Liaoning, Peoples R China.","zibingdong0501@163.com; yanshuangli668@163.com; xtzhuang@mail.neu.edu.cn; jwang@mail.neu.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71571038, 71671030,71971048]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","Acknowledgement This paper was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71571038, 71671030,71971048)","","64","0","0","6","6","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1062-9408","1879-0860","","N AM J ECON FINANC","N.

It is therefore important to summarise existing research papers and results on cryptocurrency trading, including available trading platforms, trading signals, trading strategy research and risk management. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of cryptocurrency trading research, by covering 146 research papers on various aspects of cryptocurrency trading (e.g., cryptocurrency trading systems, bubble and extreme condition, prediction of volatility and return, crypto-assets portfolio construction and crypto-assets, technical trading and others).

We show that both indices spiked during news related to new developments in CBDC and in relation to digital currency news items. We demonstrate that CBDC indices have a significant negative relationship with the volatilities of the MSCI World Banks Index, USEPU, and the FTSE AllWorld Index, and positive with the volatilities of cryptocurrency markets, foreign exchange markets, bond markets, VIX, and gold. Our results suggest that financial markets are more sensitive to CBDC Uncertainty than CBDC Attention as proxy by these indices. These findings contain useful insights to individual and institutional investors, and can guide policymakers, regulators, and the media on how CBDC evolved as a barometer in the new digital-currency era.","[Wang, Yizhi; Lucey, Brian M.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Business Sch, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Lucey, Brian M.] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Inst Business Res, 59C Nguyen Dinh Chieu,Ward 6,Dist 3, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Lucey, Brian M.] Jiangxi Univ Econ & Finance, Inst Ind Econ, 169, East Shuanggang Rd, Xialuo, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Vigne, Samuel A.] LUISS Univ, LUISS Business Sch, Rome, Italy; [Yarovaya, Larisa] Univ Southampton, Ctr Digital Finance, Highfield Campus, Southampton, England","","Wang, YZ (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Business Sch, Dublin 2, Ireland.","wangy27@tcd.ie","Wang, Yizhi/GLT-2360-2022","Yarovaya, Larisa/0000-0002-9638-2917","China Scholarship Council [:202008300011]","China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)","Acknowledgments The authors would like to acknowledge the support of The China Scholarship Council (project code:202008300011) .","","119","1","1","12","12","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","0040-1625","1873-5509","","TECHNOL FORECAST SOC","Technol.

Nevertheless, limited studies have investigated the barriers to blockchain adoption in the CE. This study aims to close the knowledge gap by providing a comprehensive review of the barriers hampering the adoption and integration of blockchain technology in the CE. An integrated approach based on fuzzy Delphi and best-worst methods has been applied to analyze and rank the barriers. Sixteen barriers to blockchain adoption in the CE were identified from the academic literature and validated by a panel of experts. The findings from the fuzzy Delphi technique identified ten significant barriers for further analysis. Then, using the best-worst method, the optimal weights were determined based on the experts' judgment to recognize the importance of each barrier. The findings from this method showed that a lack of knowledge and management support, reluctance to change and technological immaturity are the most significant barriers. In contrast, the least significant barriers are investment costs, security risks, and scalability issues. Theoretically, this study is the first to apply an integrated approach combining fuzzy Delphi and best-worst techniques to prioritze the barriers to blockchain adoption in the CE. It also provides valuable insights for managers and decision-makers that can be used to optimize blockchain implementations in the CE.","[Rejeb, Abderahman] Szechenyi Istvan Univ, Doctoral Sch Reg Sci & Business Adm, H-9026 Gyor, Hungary; [Rejeb, Karim] Univ Carthage, Fac Sci Bizerte, Zarzouna 7021, Bizerte, Tunisia; [Keogh, John G.] McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, McGill Ctr Convergence Hlth & Econ MCCHE, Montreal, PQ H3A 0G4, Canada; [Zailani, Suhaiza] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Dept Operat Management & Informat Syst, Kuala Lumpur 50203, Malaysia","","Rejeb, A (corresponding author), Szechenyi Istvan Univ, Doctoral Sch Reg Sci & Business Adm, H-9026 Gyor, Hungary.","rejeb.abderahman@sze.hu; karim.rejeb@fsb.ucar.tn; john.keogh@mcgill.ca; shmz@um.edu.my","Zailani, Suhaiza/ABB-3206-2021; Zailani, Suhaiza/A-2968-2013","Zailani, Suhaiza/0000-0002-8484-1821; Zailani, Suhaiza/0000-0002-8484-1821; Keogh, John/0000-0002-7332-110X","Szechenyi Istvan University","Szechenyi Istvan University","This research is funded by Szechenyi Istvan University (SZE).","","119","2","2","18","18","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2071-1050","","SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL","Sustainability","MAR","2022","14","6","","","","","","","3611","10.3390/su14063611","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14063611","","","23","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","0B1GJ","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000774390400001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Statistical evidence shows that clean energy is not a direct hedge for either of types. However, it serves as at least a weak safe haven for both in extreme bearish markets. Moreover, clean energy is more likely to be a safe haven for dirty cryptocurrencies than clean cryptocurrencies during increased uncertainty.

Equity seems to have performed much better despite its inherent risk. Although, investors prefer safe-haven assets, they are increasingly moving to equities in search for better returns. We consider whether equity could be a safe-haven investment if chosen from quality stocks' basket. We examine the safe-haven and hedging properties of the Nifty-50 constituent stocks over the period 2008-2020. To address this, we employ copula-based framework to model the dependence structure between stocks and five indices. We distinguish between safe-haven attributes and hedging features of the individual stocks. We show that the safe-haven properties of the Nifty-50 listed stocks are not as concentrated as gold but they show much low co-movement with the market. We call them pseudo-safe-haven as they are the safe-bets for investors seeking relatively safe-haven assets with impressive returns.","[Sri, Janani S.; Kayal, Parthajit] Madras Sch Econ MSE, Gandhi Mandapam Rd, Chennai 600025, Tamil Nadu, India; [Balasubramanian, G.] KREA Univ, IFMR Grad Sch Business, Sri City, Andhra Pradesh, India","","Kayal, P (corresponding author), Madras Sch Econ MSE, Gandhi Mandapam Rd, Chennai 600025, Tamil Nadu, India.","parthajitkayal@gmail.com","","Kayal, Parthajit/0000-0001-7741-5800; Sree Ganesh, Janani Sri/0000-0003-2924-7544","","","","","71","2","2","2","3","SAGE PUBLICATIONS INDIA  PVT LTD","NEW DELHI","B-1-I-1 MOHAN CO-OPERATIVE INDUSTRIAL AREA, MATHURA RD, POST BAG NO 7, NEW DELHI 110 044, INDIA","0972-6527","0973-0710","","J EMERG MARK FINANC","J.

Our results indicate that each cryptocurrency covered in the study presented bubbles. Moreover, we found that explosive behavior in one currency leads to explosivity in other cryptocurrencies. During the pandemic, herd behavior was evident among investors; however, this diminishes during bubbles, indicating that bubbles are not explained by herd behavior. Regarding cryptocurrency and market-specific factors, we found that Google Trends and volume are positively associated with predicting speculative bubbles in time-series and panel probit regressions. Hence, investors should exercise caution when investing in cryptocurrencies and follow both crypto currency and market-related factors to estimate bubbles. Alternative liquidity, volatility, and Google Trends measures are used for robustness analysis and yield similar results. Overall, our results suggest that bubble behavior is common in the cryptocurrency market, contradicting the efficient market hypothesis.","[Haykir, Ozkan] Nigde Omer Halisdemir Univ, Finance & Banking Dept, Nigde, Turkey; [Yagli, Ibrahim] Nevsehir Haci Bektas Veli Univ, Accounting & Finance Dept, Nevsehir, Turkey","","Haykir, O (corresponding author), Nigde Omer Halisdemir Univ, Finance & Banking Dept, Nigde, Turkey.","ozkanhaykir@gmail.com","","HAYKIR, OZKAN/0000-0003-2800-8699","","","","","134","0","0","1","1","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","2199-4730","","FINANC INNOV","Financ.

Our results demonstrate that health shocks appear to influence the system-wide dynamic connectedness, which reaches a peak during the COVID-19 pandemic. Net total directional connectedness sug-gests that the gold and stock markets consistently appear to be net receivers of spillover shocks. Crude oil appears to be a critical net transmitter of shocks for almost the whole pre-COVID-19 pandemic period, but it turns into an important net receiver during the COVID-19 pandemic. The cryptocurrency market acts as the time-varying net receiver and net transmitter of our network, and it has the most inconsiderable role within our studied network. Pairwise connectedness reveals that crude oil and stock are mostly receiving spillover effects from all the other markets, while gold could be either a net transmitter or a net receiver, depending on the types of market considered.

We applied a TVP-VAR model and bivariate wavelet coherence approach to capture co-movements both in the time and frequency domain considering short-, medium- and long-term investment horizons. Using daily returns from 1 June 2012 to 4 June 2021, the results of the TVP-VAR model show that individual REEs and the EVFMI have strong return connectedness and are heterogenous over time. The bivariate wavelet coherence approach reveals that Dysprosium, Neodymium, Praseodymium and Terbium returns have positive co-movement (in-phase) with the EVFMI in the medium-term and long-term. In contrast, Cerium, Europium, Lanthanum and Yttrium returns have negative co-movements (out-phase) with the EVFMI in the medium-term and long-term. We find strong positive co-movements between the MVIS Global Rare Earth/Strategic Metals Index (MVREMX) and EVFMI at multiple wavelet scales. Following the lead/lag relationship, Cerium, Europium and Lanthanum, Yttrium returns are leading the EVFMI, and Neodymium, Dysprosium, Praseodymium, Terbium and MVREMX returns are lagging to the EVFMI. This study, therefore, suggests heterogenous hedging and diversification properties of REEs over time and investment horizons. Specifically, Cerium, Europium, Lanthanum and Yttrium act as strong hedges in long-term investment horizons and Neodymium, Dysprosium, Praseodymium and Terbium are weak hedges or diversifiers in short-term investment horizons. These results may be of particular interest to investors and relevant to policymakers considering multiple investment horizons.","[Ul Haq, Inzamam] Univ Management & Technol, Knowledge Unit Business Econ Accountancy & Commer, Sialkot Campus, Sialkot 51310, Pakistan; [Ferreira, Paulo] VALORIZA Res Ctr Endogenous Resource Valorizat, P-7300555 Portalegre, Portugal; [Ferreira, Paulo] Inst Politecn Portalegre, P-7300110 Portalegre, Portugal; [Ferreira, Paulo] Univ Evora, Ctr Estudos & Formacao Avancada Gestao & Econ Uni, Largo Colegiais 2, P-7004516 Evora, Portugal; [Maneengam, Apichit] King Mongkuts Univ Technol North Bangkok, Coll Ind Technol, Dept Mech Engn Technol, Bangkok 10800, Thailand; [Wisetsri, Worakamol] King Mongkuts Univ Technol North Bangkok KMUTNB, Fac Appl Arts, Dept Social Sci, Bangkok 10800, Thailand","","Wisetsri, W (corresponding author), King Mongkuts Univ Technol North Bangkok KMUTNB, Fac Appl Arts, Dept Social Sci, Bangkok 10800, Thailand.","inzamam.uh894@gmail.com; pferreira@ipportalegre.pt; apichit.m@cit.kmutnb.ac.th; worakamol.w@arts.kmutnb.ac.th","Maneengam, Apichit/AAD-4792-2020; Ferreira, Paulo/P-9622-2016","Maneengam, Apichit/0000-0002-5989-5764; Ferreira, Paulo/0000-0003-1951-889X; Ul Haq, Inzamam/0000-0003-4237-6287; WISETSRI, WORAKAMOL/0000-0002-9512-174X","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UIDB/05064/2020, UIDB/04007/2020]","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission)","Paulo Ferreira acknowledges the financial support of Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (grants UIDB/05064/2020 and UIDB/04007/2020).","","52","0","0","0","0","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-9091","","RISKS","Risks","JUL","2022","10","7","","","","","","","137","10.3390/risks10070137","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/risks10070137","","","20","Business, Finance","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Business & Economics","3G5AS","","gold","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000831367900001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We use daily data set from July 2011 to June 2021, and employ the extended joint connectedness approach of Balcilar et al. (2021), which has several advantages over traditional connectedness models. Our findings show that traditional determinants of US financial stress are dynamic and change in response to the monetary injections in late 2019 more as compared with the COVID-19. In spite of the importance of COVID-19, our analysis points towards the enhanced significance of US monetary injections in driving joint connectedness between financial stress and its prominent factors and strategic commodities. Further, gold and oil show diversification potential in a portfolio of US stocks, financial sector and broad market volatilities.

Grounded in the sustainability transition literature, this paper addresses this gap through the following research question: What role does blockchain play in the transition to a circular economy? Following an abductive approach, we conducted interviews with ground-level experts implementing blockchain innovations for the circular economy across Europe and the United States. Through a thematic analysis, we derived a theoretical model of the relationships among (1) drivers and barriers of the transition to a circular economy, (2) blockchain innovation for the circular economy, (3) technical challenges of blockchain, and (4) the circular economy. While blockchain plays a moderating role, interviewees considered it only an infrastructural resource rather than a panacea.","[Boehmecke-Schwafert, Moritz; Wehinger, Marie] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Technol & Management, Berlin, Germany; [Teigland, Robin] Chalmers Univ Technol, Gothenburg, Sweden","","Bohmecke-Schwafert, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, Str 17,Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.","moritz.boehmecke-schwafert@tu-berlin.de","","","","","","","85","4","4","35","35","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0964-4733","1099-0836","","BUS STRATEG ENVIRON","Bus.

Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a systematic literature review (SLR) of 346 research products available on Scopus, which were mapped with bibliometric analyses and critically discussed in relation to three main topics: the impact of blockchain on accounting and auditing, cryptoassets and finance, business models and supply chain management. Findings Blockchain has many potential implications for accounting practice and research. In addition to providing the state-of-the-art of accounting research on blockchain and additional avenues for further studies, this study discusses why practitioners are interested in this technology: triple-entry bookkeeping, the inalterability of transactions, the automation of repetitive tasks that do not require discretionary choices, the representation of cryptocurrencies in financial statements, value-chain management, social and environmental auditing and reporting and business model innovation. Originality/value The novel contribution of this study is integrated and threefold. First, this SLR provides a clear picture of the state of the accounting research on blockchain using bibliographic and narrative analyses. Second, it investigates how accounting and auditing practices are impacted by blockchain. Third, it contributes to the accounting literature with its discussion of the potential future research trends related to blockchain for accounting.","[Bellucci, Marco; Manetti, Giacomo] Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Florence, Italy; [Bianchi, Damiano Cesa] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Pisa, Italy","","Manetti, G (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Florence, Italy.","giacomo.manetti@unifi.it","CESA BIANCHI, DAMIANO\\/GQQ-0412-2022; Bellucci, Marco/I-4254-2015","CESA BIANCHI, DAMIANO\\/0000-0001-8215-983X; Bellucci, Marco/0000-0002-4014-4418","","","","","112","1","1","43","43","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","2049-372X","2049-3738","","MEDITARI ACCOUNT RES","Meditari Account.

Our wavelet-based analysis suggests that ICEA is sharply escalated after the first quarter of 2021.

Accordingly, the clean energy, sustainability, and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) stock indices are positively associated with ICEA during 2018-2019 at the medium frequency bands. In most periods and frequency domains, most commodities, GBs, and environment-related stocks are not strongly linked to ICEA. Moreover, Diebold and Yilmaz's (2014) spillover estimations signify no strong spillover effect of ICEA on the asset classes considered in this study. These findings are further corroborated by the wavelet-based Granger causality analysis. Moreover, our quantile regression (QR) estimations suggest that most assets are adversely influenced by ICEA, depending on the market conditions.

Indeed, despite the use of cryptocurrencies for electronic commerce spreading worldwide at a fast and growing pace, there are supporters and detractors among their users. The analysis of what distinguish these two groups of users is fundamental for understanding their different intention to use cryptocurrencies for electronic commerce. Design/methodology/approach A survey has been administered to 2,532 cryptocurrencies' users across the USA and China, collecting data on their behavioral predispositions and cultural features. Results were then analyzed through structured equation modeling. Findings Results showed that while attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and herding behavior have a positive impact on the intention to use cryptocurrencies for electronic commerce, financial literacy has no influence. Cultural dimensions amplified or reduced the discovered relationships and caused different effects: positive for the USA and negative for China when considering illegal attitude and perceived risk. Originality/value Theory of planned behavior, financial behavior and cultural factors can, all together, represent a useful framework for envisioning the behavior of users in adopting cryptocurrencies for electronic commerce purposes through a test of all its elements. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study considering behavior and cultural variables on the intention to use cryptocurrencies for electronic commerce as well as being the largest carried out, in terms of sample, on the cryptocurrency topic.","[Cristofaro, Matteo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Management & Law, Fac Econ, Rome, Italy; [Giardino, Pier Luigi] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Trento, Italy; [Misra, Sanjay] Ostfold Univ Coll, Dept Comp Sci & Commun, Halden Campus Lib, Halden, Norway; [Quoc Trung Pham; Hai Hiep Phan] Vietnam Natl Univ, Sch Ind Management, HCMC Univ Informat Technol, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","","Cristofaro, M (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Management & Law, Fac Econ, Rome, Italy.","matteo.cristofaro@uniroma2.it","Misra, Sanjay/K-2203-2014","Misra, Sanjay/0000-0002-3556-9331; Giardino, Pier Luigi/0000-0003-2820-610X","","","","","87","0","0","5","5","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","2040-8269","2040-8277","","MANAG RES REV","Manag.

Malaysia's Securities Commission (SC) announced in October 2021 that over MYR 16 billion (USD 3.85 billion) involving digital assets and cryptocurrencies were traded between August 2020 and September 2021. Since cryptocurrencies are issued by private corporations and are technically beyond the federal government's control, criminals may use them for illegal reasons such as money laundering and terrorist funding. Consequently, it is vital to examine why investors are engaged in cryptocurrency in the first place. This study aims to provide insight into Malaysian investors' perceptions by evaluating the influence of perceived risk and perceived value on their cryptocurrency adoption decision. The retail investors' demographic characteristics (gender, age, education, income, and investment experience) were analyzed as control variables. Data were gathered using purposive sampling, and responses from 211 respondents from various cities in Malaysia were used in the final analysis. Data were examined using Smart PLS Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). Based on the finding's, perceived value was found to have a significant influence on cryptocurrency adoption. Meanwhile, perceived risk had no significant influence on the adoption of cryptocurrency among the Malaysian investors.","[Sukumaran, Shangeetha; Bee, Thai Siew] Multimedia Univ, Fac Management, Persiaran Multimedia, Cyberjaya 63100, Malaysia; [Wasiuzzaman, Shaista] Univ Teknol Brunei, Sch Business, BE-1410 Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei","","Bee, TS (corresponding author), Multimedia Univ, Fac Management, Persiaran Multimedia, Cyberjaya 63100, Malaysia.","1151103718@student.mmu.edu.my; sbthai@mmu.edu.my; dr.shaista@utb.edu.bn","","Sukumaran, Shangeetha/0000-0003-4881-9974; Siew Bee, Thai/0000-0003-4419-0857","Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia [FRGS/1/2019/SS01/MMU/03/21, MMUE/190037.02]","Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia(Ministry of Education, Malaysia)","This research and APC was funded by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2019/SS01/MMU/03/21), provided by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia.

The application of new technologies like blockchain can benefit sustainable energy supply chains by improving chain and logistics operations in the areas of trust, transparency and accountability, cooperation, information sharing, financial exchanges, and supply chain integration. However, the efforts to adopt such technologies in supply chains tend to face many challenges and challenges, which can seriously threaten their success. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully examine the challenges to blockchain technology application. This research focuses on identifying the criteria and challenges to the application of blockchain in renewable energy supply chains and also ranks the identified challenges in terms of their capacity to disrupt the process. The applicability of the suggested structure is examined in a case study of the renewable energy supply chain of Iran. In this study, the challenges are evaluated and ranked by the hybrid developed methods by the integration of the concept of gray numbers into the gray stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA-Gray) and the gray evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS-Gray). Another group of hybrid methods including the gray weighted sum method (WSM-Gray), the gray complex proportional assessment (COPRAS-Gray), and the gray technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS-Gray) is used to validate the results. The rankings obtained from all of these techniques show high degree of correlation. Among the identified challenges, high investment cost is found to be the most important challenge to the application of blockchain in sustainable energy supply chains.","[Almutairi, Khalid] Univ Hafr Al Batin, Appl Coll, Mech Engn Technol, Hafar al Batin, Saudi Arabia; [Dehshiri, Seyyed Jalaladdin Hosseini] Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Management & Accounting, Dept Ind Management, Tehran, Iran; [Dehshiri, Seyyed Shahabaddin Hosseini] Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Hoa, Ao Xuan] Tay Nguyen Univ, Fac Econ, Buon Ma Thuot City, Dak Lak Provinc, Vietnam; [Dhanraj, Joshuva Arockia] Hindustan Inst Technol & Sci, Ctr Automat & Robot ANRO, Dept Mech Engn, Chennai 603103, Tamil Nadu, India; [Mostafaeipour, Ali] Yazd Univ, Ind Engn Dept, Yazd, Iran; [Dhanraj, Joshuva Arockia; Mostafaeipour, Ali; Techato, Kuaanan] Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Environm Management, Environm Assessment & Technol Hazardous Waste Man, Hat Yai 90110, Songkhla, Thailand; [Dhanraj, Joshuva Arockia; Mostafaeipour, Ali; Techato, Kuaanan] Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Environm Management, Hat Yai 90112, Songkhla, Thailand; [Issakhov, Alibek] Al Farabi Kazakh Natl Univ, Fac Mech & Math, Dept Math & Comp Modelling, Alma Ata 050040, Kazakhstan; [Issakhov, Alibek] Kazakh British Tech Univ, Dept Math & Cybernet, Alma Ata 50000, Kazakhstan","","Techato, K (corresponding author), Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Environm Management, Environm Assessment & Technol Hazardous Waste Man, Hat Yai 90110, Songkhla, Thailand.;Techato, K (corresponding author), Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Environm Management, Hat Yai 90112, Songkhla, Thailand.","kuaanan.t@psu.ac.th","Hosseini Dehshiri, Seyyed Jalaladdin/AAB-1449-2022; Hosseini Dehshiri, Seyyed Shahabaddin/AGX-8461-2022; Almutairi, Khalid/GNW-5982-2022; Arockia Dhanraj, Joshuva/N-6563-2018","Hosseini Dehshiri, Seyyed Jalaladdin/0000-0001-7031-1259; Hosseini Dehshiri, Seyyed Shahabaddin/0000-0002-1368-3889; Almutairi, Khalid/0000-0003-1164-7777; Arockia Dhanraj, Joshuva/0000-0001-5048-7775","","","","","114","4","4","18","27","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","0944-1344","1614-7499","","ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R","Environ.

For this purpose, we resort to the bi- and multiple wavelet econometric approaches. Findings from the bivariate wavelet analysis evidence the significant influence of the US financial stress in driving the price-generating process in commodities markets. Our findings support the hedging abilities of commodities across the time-frequency space. Findings from the multiple correlations explicate that the interrelation between the commodities and financial stress is attributable to their interdependence in the long term during financial market meltdowns. The dynamic and nonhomogeneous lead/lag relations underscored by our findings highlight the importance of cross-commodity investments. As such, by acknowledging the response of different commodities to financial stress, asset allocation should factor in commodities that offer opposing responses to a financial stress to hedge downside risks associated with portfolios. Our findings are of interest to regulators, risk managers, investors, and commodities producers.","[Armah, Mohammed] Ghana Inst Management & Publ Adm GIMPA, Sch Business, Accra, Ghana; [Amewu, Godfred] Univ Ghana, Sch Business, Dept Finance, Legon, Ghana; [Bossman, Ahmed] Univ Cape Coast, Sch Business, Dept Finance, Cape Coast, Ghana","","Armah, M (corresponding author), Ghana Inst Management & Publ Adm, Accounting & Finance, Accra, Ghana.","mohsarmah33@gmail.com","","Bossman, Ahmed/0000-0001-9539-0889","","","","","77","0","0","0","0","TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS","OSLO","KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY","2332-2039","","","COGENT ECON FINANC","Cogent Econ.

We found that crude oil cannot act as safe haven instrument for stock markets in oil-exporting African countries. Notably, the oil-stock co-movement is consistent and more intense at the lower tails only. Investors are encouraged to employ oil as a diversification instrument rather than as a safe haven asset, based on market conditions. Regulators should devise strategies to strengthen the market for crude oil to lessen adverse volatilities during the COVID-19 pandemic by way of mitigating downward returns in African stock markets.

We estimate the network connectedness using the standard, quantile, frequency, and lasso VAR models for the pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic periods and daily data over the period from October 2, 2017 to May 20, 2022. The network connectedness estimates based on the several models used in this study indicate a growing risk spillover among and within the emerging market equities and the cryptocurrencies after the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world. The frequency connectedness analysis shows that cryptocurrencies cannot be used as diversifiers for emerging stock markets in both the short and long-run. The empirical findings from the quantile VAR model reveal that the volatility connectedness in the tails is much stronger compared to the center of the distribution. It is also evident that Saudi Arabia, Thailand's stock markets, and USDT are the main risk transmitters at the 0.95-th quantile during the post-COVID period. Time-varying connectedness estimates confirm the substantial effect of COVID-19. Our study also shows that the spread of risk among these financial markets is global rather than regional, supporting cross-border structure and worldwide financial market integration.

Return series of the model, generated by Monte Carlo simulations, can reproduce a number of stylized facts of real cryptocurrency data. Additionally, we apply the composite multiscale fuzzy entropy algorithm and the matching energy method to detecting the complexity of price volatility behaviours in both actual and simulated cryptocurrency markets.

Soybean markets weakly hedge cryptocurrency policy uncertainty, US economic policy uncertainty, and crude oil volatility. In addition, GSCI commodity and crude oil also offer a weak safe-haven property against cryptocurrency uncertainties and GPR.

From August 22, 2012, through September 17, 2021, the daily bond yield indices for Islamic and G6 markets were employed. The findings reveal that volatility spillovers between and within Islamic and/or G6 bond markets are time- and frequency-dependent, although conventional bonds are more volatile than Islamic bonds during Black Swan periods. Across all time horizons, USA, UK, and Canada are the biggest producers of shocks to the Islamic and G6 markets, with Pakistan being the lowest shocks transmitter. During the European debt crisis, Brexit, and COVID-19 periods, the results underscore delayed contagious spillovers emanating from USA, Canada, and UK. With both the Islamic and G6 bond markets, short-term spillovers are more important than long-term spillovers. Investors should use their understanding of market trends and volatility to hedge their holdings against poorer asset returns when volatility spillover is more severe during market turmoil. Spillovers should be closely monitored by policymakers, since they jeopardise cross-market linkages.","[Owusu, Peterson Junior, Jr.] Univ Cape Coast, Sch Business, Dept Finance, Cape Coast, Ghana","","Owusu, P (corresponding author), Univ Cape Coast, Sch Business, Dept Finance, Cape Coast, Ghana.","peterson.owusu@ucc.edu.gh","Owusu Junior, Peterson/GPX-9651-2022","Owusu Junior, Peterson/0000-0001-6253-5770","","","","","77","0","0","6","6","HINDAWI LTD","LONDON","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","1026-0226","1607-887X","","DISCRETE DYN NAT SOC","Discrete Dyn.

Our paper provides evidence for volatility connectedness on cryptocurrencies. The different econometric techniques, including the stochastic volatility (SVOL) model and time-varying parameter VAR models using a quasi-Bayesian local likelihood (QBLL), are applied to measure the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Using high-frequency, intra-day data of the largest cryptocurrencies over 2018-2021, we detect the great volatility of the cryptocurrency market are the beginning of 2019, the beginning of 2020, and throughout the year of 2021. The total connectedness values suggest that the cryptocurrency market becomes volatile as the new strains of the COVID-19 appear at the end of 2021. However, by using directional connectedness, we reveal that there are negative and positive spillovers from a specific cryptocurrency to other cryptocurrencies. The great fluctuations in the period before the COVID-19 health crisis stem from the positive resonance (symmetric) between the volatility of each cryptocurrency, while this health crisis leads to substantially positive and negative spillovers (asymmetric) of cryptocurrencies, and this makes market volatility weaker than it actually is.","[Ha, Le Thanh; Dai, Nguyen Van] Natl Econ Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam","","Ha, L (corresponding author), Natl Econ Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam.","halethanh.kt@gmail.com; dainv@neu.edu.vn","","Le, Ha/0000-0002-4517-9097","National Economics University [D.i h.c Kinh t.

We employ the conditional correlation multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (MGARCH) to investigate this stock-precious metals nexus in terms of return and volatility spillovers. The study assesses impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on the stock-precious metals nexus and further examine this relationship by supplementing the Twitter's Daily Happiness Sentiment index to the methodological framework for the period from 01 January 2020 to 03 May 2021. We find that precious metals positively influence stock markets before the Covid-19 outbreak and firmly play a valuable role due to their hedge and safe haven characteristics. In contrast, the bivariate GARCH framework does not provide statistically significant evidence on the stock-precious metals nexus during the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the trivariate GARCH approach with stock markets, precious metals, and happiness sentiment indexes reveals sufficiently complicated interactions between these return series. Prominently, past change in the happiness index negatively affects the stock returns but positively drives the performance of precious metals. These findings indirectly demonstrate the stock-precious metals nexus under impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and reflect the demand of precious metals during crisis periods. Accordingly, we suggest a reasonable method of adjusting the proxies when no interaction effect is significantly found during unprecedented outbreaks.","[Le Van; Nguyen Khac Quoc Bao] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City UEH Univ, UEH Coll Technol & Design, 59C Nguyen Dinh Chieu St,Ward 6,Dist 3, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Le Van; Nguyen Khac Quoc Bao] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City UEH Univ, UEH Coll Business, Sch Finance, 59C Nguyen Dinh Chieu St,Ward 6,Dist 3, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","","Van, L (corresponding author), Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City UEH Univ, UEH Coll Technol & Design, 59C Nguyen Dinh Chieu St,Ward 6,Dist 3, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.;Van, L (corresponding author), Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City UEH Univ, UEH Coll Business, Sch Finance, 59C Nguyen Dinh Chieu St,Ward 6,Dist 3, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.","Levan@ueh.edu.vn; Nguyenbao@ueh.edu.vn","","Le, Van/0000-0002-6428-8731","University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH University)","University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH University)","This study is supported by University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH University).","","102","1","1","12","12","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0301-4207","1873-7641","","RESOUR POLICY","Resour.

The focus of this paper is to examine the role of bullish, neutral, and bearish investors' sentiments on the connection between the five (5) most traded crypto-currencies and the precious metals market. The following findings are perceptible from our analyses. First, in the spillover tests, there exists a significant high level of connection between the two markets. Second, the spillover results also reveal that tetherum and silver are net receivers of the shocks, while most of the cryptocurrencies are net transmitters of the volatility. Third, the BDS test shows strong evidence of non -linearity is a very crucial factor to be put into consideration when examining the role of investors' senti-ments on the interactions between the cryptocurrency and precious metals markets. Fourth, the non -parametric causality-in-quantile test confirms that the connectedness between the cryptocurrency and precious metal markets is speculation driven.

To mitigate the effects of estimation risk, we employ the Bayes-Stein model with no short-selling and variance-based constraints. We estimate the inputs using lasso regression and elastic net regression, employing the shrunk Wishart stochastic volatility model and Gaussian random projection. We consider nine cryptocurrency asset categories, and find that all but two provide significant out-of-sample diversification benefits. The lower is investor risk aversion, the more beneficial are cryptocurrencies as portfolio diversifiers. During uncertain economic environments, such as the post-Covid-19 period, cryptocurrencies provide the same diversification benefits as in more stable environments. Our results are robust to different portfolio benchmarks, regression technique, transaction cost, portfolio constraints, higher moments and Black-Litterman models.","[Huang, Xinyu; Han, Weihao; Newton, David; Platanakis, Emmanouil] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath, Avon, England; [Stafylas, Dimitrios] Univ York, York Management Sch, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Sutcliffe, Charles] Univ Reading, ICMA Ctr, Henley Business Sch, Reading, Berks, England","","Newton, D (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath, Avon, England.","d.newton@bath.ac.uk","","Han, Weihao/0000-0002-9929-5245; Newton, David/0000-0001-6891-5686; Platanakis, Emmanouil/0000-0003-1493-6339","","","","","87","0","0","17","17","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1351-847X","1466-4364","","EUR J FINANC","Eur.

We investigate the time-varying volatility connectedness between the two markets using their realized variances and semi-variances. Employing a multivariate Heterogeneous Autoregressive model, which accounts for both long memory and structural breaks in realized volatility time series, we find that China's thermal coal futures market is significantly dependent on the cryptocurrency market's volatility while the impact of the energy market on the cryptocurrency market is inconsequential. Moreover, the connectedness is asymmetrical in the sense that the bad volatility connectedness is greater than the good volatility connectedness. Finally, the determinants of the dynamic connectedness highlight the role of the production channel in fuelling the volatility transmission between these two markets.","[Pham, Son Duy; Thao Thac Thanh Nguyen; Hung Xuan Do] Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Auckland, New Zealand; [Hung Xuan Do] Vietnam Natl Univ, Int Sch, Hanoi, Vietnam","","Do, HX (corresponding author), Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance Albany, Massey Business Sch, Auckland, New Zealand.","D.Pham@massey.ac.nz; T.T.T.Nguyen1@massey.ac.nz; H.Do@massey.ac.nz","","Pham, Son/0000-0001-9151-8769","Massey Business School via the REaDI funding","Massey Business School via the REaDI funding","Hung Do acknowledges research support provided by Massey Business School via the REaDI funding.","","93","0","0","4","4","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0140-9883","1873-6181","","ENERG ECON","Energy Econ.","AUG","2022","112","","","","","","","","106114","10.1016/j.eneco.2022.106114","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2022.106114","","","24","Economics","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Business & Economics","3I7CU","","","","","2022-09-26","WOS:000832870700007","View Full Record in Web of Science"

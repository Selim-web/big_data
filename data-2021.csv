This research uses a qualitative approach. The data source comes from a literature review on cryptocurrency and opinions from Bitcoin academics, traders, and investors. Data collection was conducted through desk evaluations and interviews to determine what attributes should be considered for assessing Bitcoin literacy. The results of a literature review reinforced by discussion show that eight attributes can be used to assess basic level Bitcoin literacy, namely Bitcoin supply, regulatory guarantees, transaction recording, the role of third parties, treatment of transfer transactions, initial coin offerings, the smallest Bitcoin unit, and conversion with another currency. These eight attributes can be used to measure Bitcoin literacy through various questions with the choice of true, false, and do not know answers. This research is essential because there is no method to measure Bitcoin literacy. This research can be a measuring tool that becomes a reference or standard in assessing or measuring Bitcoin literacy. This study's results provide benefits to the development of science in the form of a tool that can be used to assess Bitcoin literacy and become a standard in assessing a person's level of understanding of Bitcoin.","[Hidajat, Taofik; Kristanto, Rudi Suryo] STIE Bank BPD Jawa Tengah, Management Dept, Soekarno Hatta 88, Semarang 50196, Central Java, Indonesia; [Octrina, Fajra] Telkom Univ, Management Dept, Jawa Barat, Indonesia","Universitas Telkom","Hidajat, T (corresponding author), STIE Bank BPD Jawa Tengah, Management Dept, Soekarno Hatta 88, Semarang 50196, Central Java, Indonesia.","inidotcom@yahoo.com; rudisk@yahoo.com; octrinafajra@gmail.com","Hidajat, Taofik/E-3520-2015","Hidajat, Taofik/0000-0003-1616-9778","STIE Bank BPD Jateng [004/SKP P3M/STIEBPD/04/2020]","STIE Bank BPD Jateng","This research was supported by STIE Bank BPD Jateng.

Particularly, we estimate the transfer entropy between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as an information-theoretic approach. When a symbolic analysis is applied, asymmetric information flow from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash is observed. We further provide evidence that this relationship is due to the role of liquidity in price leadership. Our findings suggest that (i) investors could forecast the fluctuation of price evolution in the Bitcoin Cash using the rise-fall pattern of Bitcoin price and (ii) policymakers (regulators) must closely monitor the information flow between the two markets, in a state with strong market integration, to prevent market distortion and regulatory arbitrage.

Unlike fiat currencies, there is no centralized authority or any statutory recognition, backing, or regulation for Bitcoin. All transactions are confirmed for validity by a network of volunteer nodes (miners) and after collective agreement is subsequently recorded into a distributed ledger Blockchain. Bitcoin platform has attracted both social and anti-social elements. On the one hand, it is social as it ensures the exchange of value, maintaining trust in a cooperative, community-driven manner without the need for a trusted third party. At the same time, it is anti-social as it creates hurdles for law enforcement to trace suspicious transactions due to anonymity and privacy. To understand how the social and anti-social tendencies in the user base of Bitcoin affect its evolution, there is a need to analyze the Bitcoin system as a network. The current paper aims to explore the local topology and geometry of the Bitcoin network during its first decade of existence. Bitcoin transaction data from 03 Jan 2009 12:45:05 GMT to 08 May 2020 13:21:33 GMT was processed for this purpose to build a Bitcoin user graph. The characteristics, local and global network properties of the user's graph were analyzed at ten intervals between 2009 and 2020 with a gap of one year. Small diameter, skewed distribution of transactions, power-law distributed in and out degrees, disconnected graph, and presence of large connected components were the observations from network analysis. Thus, it could be inferred that despite anti-social tendencies, Bitcoin network shared similarities with other complex networks. Network analysis also uncovered twenty types of legal and anti-social entities operating on Bitcoin and provided a path for uncovering these anti-social entities.","[Nerurkar, Pranav] NMIMS Univ, Dept Data Sci, MPSTME, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Nerurkar, Pranav; Patel, Dhiren] VJTI, Dept CE&IT, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Busnel, Yann; Ludinard, Romaric] IMT Atlantique, SRCD Dept, Rennes, France; [Kumari, Saru] Ch Charan Singh Univ, Dept Math, Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Khan, Muhammad Khurram] King Saud Univ, Ctr Excellence Informat Assurance CoEIA, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","SVKM's NMIMS (Deemed to be University); Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI); IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; IMT Atlantique; Chaudhary Charan Singh University; King Saud University","Kumari, S (corresponding author), Ch Charan Singh Univ, Dept Math, Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, India.","saryusiirohi@gmail.com","Kumari, Saru/K-2038-2019; KHAN, MUHAMMAD KHURRAM/E-4836-2014","Kumari, Saru/0000-0003-4929-5383; KHAN, MUHAMMAD KHURRAM/0000-0001-6636-0533; Busnel, Yann/0000-0001-6908-719X; nerurkar, pranav/0000-0002-9100-6437; Ludinard, Romaric/0000-0002-4997-4813","Raman Charpak Fellowship of the Indo-French Centre for the Promotion of Advanced Research [IFC/4132/RCF 2019/716]; King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [RSP-2020/12]","Raman Charpak Fellowship of the Indo-French Centre for the Promotion of Advanced Research; King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University)","This work was supported in part by the Raman Charpak Fellowship of the Indo-French Centre for the Promotion of Advanced Research Grant no: IFC/4132/RCF 2019/716.

Our results indicate that the introduction of bitcoin futures potentially exerted a downward impact on the USD bitcoin spot market return and skewness and an upward one on volatility, kurtosis and liquidity, which became higher after futures were introduced.

Then, we modify the stochastic multifactor model in Schwartz and Smith (2000) and fit it to the Bitcoin futures prices data. The results show that the standard stochastic multifactor model performs well in explaining the fluctuations of Bitcoin futures prices and generates an upward volatility term structure of the Bitcoin futures contracts prices.

In a precise timeline, we show that the positive impact of tweets decays after approximately an hour. We further find that impacts on liquidity are stronger when tweets draw more attention.

However, due to the concept of change addresses (used to thwart replay attacks), temporal aspects are not directly applicable in the Bitcoin blockchain. Several pre-processing steps should be performed before such temporal aspects are utilized. We are motivated to study the Bitcoin transaction network and use the temporal features such as burst, attractiveness, and inter-event time along with several graph-based properties such as the degree of node and clustering coefficient to validate the applicability of already existing approaches known for other cryptocurrency blockchains on the Bitcoin blockchain. We generate the temporal and nontemporal feature set and train the Machine Learning (ML) algorithm over different temporal granularities to validate the state-of-the-art methods. We study the behavior of the addresses over different time granularities of the dataset. We identify that after applying change-address clustering, in Bitcoin, existing temporal features can be extracted and ML approaches can be applied. A comparative analysis of results show that the behavior of addresses in Ethereum and Bitcoin is similar with respect to in-degree, out-degree and inter-event time. Further, we identify 3 suspects that showed malicious behavior across different temporal granularities. These suspects are not marked as malicious in Bitcoin.","[Chaudhari, Deepesh; Agarwal, Rachit; Shukla, Sandeep Kumar] IIT Kanpur, CSE, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India","Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kanpur","Chaudhari, D (corresponding author), IIT Kanpur, CSE, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India.","deepesh@iitk.ac.in; rachitag@iitk.ac.in; sandeeps@iitk.ac.in","","","National Blockchain Project at IIT Kanpur - National Cyber Security Coordinator's office of the Government of India [NCSC/CS/2017518]; C3i Center from the Science and Engineering Research Board of the Government of India [SERB/CS/2016466]","National Blockchain Project at IIT Kanpur - National Cyber Security Coordinator's office of the Government of India; C3i Center from the Science and Engineering Research Board of the Government of India","This work is partially funded by the National Blockchain Project (grant number NCSC/CS/2017518) at IIT Kanpur sponsored by the National Cyber Security Coordinator's office of the Government of India and partially by the C3i Center funding from the Science and Engineering Research Board of the Government of India (grant number SERB/CS/2016466).","","19","0","0","1","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-1760-0","","","","2021","","","","","","","425","432","","10.1109/BLOCKCHAIN53845.2021.00066","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BLOCKCHAIN53845.2021.00066","","","8","","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","","BS9CN","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000779214600054","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Our results suggest that bitcoin price and mining rewards were intrinsically linked to bitcoin security outcomes.The bitcoin blockchain security's dependency on mining costs was geographically differenced - it was more significant for the global mining leader China than for other world regions. Bitcoin blockchain security tended to revert relatively fast to its equilibrium security level after the input or output of price shocks.","[Ciaian, Pavel; Kancs, D'Artis] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy; [Rajcaniova, Miroslava] Slovak Univ Agr Nitra SUA, Nitra, Slovakia; [Rajcaniova, Miroslava] Univ West Bohemia UWB, Plzen, Czech Republic","European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site","Ciaian, P (corresponding author), European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy.","ciaian@yahoo.com","Kancs, d'Artis/K-3374-2014; Rajcaniova, Miroslava/GNP-5216-2022; Ciaian, Pavel/B-4468-2010","Rajcaniova, Miroslava/0000-0003-4688-7690; Ciaian, Pavel/0000-0003-2405-5850","Slovak Research and Development Agency (Agentura na Podporu Vyskumu a Vyvoja) [APVV-18-0512]; Slovak Academy of Sciences (VEGA) [VEGA 1/0422/19]","Slovak Research and Development Agency (Agentura na Podporu Vyskumu a Vyvoja)(Slovak Research and Development Agency); Slovak Academy of Sciences (VEGA)(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA))","This work was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency (Agentura na Podporu Vyskumu a Vyvoja) under the contract No. APVV-18-0512 and and the Scientific Grant Agency of the Minister of Education, Science, Research and Sports and Slovak Academy of Sciences (VEGA) under the contract No. VEGA 1/0422/19.","","38","3","3","7","33","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0003-6846","1466-4283","","APPL ECON","Appl.

To account for the empirical findings, we build a model where users and miners together determine transaction fees and transaction volume. Even though the mechanism of fluctuating transaction fees in bit coin introduces an extra cost of uncertainty to users, a back-of-envelope calculation shows that the cost of using the bitcoin network for transactions is still smaller than the cost of using the current conventional payment system with a fixed transaction fee rate. However, this calculation may underestimate the cost due to the crowding-out effect on small transactions during the congested period. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, several schemes, such as the compact block protocol (BIP 152), have been proposed over the last few years to speed up the block propagation. Even so, we provide experimental evidence that (i) the vast majority (97%) of Bitcoin nodes exhibit only intermittent network connectivity (i.e., churn), and (ii) this churn results in significant number of unsuccessful compact blocks, roughly three times the statistic for continuously connected nodes. We conduct experiments on the Bitcoin network that show that churn results in a roughly five fold increase in block propagation time (i.e., 566.89 ms vs. 109.31 ms) on average. To effect our analysis, we develop a statistical model for churn, based on empirical network data, and use this model to actuate live test nodes on the Bitcoin network. The performance of the system is measured within a novel framework that we developed for logging the internal behavior of a Bitcoin node, and which we share for public use. Finally, to mitigate the problem of missing transactions in churning nodes, we propose and implement into Bitcoin Core a new synchronization protocol, dubbed MempoolSync. Our measurements show that churning nodes implementing MempoolSync experience significantly better performance than standard nodes not implementing MempoolSync, including average block propagation delay reduced by over 50%.","[Imtiaz, Muhammad Anas; Starobinski, David; Trachtenberg, Ari; Younis, Nabeel] Boston Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Boston University","Imtiaz, MA (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","maimtiaz@bu.edu; staro@bu.edu; trachten@bu.edu; nyounis@bu.edu","","Younis, Nabeel Samer/0000-0002-3646-6764","NSF [CCF-1563753]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was supported in part by NSF under grant CCF-1563753.

The parameters of the Bass model are estimated through Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimations. The diffusion curve of Bitcoin is developed based on the estimated parameters. The results indicate that the diffusion of Bitcoin has passed early adoption and takeoff periods and is close to maturity. The estimated diffusion process indicates that innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards had adopted Bitcoin.

This paper aims to describe Bitcoin's unique features that make it such an intriguing asset and proposes a new way to consider Bitcoin and its underlying value. Design/methodology/approach In this paper the author discusses Bitcoin's defining features that make it a unique asset. The author argues that Bitcoin should not be considered as a single purpose asset only, but rather as a new digital financial asset serving several functions, at least partially. The author discusses the role of Bitcoin in the traditional financial system, contrasts Bitcoin to gold, considers the implications of the continuance of expansionary policies on Bitcoin and discusses the impact of the emergence of cryptocurrencies as a new asset class on public policies. Findings In addition to functioning as a means of payment (at least partially) and a diversification tool, part of Bitcoin's value proposition stems from its worth as a short position on modern expansionary monetary policies. Indeed, Bitcoin's value should rise if expansionary monetary policies are maintained, amounting to a tool to short these policies, which should be considered in future attempts to value Bitcoin. Originality/value The author adds a new layer to the ongoing thought process by arguing of a function played by Bitcoin unaccounted for thus far by the literature. Additionally, the author describes the features and mechanisms, allowing Bitcoin to play that role.","[Morillon, Thibaut] Elon Univ, Dept Finance, Elon, NC 27244 USA","Elon University","Morillon, T (corresponding author), Elon Univ, Dept Finance, Elon, NC 27244 USA.","tmorillon@elon.edu","","Morillon, Thibaut/0000-0001-6025-6989","","","","","57","1","1","2","7","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1086-7376","1755-6791","","STUD ECON FINANC","Stud.

We employ connectedness measures based on the daily realised volatility of Bitcoin prices, for which the results reveal that Coinbase is the clear leader of the market, while Binance ranks surprisingly weak. The positions of specific exchanges within the network of connectedness seem to be driven by these exchanges' own characteristics, from which trading in USD rather than USDT (Tether) stands out. Our findings suggest that safer asset withdrawal matters more to the volatility connectedness among Bitcoin exchanges than does trading volume.","[Ji, Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Ji, Qiang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Bouri, Elie] Holy Spirit Univ Kaslik, Jounieh, Lebanon; [Kristoufek, Ladislav] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic; [Lucey, Brian] Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Business Sch, Dublin 2, Ireland","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Charles University Prague; Trinity College Dublin","Kristoufek, L (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic.","ladislav.kristoufek@fsv.cuni.cz","Ji, Qiang/AAA-4001-2020; Bouri, Elie/N-1368-2015; Ji, Qiang/AAY-1986-2021; lucey, brian/AAY-3885-2021; Bouri, Elie/ABC-4197-2020; Kristoufek, Ladislav/GOV-5386-2022","Ji, Qiang/0000-0002-3502-5254; Bouri, Elie/0000-0003-2628-5027; lucey, brian/0000-0002-4052-8235; Bouri, Elie/0000-0003-2628-5027; Kristoufek, Ladislav/0000-0003-4843-9373","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71974181, 71774152, 91546109]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y7 x 0231505]; Charles University PRIMUS program [PRIMUS/19/HUM/17]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Charles University PRIMUS program","The first author acknowledges the supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71974181, No. 71774152, No. 91546109, and Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant: Y7 x 0231505).

It employs the bootstrap full- and sub-sample rolling-window Granger causality tests to investigate the mutual causal influence between global economic policy uncertainty and Bitcoin returns. It finds that global economic policy uncertainty has both positive and negative causal impacts on Bitcoin returns, suggesting that Bitcoin cannot always be viewed as a new basket for eggs since it can not always be considered to hedge policy uncertainty. The paper finds a positive reverse causal impact of Bitcoin returns on global economic policy uncertainty, indicating that the Bitcoin market contains useful information to forecast global economic policy uncertainty. Additional analyses suggest that global economic policy uncertainty also contains valuable information to improve the prediction of returns and volatility in the Bitcoin market. Under the recent global trade tensions and complex economic environment, these analyses imply that investors and countries can exploit the Bitcoin market to optimize their investment.","[Qin, Meng] Natl Acad Governance, Grad Acad, Party Sch, Cent Comm Communist Party China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Su, Chi-Wei] Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Tao, Ran] Qingdao Municipal Ctr Dis Control & Preventat, Qingdao, Peoples R China","Qingdao University","Su, CW (corresponding author), 308 Ningxa Rd, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.","cwsu7137@gmail.com","Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021","","","","","","76","48","48","5","31","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0264-9993","1873-6122","","ECON MODEL","Econ.

Based on such considerations, this article aims to provide an overview of this cryptocurrency, from the perspective of conducting a systematic review of the literature dedicated to the economic and environmental impact of Bitcoin. Using peer-reviewed articles collected from academic databases, we aimed at synthesizing and critically evaluating the points of view in the scientific literature regarding the doctrinal source of the emergence of Bitcoin, the identity of this cryptocurrency from an economic point of view, following its implications on the economic and social environment. Subsequently, this research offers the opportunity of evaluating the level of knowledge considering the impact of Bitcoin mining process on the environment from the perspective of the energy consumption and CO2 emissions, in order to finally analyze Bitcoin regulation and identify possible solutions to reduce the negative impact on the environment and beyond. The findings suggest that, despite high energy consumption and adverse environmental impact, Bitcoin continues to be an instrument used in the economic environment for a variety of purposes. Moreover, the trend of regulating it in various countries shows that the use of Bitcoin is beginning to gain some legitimacy, despite criticism against this cryptocurrency.","[Badea, Liana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Econ Doctrines & Commun, Bucharest 010734, Romania; [Mungiu-Pupazan, Mariana Claudia] Constantin Brancusi Univ Targu Jiu, Dept Management & Business Adm, Targu Jiu 210191, Romania","Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Constantin Brancusi University","Badea, L (corresponding author), Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Econ Doctrines & Commun, Bucharest 010734, Romania.","liana.badea@economie.ase.ro","MUNGIU-PUPĂZAN, MARIANA-CLAUDIA/ABD-7703-2022; Badea, Liana/AAW-6174-2020","MUNGIU-PUPĂZAN, MARIANA-CLAUDIA/0000-0002-4681-913X; Badea, Liana/0000-0002-4482-2570","","","","","95","7","7","18","101","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2021","9","","","","","","48091","48104","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3068636","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3068636","","","14","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","RI8SU","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000637176600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Therefore, we use trading volume as a proxy for the market trading time and show that the first half-hour positively predicts the last half-hour return. We find that the first trading sessions with the highest volume or volatility are associated with the greatest predictability for intraday time series momentum. We also show that intraday momentum-based trading yields substantial economic gains in terms of market timing and asset allocation, especially in periods of a market downturn in Bitcoin. Consistent with the finding in foreign exchange markets, our results also show that the Bitcoin intraday momentum is driven by liquidity provision rather than late-informed trading.","[Shen, Dehua; Wang, Pengfei] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Urquhart, Andrew] Univ Reading, ICMA Ctr, Henley Business Sch, Reading, Berks, England","Tianjin University; University of Reading","Wang, PF (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China.","pengfeiwang@tju.edu.cn","","URQUHART, ANDREW/0000-0001-8834-4243","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71790594, 72071141]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","We thank MichaelGoldstein (the Editor), SriniKrishnamurthy (the Editor) and two anonymous referees for their invaluable and insightful suggestions that improved this paper substantially.

Since the introduction of Bitcoin futures coincided with this market crash, it is said that the new financial instrument might have caused the market crash. The literature states that the futures enabled investors to easily take a short position and hypothesizes that the selling pressure from futures could have potentially crashed the Bitcoin market. To evaluate this assumption, we investigate the empirical relationship between futures trading and the Bitcoin price by using high-frequency data. We find that Bitcoin futures trading was not significantly related to the returns on Bitcoin futures and spot returns. Therefore, we conclude that Bitcoin futures did not lead to the crash of the Bitcoin market at the end of 2017.","[Hattori, Takahiro] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Publ Policy, Tokyo, Japan; [Ishida, Ryo] Minist Finance Japan, Policy Res Inst, Chiyoda Ku, 3-1-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo, Japan","University of Tokyo","Hattori, T (corresponding author), 7-3-1 Hongo,Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan.","hattori0819@gmail.com","","","","","","","18","7","7","2","14","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1062-9408","1879-0860","","N AM J ECON FINANC","N.

And yet, most studies have thus far ignored that Bitcoin miners cycle through a growing amount of short-lived hardware that could exacerbate the growth in global electronic waste. E-waste represents a growing threat to our environment, from toxic chemicals and heavy metals leaching into soils, to air and water pollutions caused by improper recycling. Here we present a methodology to estimate Bitcoin's e-waste and find that it adds up to 30.7 metric kilotons annually, per May 2021. This number is comparable to the amount of small IT and telecommunication equipment waste produced by a country like the Netherlands. At peak Bitcoin price levels seen early in 2021, the annual amount of e-waste may grow beyond 64.4 metric kilotons in the midterm, which highlights the dynamic trend if the Bitcoin price rises further. Moreover, the demand for mining hardware already today disrupts the global semiconductor supply chain. The strategies we present may help to mitigate Bitcoin's growing e-waste problem.","[de Vries, Alex] Digiconomist, Almere, Netherlands; [de Vries, Alex] De Nederlandsche Bank, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Stoll, Christian] MIT, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Stoll, Christian] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Ctr Energy Markets, TUM Sch Management, Munich, Germany","European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Technical University of Munich","de Vries, A (corresponding author), De Nederlandsche Bank NV, Amsterdam, Noord Holland, Netherlands.","alex@digiconomist.net","de Vries, Alex/HCI-0924-2022; Stoll, Christian/AAX-8868-2021","de Vries, Alex/0000-0002-9594-1289; Stoll, Christian/0000-0001-5169-029X","","","","","48","18","18","1","23","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0921-3449","1879-0658","","RESOUR CONSERV RECY","Resour.

CryptoCompare now streams this index every 15 seconds, under the ticker BVIN. Alexander and Imeraj are the first to investigate the bitcoin va riance risk premiums and the behavior of the term structure of fair- value variance swap rates. The authors collect price data on bitcoin derivatives traded on the Deribit exchange via its application programming interface. They construct a family of indexes for different maturities using the same methodology used by CBOE's equity volatility index, the VIX. They describe the methodology, noting that it accounts for information in volatility skews but assumes no jumps in prices. They also compare the indexes with those created with an alternative technique that does not rely on the no-jump assumption.

We therefore present some foundational ideas in the economics of exhaustible resources and examine their relevance to Bitcoin. There are several useful similarities but also some key differences, chiefly with respect to how miners manage inventories, or their inventory policy. Therefore, to highlight this aspect, we use a simple model for any physical natural resource and introduce sensitivity to a capital-to-energy ratio. The resulting policy for Bitcoin miner over a halving cycle is not unlike a traditional miner in that optimal inventories are determined by optimal capital investments over the entire duration of the cycle.","[Goorha, Prateek] Bridgewater State Univ, Bridgewater, MA 02324 USA","Massachusetts System of Public Higher Education; Bridgewater State College","Goorha, P (corresponding author), Bridgewater State Univ, Bridgewater, MA 02324 USA.","goorha@sent.com","","","","","","","11","0","0","1","1","BRITISH BLOCKCHAIN ASSOC","LONDON","KEMP HOUSE 152-160 CITY RD, LONDON, EC1V 2NX, ENGLAND","","2516-3957","","J BRIT BLOCKCHAIN AS","J.

This study examines Bitcoin across its history using a time-series structural break analysis to differentiate five distinct periods within Bitcoin's evolution. Data obtained includes the open-high-low-close and volume Bitcoin trading data by the minute from October 15, 2010 until January 1, 2020. Within each period, we examine Bitcoin's closing price in relation to an established set of economic indicators that encompass economic health, long-term economic stability, monetary policy, and investor sentiment.

Although several heuristics have been used to break the anonymity, new approaches are proposed to enhance its anonymity at the same time. One of them is the mixing service. Unfortunately, mixing services have been abused to facilitate criminal activities, e.g., money laundering. As such, there is an urgent need to systematically understand Bitcoin mixing services. In this paper, we take the first step to understand state-of-the-art Bitcoin mixing services. Specifically, we propose a generic abstraction model for mixing services and observe that there are two mixing mechanisms in the wild, i.e. swapping and obfuscating. Based on this model, we conduct a transaction-based analysis and successfully reveal the mixing mechanisms of four representative services. Besides, we propose a method to identify mixing transactions that leverage the obfuscating mechanism. The proposed approach is able to identify over 92% of the mixing transactions. Based on identified transactions, we then estimate the profit of mixing services and provide a case study of tracing the money flow of stolen Bitcoins.","[Wu, Lei; Hu, Yufeng; Zhou, Yajin; Zhang, Fan; Ren, Kui] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Haoyu] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Luo, Xiapu] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhi] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Zhejiang University; Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University","Zhou, YJ (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.","yajin_zhou@zju.edu.cn","","","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2020QNA5019, 2019QNA5016]; Leading Innovative and Entrepreneur Team Introduction Program of Zhejiang [2018R01005]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62072046]; Hong Kong RGC Projects [152193/19E, 152223/20E]","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Leading Innovative and Entrepreneur Team Introduction Program of Zhejiang; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hong Kong RGC Projects","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments. that helped improve the presentation of this paper.

We start by estimating the response of bitcoin trading in terms of volume and volatility to economic surprises. Following this, we extend our framework by applying a Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity model to get an indication of the volatility reaction of national bitcoin activities to economic surprise shocks. Our results show that local and global shocks affect local bitcoin activities and trading volatilities, confirming that economic events affect bitcoin markets. We argue that increased trading activity, coupled with a price reaction, indicates that bitcoin might be considered a hedge or safe haven asset against economic uncertainty. We find evidence that bitcoin is treated as a speculative asset against negative economic policy uncertainty shocks in Canada pre-Covid-19. These results change during the Covid-19 pandemic, leading to a significant structural break. Here, we find indications that bitcoin might be treated as a safe-haven asset in New Zealand and Australia. This shows that bitcoin behaves differently depending on the studied country, underlining the importance of country-level studies. It also shows that bitcoin is a new asset that is evolving rapidly and that the period in which it is studied is important.","[Wuestenfeld, Jan] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany; [Geldner, Teo] Univ Greifswald, Friedrich Loeffler Str 70, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany","Ruhr University Bochum; Ernst Moritz Arndt Universitat Greifswald","Geldner, T (corresponding author), Univ Greifswald, Friedrich Loeffler Str 70, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.","jan.wuestenfeld@rub.de; teo.geldner@uni-greifswald.de","","","","","","","49","2","2","1","9","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1062-9408","1879-0860","","N AM J ECON FINANC","N.

This study suggests that Bitcoin, due to its exotic nature, unwavering appeal, and unknown set of drivers, could act as a diversifier in normal market conditions, and it might also have some borderline hedge to safe haven properties. The results further suggest that while Bitcoin may be a potential diversifier for a risk-seeking investor, the risk-averse investor must exercise caution by limiting their exposure to Bitcoin in their portfolios, as unnecessary exposure may increase the probability of losses in extreme market conditions.","[Bakry, Walid] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2751, Australia; [Rashid, Audil; Al-Mohamad, Somar; El-Kanj, Nasser] Amer Univ Middle East, Coll Business Adm, Eqaila 54200, Kuwait; [Bakry, Walid] Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia","Western Sydney University; American University of Middle East","Bakry, W (corresponding author), Western Sydney Univ, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2751, Australia.;Bakry, W (corresponding author), Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.","wbakry@westernsydney.edu.au; audil.rashid@aum.edu.kw; somar.al-mohamad@aum.edu.kw; Nasser.El-Kanj@aum.edu.kw","Rashid, Audil/AAY-3083-2021; Elkanj, Nasser/AAX-1442-2021; Bakry, Walid/AFG-0658-2022; Rashid, Audil/AID-3536-2022","Elkanj, Nasser/0000-0002-5440-3599; Bakry, Walid/0000-0002-6049-9662; Khaki, Audil/0000-0003-3168-8007","","","","","91","3","3","6","22","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

As Bitcoin is a public open ledger blockchain coin, it has its weaknesses in privacy and anonymity. In the recent decade numerous coins have been initiated as privacy coins, which try to tackle these weaknesses. This research compares mostly mature privacy coins to Bitcoin, and comparison is made from a price perspective. It seems that Bitcoin is leading privacy coins in price terms, and correlation is typically high and positive. From the earlier crypto market peak of 2017-18, only a very small number of coins are showing positive returns in 2021. It is typical that many privacy coins have lost substantial amounts of their value (ranging 80-90%) or that they do not exist anymore at all. Only Horizen and Monero have shown long-term sustainability in their value; however, their price changes follow that of Bitcoin very closely. The role of privacy coins in the future remains as an open issue.","[Hilmola, Olli-Pekka] LUT Univ, Kouvola Unit, Tykkitie 1, FIN-45100 Kouvola, Finland; [Hilmola, Olli-Pekka] Tallinn Univ Technol Taltech, Estonian Maritime Acad, Kopli 101, EE-11712 Tallinn, Estonia","","Hilmola, OP (corresponding author), LUT Univ, Kouvola Unit, Tykkitie 1, FIN-45100 Kouvola, Finland.;Hilmola, OP (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ Technol Taltech, Estonian Maritime Acad, Kopli 101, EE-11712 Tallinn, Estonia.","olli-pekka.hilmola@lut.fi","","Hilmola, Olli-Pekka/0000-0002-0622-5791","","","","","36","0","0","2","10","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

Nevertheless, the trading values of cryptocurrency compared to real money are very uncertain and can change dramatically. This article is aimed to assess the uncertainty or volatility of cryptocurrencies, mostly on Bitcoin. In the digital currencies market, Bitcoin is a widely accepted currency. Other digital currencies of the market may influence Bitcoin. For example, Ethereum, Litecoin, Zcash, Monero, Dash and Ripple have a positive impact on Bitcoin. Previous research only focuses on Bitcoin and other markets such as stock markets, energy markets, and exchange rates. However, here we focus on interlinkages and volatility dynamics within cryptocurrency markets by applying some econometrics models. In this article, we have shown that the relationship between Bitcoin and other currencies can be modelled in the ARCH, GARCH, VAR and MGARCH framework. Forecast values of the GARCH (3,3) model are given very close to the original data. VAR stability result shows that the model is stable. Using the CCC, VCC, and DCC of the MGARCH model on daily returns from 1st January 2017 to 15th March 2019, we found significant volatility and strong correlations between the variables.","[Hossain, Md Jamal; Ismail, Mohd Tahir] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, Usm Pulau Pinang 11800, Malaysia; [Hossain, Md Jamal] Noakhali Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Appl Math, Noakhali 3814, Bangladesh","Universiti Sains Malaysia; Noakhali Science & Technology University (NSTU)","Hossain, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, Usm Pulau Pinang 11800, Malaysia.;Hossain, MJ (corresponding author), Noakhali Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Appl Math, Noakhali 3814, Bangladesh.","z_math_du@yahoo.com","Ismail, Mohd Tahir/A-7280-2018","Ismail, Mohd Tahir/0000-0003-2747-054X","","","","","55","1","1","8","19","PENERBIT UNIV SAINS MALAYSIA","PULAU PINANG","PENERBIT UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA, PULAU PINANG, PINANG 11800, MALAYSIA","1823-4992","2180-4192","","ASIAN ACAD MANAG J A","Asian Acad.

Even if right now the portfolio of digital assets is considerable in size, the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, exploited its pioneer advantage and managed to remain at the center of attention both for the media and investors. During 2020, one of the most chaotic years, Bitcoin boomed in November 2020 almost doubling since the end of 2019. This boom is the result of a combination of factors, such as the fear of missing out translated into a chain reaction of public and private companies to consider Bitcoin a safe reserve asset, a hedging method against inflation, which represents a substitute for traditional hedging instruments, the infrastructure developed around it over the years, and lastly the hype created by influential figures through news and social media platforms. There have been many public figures that exhibited interest in cryptocurrencies through platforms such as Twitter, for instance Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Kanye West, Hugh Laurie, Mike Tyson and Gwyneth Paltrow are just some in a long list of celebrities that backed Bitcoin. This paper aims to analyze the impact that twitter posts have upon the evolution of Bitcoin, coupled with Tesla's investment and recent statement of introducing Bitcoin as a method of payment in the near future. Our research tries to determine if the news and social media posts, such as tweets have an influence upon Bitcoin's volatility and fluctuations.","[Mironeanu, Alexandra; Irimia, Beatrice; Sandulescu, Valentina; Teodoroiu, Casiana] Int Master Business Adm, Bucharest, Romania","","Mironeanu, A (corresponding author), Int Master Business Adm, Bucharest, Romania.","alexandra.miroaneanu@gmail.com; beatriceirimia123@yahoo.com; valentina.marlene@gmail.com; teodoroiu.casiana@yahoo.com","","","","","","","23","0","0","1","7","SCIENDO","WARSAW","BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND","2502-0226","2558-9652","","P INT CONF BUS EXCEL","Proc.

WE found that that out of the tree classical candlesticks pattern only Engulfing has been fertile in predicting Bitcoin's price trends shifts. The classical Engulfing pattern generated Profit Factor (PF) of 3.54 and $38,349 Net Profit (NP). We also found that using a strength proxy of 0.9% may improve the classical pattern results. The classical Harami formation failed to produce positive trading results and therefore does not fit Bitcoin trading platforms. On the other hand, a reversed Harami was proven to be a fertile Bitcoin trading strategy. Our research also finds that classical four bars Kicker signals seldom appears and therefore cannot help Bitcoin traders. On the other hand, a reversed Kicker pattern has found to be a winning strategy with relatively low risk. This strategy fits particularly long positions with 74.36% Percent of Profitable (PP) trades and 6.92 PF.

Second, we resort to a representative agent modelling strategy within a money-in-the-utility function framework capturing the role of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. We show that the specific monetary features of Bitcoin, its constant nominal stock and divisibility down to eight decimal places, account for a strong possibility of speculative hyperdeflationary paths.

Previous research, mostly empirical, focused on statistical tests in order to detect a bubble behavior at some point in time. Few exceptions suggested specific time series models capable to describe such phenomena. We contribute this stream of literature by considering a continuous time stochastic model for Bitcoin dynamics, depending on a market attention factor, which is proven to boost in a bubble under suitable conditions. Here, we define a bubble following the theory of mathematical bubbles introduced by Philip E. Protter and coauthors. Specifically, we prove that the presence of a bubble is related to the correlation between the market attention factor on Bitcoin and Bitcoin returns being above a threshold, i.e. when marked attention affects Bitcoin prices and converse, creating a vicious loop. This phenomenon has been labelled market exuberance by Robert J. Shiller, recipient of the 2013 Nobel prize in Economic Sciences. The model is fitted on historical data of Bitcoin prices, by considering either the total trading volume or the Google Search Volume Index as proxies for the attention measure. According to our numerical results, a bubble effect is evidenced in the early years of Bitcoin introduction, namely 2012-2013, as well as in the recent race of 2017.","[Cretarola, Alessandra] Univ Perugia, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Via Luigi Vanvitelli 1, I-06123 Perugia, Italy; [Figa-Talamanca, Gianna] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via Alessandro Pascoli, I-06123 Perugia, Italy","University of Perugia; University of Perugia","Figa-Talamanca, G (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via Alessandro Pascoli, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.","alessandra.cretarola@unipg.it; gianna.figatalamanca@unipg.it","Cretarola, Alessandra/L-1925-2015","Cretarola, Alessandra/0000-0003-1324-9342","","","","","42","23","23","2","17","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0254-5330","1572-9338","","ANN OPER RES","Ann.

Darknet only allow cryptocurrencies as the payment methods, making it hard for law enforcement to trace those illicit transactions. In this paper, we present a method to identify vendors' bitcoin addresses by matching vendors' feedback reviews with bitcoin transactions in the public ledger. The problem is decomposed into two steps in formulation. In Step 1, we solve a bounding box matching between the set of feedback reviews and bitcoin transactions. In Step 2, we find the bitcoin addresses with a maximum coverage of the reviews. Baseline algorithm for Step 1 runs in quadratic time thus we develop a K-D tree to accelerate the computing. Problem in Step 2 is NP-hard thus we develop a greedy algorithm with an approximation ratio of (1 - 1/epsilon) based on the submodular property of the objective function. We further propose a cost-effective algorithm to accelerate both steps effectively. Comprehensive experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.","[Chen, Xucan; Wu, Yubao] Georgia State Univ, Comp Sci, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Cheng, Wei] NEC Labs Amer Inc, Princeton, NJ USA; [Ouellet, Marie; Maimon, David] Georgia State Univ, Criminal Justice & Criminol, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Li, Yuan] North China Univ Technol, Comp Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; NEC Corporation; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; North China University of Technology","Chen, XC (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Comp Sci, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.","xchen41@student.gsu.edu; weicheng@nec-labs.com; mouellet@gsu.edu; neu_liyuan@126.com; Dmaimon@gsu.edu; ywu28@gsu.edu","","","NSF [2030636, 2039949]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work is partially supported by the DHS/CINA project entitled Open Source Intelligence in Online Stolen Data Markets: Assessment of Network Disruption Strategies, and the NSF awards 2030636 and 2039949.","","31","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2375-9232","","978-1-6654-2427-1","INT CONF DAT MIN WOR","","","2021","","","","","","","788","797","","10.1109/ICDMW53433.2021.00102","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW53433.2021.00102","","","10","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS9CY","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000779306300095","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In particular, as the bitcoin bubble grows, the relationship between trading volume and premium becomes clearer. This is consistent with the speculative bubble literature, which shows that the size of a bubble is positively related to trading volume. Our findings imply that fundamental uncertainty generates more dispersion in heterogeneous beliefs among investors and leads to high trading and to speculative bubbles.","[Eom, Yunsung] Hansung Univ, Div Management, 116 Samseongyoro 16 Gil, Seoul 02876, South Korea","Hansung University","Eom, Y (corresponding author), Hansung Univ, Div Management, 116 Samseongyoro 16 Gil, Seoul 02876, South Korea.","yseom@hansung.ac.kr","","","Hansung University","Hansung University","This research was financially supported by Hansung University.

Many previous studies have explored the security of Bitcoin from the perspective of blockchain mining. Especially on the double-spending attacks (DSA), some state-of-the-art studies have proposed various analytical models, aiming to understand the insights behind the double-spending attacks. However, we believe that advanced versions of DSA can be developed to create new threats for the Bitcoin ecosystem. To this end, this paper mainly presents a new type of double-spending attack named Adaptive DSA in the context of the Bitcoin blockchain, and discloses the associated insights. In our analytical model, the double-spending attack is converted into a Markov Decision Process. We then exploit the Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) approach to obtain the optimal attack strategies towards Adaptive DSA. Through the proposed analytical model and the disclosed insights behind Adaptive DSA, we aim to alert the Bitcoin ecosystem that the threat of double-spending attacks is still at a dangerous level.","[Zheng, Jian; Huang, Huawei; Li, Canlin; Zheng, Zibin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Guo, Song] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Sun Yat Sen University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University","Huang, HW (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.","huanghw28@mail.sysu.edu.cn; song.guo@polyu.edu.hk","Guo, Song/AAZ-4542-2020; Zheng, Zibin/HCH-2408-2022; Zheng, Zibin/E-3024-2014","Guo, Song/0000-0001-9831-2202; Zheng, Zibin/0000-0002-7878-4330; Zheng, Zibin/0000-0002-7878-4330","Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province [2019B020214006]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62032025, 61902445]; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2019A1515011798]","Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation","This work described in this paper was supported by the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (No.2019B020214006), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.62032025, No.61902445), and the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (No.2019A1515011798).","","14","0","0","0","5","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1548-615X","","978-1-6654-1494-4","INT WORKSH QUAL SERV","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/IWQOS52092.2021.9521306","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IWQOS52092.2021.9521306","","","6","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BS3CA","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000709411600046","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this paper, we focus on the relationships between the Bitcoin spot and futures. Specifically, we adopt the vector autoregression-dynamic correlation coefficient-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (VAR-DCC-GARCH) model and vector autoregression-Baba, Engle, Kraft, and Kroner-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (VAR-BEKK-GARCH) models and calculate the hedging effectiveness (HE) value to investigate the dynamic correlation and volatility spillover and assess the risk reduction of the Bitcoin futures to spot. The empirical results show that the Bitcoin spot and futures markets are highly connected; second, there exists a bi-directional volatility spillover between the spot and futures market; third, the HE value is equal to 0.6446, which indicates that Bitcoin futures can indeed hedge the risks in the Bitcoin spot market. Furthermore, we update the data to the post-Covid-19 period to do the robustness checks. The results do not change our conclusion that Bitcoin futures can hedge the risks in the Bitcoin spot market, and besides, the post-Covid-19 results indicate that the hedging ability of Bitcoin futures increased. Finally, we test whether the gold futures can be used as a Bitcoin spot market hedge, and we further control other cryptocurrencies to illustrate the hedging ability of the Bitcoin futures to the Bitcoin spot. Overall, the empirical results in this paper will surely benefit the related investors in the Bitcoin market.","[Zhang, Yinpeng] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Econ, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Panpan] Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yingying] Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China","Shenzhen University; Beijing Technology & Business University; University of Science & Technology Beijing","Xu, YY (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.","yingxu21@ustb.edu.cn","","","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China [FRF-BR-20-04B, 06320048]","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China [grant numbers FRF-BR-20-04B, 06320048].","","62","2","2","10","18","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","2296-2565","","FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH","Front.

The need for these tools dates back to the market crash of 1987, when investors needed better ways to protect their portfolios through option insurance. These tools provide greater flexibility to trade and hedge volatile swings in Bitcoin prices effectively. The violation of constant volatility and the log-normality assumption of the Black-Scholes option pricing model led to the discovery of the volatility smile, smirk, or skew in options markets. These stylized facts; that is, the volatility smile and implied volatilities implied by the option prices, are well documented in the option literature for almost all financial markets. These are expected to be true for Bitcoin options as well. The data sets for the study are based on short-dated Bitcoin options (14-day maturity) of two time periods traded on Deribit Bitcoin Futures and Options Exchange, a Netherlands-based cryptocurrency derivative exchange. The estimated results are compared with benchmark Black-Scholes implied volatility values for accuracy and efficiency analysis. This study has two aims: (1) to provide insights into the volatility smile in Bitcoin options and (2) to estimate the implied volatility of Bitcoin options through numerical approximation techniques, specifically the Newton Raphson and Bisection methods. The experimental results show that Bitcoin options belong to the commodity class of assets based on the presence of a volatility forward skew in Bitcoin option data. Moreover, the Newton Raphson and Bisection methods are effective in estimating the implied volatility of Bitcoin options. However, the Newton Raphson forecasting technique converges faster than does the Bisection method.","[Zulfiqar, Noshaba; Gulzar, Saqib] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Wah Campus, Wah Cantt, Pakistan","COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI)","Zulfiqar, N (corresponding author), COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Wah Campus, Wah Cantt, Pakistan.","noshaba.khann@gmail.com","Zulfiqar, Noshaba/GVS-3916-2022","Zulfiqar, Noshaba/0000-0001-5795-7215","","","","","133","1","1","5","16","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","2199-4730","","FINANC INNOV","Financ.

However, relatively little is known about cryptocurrencies, their price behaviour, how quickly they incorporate new information and their corresponding market efficiency. To extend the current literature in this area, we develop four smart electronic Bitcoin markets populated with different types of traders using a special adaptive form of the Strongly Typed Genetic Programming (STGP)-based learning algorithm. We apply the STGP technique to historical data of Bitcoin at the one-minute and five-minute frequencies to investigate the formation of Bitcoin market dynamics and market efficiency. Through a plethora of robust testing procedures, we find that both Bitcoin markets populated by high-frequency traders (HFTs) are efficient at the one-minute frequency but inefficient at the five-minute frequency. This finding supports the argument that at the one-minute frequency investors are able to incorporate new information in a fast and rationale manner and not suffer from the noise associated with the five-minute frequency. We also contribute to the e-commerce literature by demonstrating that zero-intelligence traders cannot reach market efficiency, therefore providing evidence against the hypothesis of Hayek (1945; 1968). One practical implication of this study is that we demonstrate that e-commerce practitioners can apply artificial intelligence tools such as STGP to conduct behaviour-based market profiling.","[Manahov, Viktor] Univ York, Dept Management, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Urquhart, Andrew] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, ICMA Ctr, Reading, Berks, England","University of York - UK; University of Reading","Urquhart, A (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, ICMA Ctr, Reading, Berks, England.","viktor.manahov@york.ac.uk; a.j.urquhart@icmacentre.ac.uk","","URQUHART, ANDREW/0000-0001-8834-4243","","","","","127","8","8","3","8","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1057-5219","1873-8079","","INT REV FINANC ANAL","Int.

In addition, we present evidence that investors' attention is the main source of volatility.

The main contribution is to use these data analytics techniques with great caution in the parameterization, instead of classical parametric modelings (AR), to disentangle the non-stationary behavior of the data. As soon as Bitcoin is also used for diversification in portfolios, we need to investigate its interactions with stocks, bonds, foreign exchange, and commodities.

Although Bitcoin continues to be the most widely used cryptocurrency, its increased attractiveness to investors has led to the emergence of Altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin). Employing an event study approach using the daily price series for the sample period from 1 January 2018 to 17 July 2020, the study aims to determine the impact of Covid-19 on the value of both Bitcoin and Altcoins. The evidence shows that the abnormal returns of Bitcoin and Altcoins around Covid-19 dates are negative and Altcoins are more adversely affected by the pandemic than Bitcoin. The study also documents that most altcoins rely on the same block chain technology aiming to complement or improve certain Bitcoin characteristics, and the high correlation between Bitcoin and Altcoins are likely to fail cross-currency hedging strategies during the pandemic crisis.","[Abraham, Mathew] Whitireia Business Sch, Finance, Wellington, New Zealand","","Abraham, M (corresponding author), Whitireia Business Sch, Finance, Wellington, New Zealand.","matthew.abraham@whitireia.ac.nz","","","","","","","14","0","0","0","3","PORTHOLOGOS PRESS","GHANA","NILE VALLEY MULTIVERSITY, 333 NHAWINEI AVE, BONO EAST, TECHIMAN, GHANA, SOUTH AFRICA","2042-1478","2410-4906","","AFR REV ECON FINANC","Afr.

We analyze the dependability of the Bitcoin system subject to the Eclipse attack. A continuous-time Markov chain-based method is suggested to model the system behavior under the Eclipse attack and further quantify the dependability of the Bitcoin system. The effects of several model parameters (related to the miner's habits in system protection, restart, and mining frequency) on the system dependability are demonstrated through numerical examples.

A number of attacks against Bitcoin have been discovered over the past years, including the Eclipse and EREBUS Attacks. In this paper, we present a new attack against Bitcoin's P2P networking, dubbed ConMan because it leverages connection manipulation. ConMan achieves the same effect as the Eclipse and EREBUS Attacks in isolating a target (i.e., victim) node from the rest of the Bitcoin network. However, ConMan is different from these attacks because it is an active and deterministic attack, and is more effective and efficient. We validate ConMan through proof-of-concept exploitation in an environment that is coupled with real-world Bitcoin node functions. Experimental results show that ConMan only needs a few minutes to fully control the peer connections of a target node, which is in sharp contrast to the tens of days that are needed by the Eclipse and EREBUS Attacks. Further, we propose several countermeasures against ConMan. Some of them would be effective but incompatible with the design principles of Bitcoin, while the anomaly detection approach is positively achievable. We disclosed ConMan to the Bitcoin Core team and received their feedback, which confirms ConMan and the proposed countermeasures.","[Fan, Wenjun] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Dept Commun & Networking, Sch Adv Technol, Suzhou 215123, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chang, Sang-Yoon; Zhou, Xiaobo; Xu, Shouhuai] Univ Colorado, Dept Comp Sci, Coll Engn & Appl Sci, Colorado Springs, CO 80918 USA","Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado at Colorado Springs","Fan, WJ (corresponding author), Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Dept Commun & Networking, Sch Adv Technol, Suzhou 215123, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.","Wenjun.Fan@xjtlu.edu.cn; schang2@uccs.edu; xzhou@uccs.edu; sxu@uccs.edu","","","NSF [2122631, 1814825]; Colorado State Bill [18-086]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Colorado State Bill","This work was supported in part by NSF Grant #2122631 (#1814825) and by Colorado State Bill 18-086.","","36","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2474-025X","","978-1-6654-4496-5","IEEE CONF COMM NETW","","","2021","","","","","","","101","109","","10.1109/CNS53000.2021.9705018","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CNS53000.2021.9705018","","","9","Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BT0EU","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000786954200018","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A full node on Bitcoin network has to store over 320GB of data as of March 9, 2021. According to the growth rate of Bitcoin transactions, it is estimated that the size of Bitcoin data on a full node will exceed 400GB within two years. The storage problem makes it difficult for common users to easily store all of Bitcoin data, which weakens the decentralization capability of Bitcoin network. In this work, we propose an efficient storage scheme (ESS) based on the distribution characteristics of the unspent transaction outputs in Bitcoin system. It can prune the storage of the transactions for those low query frequency blocks. When a new block is generated, a node using ESS scheme can quickly verify most of the transaction inputs. Only a small amount of transaction outputs of older blocks need to be retrieved from the full node for payment verification. Experimental results demonstrated that our scheme can reduce the size of a normal node in current Bitcoin system by about 85% at a low communication cost.","[Wang, Xiaoqing; Wang, Chunping; Zhou, Kun; Cheng, Hongbing] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Hangzhou, Peoples R China","Zhejiang University of Technology","Cheng, HB (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ Technol, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.","2111912087@zjut.edu.cn; Wangcp@zjut.edu.cn; 2112012163@zjut.edu.cn; chenghb@zjut.edu.cn","","","National Nature Science Foundation of China [62072407, 61402413]; Nature Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LY19F020023]","National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Nature Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province)","This work was supported in part by the National Nature Science Foundation of China under Grant 62072407 and Grant 61402413,in part by the Nature Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province under Grant LY19F020023.","","25","0","0","1","1","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","2324-898X","","978-1-6654-1658-0","IEEE INT CONF TRUST","","","2021","","","","","","","911","918","","10.1109/TrustCom53373.2021.00128","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom53373.2021.00128","","","8","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BT3DY","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000817855700110","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Recently, numerous researches on prediction of financial indices including Bitcoin based on machine learning techniques have been developed. However, little studies pay attention to the strategy of manipulating original distribution to obtain better performances. Because the return data of Bitcoin prices are highly concentrated near zero, small changes of values in the components can cause different results. Based on this characteristic, we propose flattening distribution strategy (FDS) based on the copula theory as a strategy of the manipulating distribution of components artificially to improve the prediction of Bitcoin price return. We consider multilayer perceptron (MLP), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) to assess the performances of FDS. Finally, we find that the proposed algorithms based on FDS improve significantly the prediction accuracy of the return of Bitcoin price for each of the three architectures. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

For the 5% VaR, quantity variables, such as Bitcoin trading volume and monetary policy rate, were positively significant, but these effects were attenuated when new samples were added. The 5% VaR responds positively to the Internet search index and negatively to the fluctuation of returns on commodity variables and the Chinese stock market index. For the 1% VaR, variables related to the macroeconomy play a key role. The consumer sentiment index exerts a strong positive effect on the 1% VaR.

It is important to further develop our understanding of the inter-dynamics between this relatively youthful financial product and pricing sensitivities associated with corporate technological advancement. Several interesting results are presented. First, Bitcoin is identified as a volatility receiver instead of a transmitter across all of the time frequencies considered during periods of patent development. Secondly, Microsoft, Mastercard, Intel and Visa contribute the largest volatility spillovers to the Bitcoin market due to patent development. Finally, for most of the companies considered, the calculated spillover effects towards Bitcoin markets are found to increase from the short-term to the long-term. These results suggest the existence of an avenue through which large corporations can influence cryptocurrency prices through their announcements of future technological intentions.

Some studies have indicated that Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)-based blind signatures are compatible with Bitcoin because they prevent the linking of sensitive information due to the untamability of Bitcoin. However, these approaches are not sufficiently flexible because blind signatures do not allow the signer to obtain any information. Here, we propose an ECDSA-based partially blind signature scheme.

In the Bitcoin network, the average clustering coefficient of nodes is very high, resulting in low message propagation efficiency. In addition, average node degree in the Bitcoin network is also considerably large, causing high message redundancy when nodes use the gossip protocol to broadcast messages. These may affect message propagation speed, hindering Bitcoin from being applied to scenarios of high transactional throughputs. To illustrate, we have collected single-hop propagation data of transactions of 366 blocks from Bitcoin Core. The analysis results show that transaction verification and network delay are two major causes of low transaction propagation efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel P2P network structure, called local clique network (LCN), for message broadcasting in the Bitcoin network. Specifically, to reduce transaction validation latency and message redundancy, in LCN local nodes (logically) form cliques, and only a few nodes in a clique broadcast messages to the other cliques, instead of each node sending messages to its neighboring nodes. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the results show that message redundancy is low in LCN, and message propagation speed increases significantly. Meanwhile, LCN exhibits excellent robustness when average node degree remains high in the Bitcoin network.","[Yan, Kailun] Shandong Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Technol, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jilian; Wu, Yongdong] Jinan Univ, Coll Cyber Secur, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Shandong University; Jinan University","Zhang, JL (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Coll Cyber Secur, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.","victory_yan@foxmail.com; zhangjilian@jnu.edu.cn; wuyd007@qq.com","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61932011, 62020106013, 61972177, 61877029]; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2019B1515120010]; Guangdong Key RD Plan 2020 [2020B0101090002]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; Guangdong Key RD Plan 2020","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61932011, 62020106013, 61972177 and 61877029), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (Grant No. 2019B1515120010) and Guangdong Key R&D Plan 2020 (No. 2020B0101090002).

Bitcoin mining is measured through Bitcoin hashrate, which represents the completion speed of the Bitcoin code. We also include three energy commodities, i.e. oil, coal, and gas in a multivariate model employing time-frequency wavelet extensions in the form of partial and multivariate models. Results of our study suggest that both oil and gas lead Bitcoin returns from mid 2014 till 2016 across 64- 128 days' period. Under the investment period of 64- 256, hashrate and Bitcoin returns share significant comovement in the presence of oil and natural gas however exhibit no comovement when the effect of coal market is considered. Our results of wavelet decomposition suggest that the magnitude of comovement ranging from short- to long-run is time varying. Finally, results of the causality on quantile test suggest that Bitcoin returns cause changes in Bitcoin hashrate mostly during median quantiles with an asymmetric pattern. Our work entail implications for investors in the Bitcoin and energy market and is also helpful in forecasting the pricing behavior of Bitcoin using the hashrate and vice versa.","[Rehman, Mobeen Ur] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Informetr Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Rehman, Mobeen Ur] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Rehman, Mobeen Ur] South Ural State Univ, 76 Lenin Prospekt, Chelyabinsk, Russia; [Kang, Sang Hoon] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Business Adm, Busan 609735, South Korea","Ton Duc Thang University; Ton Duc Thang University; South Ural State University; Pusan National University","Kang, SH (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Business Adm, Busan 609735, South Korea.","Mobeen@tdtu.edu.vn; sanghoonkang@pusan.ac.kr","Rehman, Mobeen Ur/B-4368-2017","Rehman, Mobeen Ur/0000-0002-8889-9051","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2020S1A5B8103268]","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This work was also supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2020S1A5B8103268).","","34","16","16","2","5","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1044-0283","1873-5665","","GLOB FINANC J","Glob.

Therefore, in this paper, the algorithm of machine learning is used to put forward the prediction method of Ransomware Family, so as to achieve the better effect of helping the attacked institutions to avoid being extorted effectively. In the traditional method, the judgment of Ransomware Family can only rely on human experience and subjective judgment, instead of accurate and batch analysis of Bitcoin transactions and prediction results. In this paper, a large number of known data sets of bitcoin's transaction features are used for analysis and modeling. First, we carried out descriptive statistical analysis to explore the differences between different Ransomware Families in bitcoin trading behavior. Next, we used a series of machine learning models to build the prediction model of Ransomware Family and conduct identification and classification, so as to help avoid financial losses from the Ransomware. Finally, we found that Ransomware family species were most significantly affected by year.

Bitcoin transactions make use of peer-to-peer network nodes without a third-party intermediary, and the transactions can be verified by the node. Although Bitcoin networks have exhibited high efficiency in the financial transaction systems, their payment transactions are vulnerable to several ransomware attacks. For that reason, investigators have been working on developing ransomware payment identification techniques for bitcoin transactions' networks to prevent such harmful cyberattacks. In this paper, we propose a high performance Bitcoin transaction predictive system that investigates the Bitcoin payment transactions to learn data patterns that can recognize and classify ransomware payments for heterogeneous bitcoin networks. Specifically, our system makes use of two supervised machine learning methods to learn the distinguishing patterns in Bitcoin payment transactions, namely, shallow neural networks (SNN) and optimizable decision trees (ODT). To validate the effectiveness of our solution approach, we evaluate our machine learning based predictive models on a recent Bitcoin transactions dataset in terms of classification accuracy as a key performance indicator and other key evaluation metrics such as the confusion matrix, positive predictive value, true positive rate, and the corresponding prediction errors. As a result, our superlative experimental result was registered to the model-based decision trees scoring 99.9% and 99.4% classification detection (two-class classifier) and accuracy (multiclass classifier), respectively. Hence, the obtained model accuracy results are superior as they surpassed many state-of-the-art models developed to identify ransomware payments in bitcoin transactions.","[Abu Al-Haija, Qasem] Univ Petra UoP, Fac Informat Technol, Dept Data Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Amman 1196, Jordan; [Alsulami, Abdulaziz A.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Dept Informat Syst, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia","King Abdulaziz University","Abu Al-Haija, Q (corresponding author), Univ Petra UoP, Fac Informat Technol, Dept Data Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Amman 1196, Jordan.","qasem.abualhalla@uop.edu.jo; aaalsulami10@kau.edu.sa","Alsulami, Abdulaziz/CAJ-3515-2022; Abu Al-Haija, Qasem/N-8164-2013","Abu Al-Haija, Qasem/0000-0003-2422-0297; Alsulami, Abdulaziz/0000-0003-2931-8744","","","","","38","9","9","1","6","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2079-9292","","ELECTRONICS-SWITZ","Electronics","SEP","2021","10","17","","","","","","","2113","10.3390/electronics10172113","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics10172113","","","17","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Physics","UN7KL","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000694190500001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Based on this premise, to have a well-functioning transaction analysis algorithm requires coin mixing detection with a high recall to ensure accuracy. Most practical coin mixing algorithms do not change the Bitcoin protocol. Therefore, the transactions they generate are not fundamentally different from regular transactions. Existing coin mixing detection methods are commonly rule-based that can only identify coin mixing classes with well-defined patterns, which leads to an overall low recall rate. Multiple rules could improve the recall in this situation, yet they are ineffective for new classes and classes with ambiguous patterns. This paper considers coin mixing detection as a transaction classification problem and proposes an LSTM Transaction Tree Classifier (LSTM-TC) solution, which includes feature extraction and classification of Bitcoin transactions based on deep learning. We also build a dataset to validate our solution. Experiments show that our approach has better performance and the potential for discovering new classes of coin mixing transactions than rule-based approaches and graph neural network-based Bitcoin transaction classification algorithms.","[Sun, Xiaowen; Yang, Tan; Hu, Bo] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Natl Pilot Software Engn Sch, Sch Comp Sci, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China","Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications","Yang, T (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Natl Pilot Software Engn Sch, Sch Comp Sci, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.","sxw@bupt.edu.cn; tyang@bupt.edu.cn; hubo@bupt.edu.cn","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2020YFE0200500]","National Key Research and Development Program of China","This work is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant No.2020YFE0200500","","39","2","2","3","13","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0924-669X","1573-7497","","APPL INTELL","Appl.

We conduct two separate analyses based first on all Twitter accounts and then on the most influential 50 Twitter accounts, which have been selected as such by Unitedtraders. We use the number of positive, negative and neutral tweets by Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) in a logistic model to analyse if tweets have any valuable information about the change in both return and trade volume of bitcoin. Our results indicate that tweets can be used to predict bitcoin returns. Notably, the most influential accounts are the drivers of returns, but all Twitter accounts simply introduce some noise in volatility. This result indicates that following only these 50 most influential accounts may provide the information needed for investors.","[Ozturk, Serda Selin; Bilgic, M.

We also discuss the probability of unintentional as well as intentional forks. We have found that the impact of selfish mining on network performance is noticeable, and in extreme cases, disproportional to the number of selfish miners or their hash power compared to honest nodes. Our analysis has also found that forking probability is dominated by intentional forking resulting from selfish behavior, which has the potential to increase the ledger inconsistency time and open the door to security attacks.","[Motlagh, Saeideh G.; Misic, Jelena; Misic, Vojislav B.] Ryerson Univ, Comp Sci, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada","Toronto Metropolitan University","Misic, VB (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Comp Sci, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada.","sgholamrezazadeh@ryerson.ca; jmisic@ryerson.ca; vmisic@ryerson.ca","","G.

We perform a data driven study of Bitcoin and present possible attacks based on spatial and temporal characteristics of its network. Towards that, we revisit the prior work, dedicated to the study of centralization of Bitcoin nodes over the Internet, through a fine-grained analysis of network distribution, and highlight the increasing centralization of the Bitcoin network over time. As a result, we show that Bitcoin is vulnerable to spatial, temporal, spatio-temporal, and logical partitioning attacks with an increased attack feasibility due to the network dynamics.

However, this perceived anonymity is a false sense of security as both on-chain transactions and the underlying message exchange in the peer-to-peer network are attack vectors for deanonymisation and monitoring, as shown in other research. Nonetheless, there has been an increase in Bitcoin usage not only for end-users but also in the context of cybercrime in the form of cryptojacking and ransomware. So there are a number of reasons why proxies might be used in the Bitcoin network, either as a privacy-preserving measure of end-users or as obfuscation in cybercrime. In this paper, we present a measurement study with the goal of characterising the proxy and VPN usage in the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network. We developed YABA (Yet Another Bitcoin Analyser) to gather network data in a geographically distributed fashion and analyse it. We describe our techniques to infer proxy/VPN usage and load on the peer through different latency measurements and the limitations of our approaches. We utilise port scanning of standard proxy/VPN service ports to compare results. We deployed our infrastructure on three continents (4 workers) and continuously crawled the network, with a total of 26.9 million connection attempts over five days. We conclude the usage of proxies to be minimal, with an estimated 0.4% of peers detected through latency measurements. Similar prevalence was measured through the use of port scans with SOCKS port hitrate at 0.3%, while common VPN ports had hitrates between 0.18% and 0.7%.","[Muehle, Alexander; Gruener, Andreas; Meinel, Christoph] Hasso Plattner Inst, Potsdam, DE, Germany","University of Potsdam","Muhle, A (corresponding author), Hasso Plattner Inst, Potsdam, DE, Germany.","alexander.muehle@hpi.de; andreas.gruener@hpi.de; christoph.meinel@hpi.de","","","German Federal Printing Office (Bundesdruckerei)","German Federal Printing Office (Bundesdruckerei)","This work has been supported and partially funded by the German Federal Printing Office (Bundesdruckerei).","","25","0","0","0","2","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-8933-4","","","","2021","","","","","","","176","185","","10.1145/3427796.3427840","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3427796.3427840","","","10","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS1JR","","Bronze","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000691780200023","View Full Record in Web of Science"

To do that, the techniques used with the data set include wavelet-based covariance, correlation, coherence spectrum, continuous power spectrum and Granger causality test. Findings The findings of the study suggest that interrelationships between Bitcoin and the key financial asset returns are statistically significant at low, medium and high frequencies. This study also finds the existence of the unidirectional connectedness between Bitcoin the other assets in India. Practical implications The outcome of the analysis calls for substantial policy implications for investors, portfolio management in India. This research on the existence of the interconnectedness between Bitcoin and other conventional asset classes in a specific country context, India can, therefore, make a significant contribution to the contemporary debate about the speculative nature of the cryptocurrencies. It casts light on whether Bitcoin provides any diversification and risk management benefits for Indian, as well as global investors.

Thus, modern blockchain designs began to prune old blocks and rely on recent snapshots for their bootstrapping processes instead. Unfortunately, established systems are often considered incapable of adopting these improvements. In this work, we present CoinPrune, our block-pruning scheme with full Bitcoin compatibility, to revise this popular belief. CoinPrune bootstraps joining nodes via snapshots that are periodically created from Bitcoin's set of unspent transaction outputs (UTXO set). Our scheme establishes trust in these snapshots by relying on CoinPrunesupporting miners to mutually reaffirm a snapshot's correctness on the blockchain. This way, snapshots remain trustworthy even if adversaries attempt to tamper with them. Our scheme maintains its retrospective deployability by relying on positive feedback only, i.e., blocks containing invalid reaffirmations are not rejected, but invalid reaffirmations are outpaced by the benign ones created by an honest majority among CoinPrunesupporting miners. Already today, CoinPrune reduces the storage requirements for Bitcoin nodes by two orders of magnitude, as joining nodes need to fetch and process only 6 GiB instead of 271 GiB of data in our evaluation, reducing the synchronization time of powerful devices from currently 7 h to 51 min, with even larger potential drops for less powerful devices. CoinPrune is further aware of higher-level application data, i.e., it conserves otherwise pruned application data and allows nodes to obfuscate objectionable and potentially illegal blockchain content from their UTXO set and the snapshots they distribute.","[Matzutt, Roman; Kalde, Benedikt; Pennekamp, Jan; Wehrle, Klaus] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Chair Commun & Distributed Syst, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Drichel, Arthur] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, IT Secur Res Grp, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Henze, Martin] Fraunhofer FKIE, Cyber Anal & Def Dept, D-53343 Wachtberg, Germany","RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University","Matzutt, R (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Chair Commun & Distributed Syst, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.","matzutt@comsys.rwth-aachen.de; kalde@comsys.rwth-aachen.de; pennekamp@comsys.rwth-aachen.de; drichel@itsec.rwth-aachen.de; martin.henze@fkie.fraunhofer.de; wehrle@comsys.rwth-aachen.de","Henze, Martin/I-3623-2014; Pennekamp, Jan/AAD-5622-2020","Henze, Martin/0000-0001-8717-2523; Pennekamp, Jan/0000-0003-0398-6904; Wehrle, Klaus/0000-0001-7252-4186; Matzutt, Roman/0000-0002-4263-5317","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [16KIS0443, 16DHLQ013, Z31]; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) [Z31]","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD))","This work has been funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under funding reference numbers 16KIS0443, 16DHLQ013, and Z31 BMBF Digital Campus.

This paper aims to analyse the Bitcoin dynamics and the investor response by focusing on herd biases. Therefore, the main objective of this work is to study the degree of efficiency through multifractal analysis in order to detect herd behaviour leading to build the best predictions and strategies. Design/methodology/approach This paper develops a novel methodology that detects the presence of herding biases and assesses the inefficiency of Bitcoin through an inefficiency index (MLM) by using statistical indicators defined by measures of persistence. This study, also, investigates the nonlinear dynamical properties of Bitcoin by estimating the Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) leading to deduce the effect of COVID-19 on the Bitcoin performance. Besides, this work performs an event study to capture abnormal changes created by COVID-19 related events capable to analyse the Bitcoin market response. Findings The empirical results of the generalized Hurst exponent GHE estimation indicates that Bitcoin is multifractal before this pandemic and becomes less fractal after the outbreak. Using an efficiency index (MLM), Bitcoin is found to be more efficient after the pandemic. Based on the Hausdorff topology, the authors showed that this pandemic has reduced the herd bias. Research limitations/implications The uncertainty of COVID-19 disease and the lasting of its duration make it difficult to make the best prediction. Practical implications The main contribution of this study is the evaluation of the Bitcoin value after the COVID19 outbreak. This work has practical implications as it provides new insights on trading opportunities and social reactions. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, this work represents the first study that analyses the Bitcoin response to different events related to COVID-19 and detects the presence of herding behaviour in such a crisis.","[Mnif, Emna; Jarboui, Anis] Univ Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia","Universite de Sfax","Jarboui, A (corresponding author), Univ Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia.","anisjarboui@yahoo.fr","JARBOUI, Anis/AAX-3227-2021","JARBOUI, Anis/0000-0002-4811-6729","","","","","47","9","9","2","20","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1940-5979","1940-5987","","REV BEHAV FINANCE","Rev.

This paper also aims to see which macro variable relates more to the price of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. Since the whole concept of cryptocurrencies is quite novel, an attempt has been made to briefly explain the underlying blockchain technology that forms the bedrock of cryptocurrencies. In this study, we use secondary data, i.e., the price history of Bitcoin from September 2014 to September 2021 for the last seven years, captured from trading exchanges. We predicted monthly returns of Bitcoin with that of Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S & P 500), gold, and Treasury Bonds. Our findings show that Bitcoin has very high volatility compared to S & P 500, Gold and Treasury Bonds. Also, our findings show that there is a positive correlation between Bitcoin's price volatility and the other three financial assets before and during COVID-19. Hence, Bitcoin is acting more as a speculative asset rather than a steady store of value. This can be drawn from the comparison with the debt market i.e., a Treasury Bond that invests in long-dated (30 years) US treasuries with which Bitcoin shows no relationship. The findings of this study could help with understanding the future of Bitcoin. This has important implications for Bitcoin investors.

To counter this, the Bitcoin community uses several methods to obscure transactions, including shared send transactions among others. We attempt to peer into these transactions through a pairing of address clustering and shared send untangling and test our experimental results through path finding between addresses. We then implement our methodology to test its effectiveness. Our findings show that while using clustering can improve path-finding results and shared send untangling, we recommend applying heuristics in combination to increase effectiveness.","[Eck, Dylan] Colorado Sch Mines, Dept Mech Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Torek, Adam; Cutchin, Steven; Dagher, Gaby G.] Boise State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Boise, ID 83725 USA","Colorado School of Mines; Idaho; Boise State University","Eck, D (corresponding author), Colorado Sch Mines, Dept Mech Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USA.","dylaneck@mines.edu; adamtorek@u.boisestate.edu; stevencutchin@boisestate.edu; gabydagher@boisestate.edu","","","","","","","14","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-1760-0","","","","2021","","","","","","","388","393","","10.1109/BLOCKCHAIN53845.2021.00061","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BLOCKCHAIN53845.2021.00061","","","6","","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","","BS9CN","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000779214600049","View Full Record in Web of Science"

From the study on the daily prices of Bitcoin and the assets for the time period of July 2014 to November 2019, a neutral dependence is indicated in most circumstances between Bitcoin and crude oil as well as the aggregate indices. Meanwhile, for the U.S. dollar index, a weak unidirectional causal relationship is identified at wavelet level two. The notable exception is gold, which shows strong bidirectional causality at most of the wavelet levels, a phenomenon that interestingly has not been generally captured.

The cross-market discrepancy in market efficiency gradually vanishes, suggesting the segmented markets are developing to a consensus where all markets are equally efficient. Through a fractionally cointegrated vector autoregressive (FCVAR) model we show that when the efficiency in Bitcoin/USD and Bitcoin/AUD markets improves the cross-market arbitrage potential narrows, whereas it widens when the efficiency in Bitcoin/CAD, Bitcoin/EUR, and Bitcoin/GBP markets improves.

These studies all ignore the issues of heavy tails and extreme events during COVID-19, which are obstacles to obtaining the reliable continuous time-varying results of long memory and efficiency. After considering the two issues, we first obtain the reliable continuous time-varying results during COVID-19 via sliding window and estimation of Hurst exponent. The other four markets (Ethereum, Binance Coin, S&P 500, and gold spot) are also analysed for comparison. Bitcoin results show that the Bitcoin market keeps efficient during the pandemic and the heavy tails become weaker after the onset of the pandemic. Results of the comparison study show that Bitcoin has similar efficiency with spot gold and is more efficient than Ethereum, Binance Coin, and S&P 500 during the pandemic.

To this aim, the present paper introduces results from an analysis of transaction handling in Bitcoin. Specifically, the analysis consists of two parts. The first part is an exploratory data analysis revealing key characteristics in Bitcoin transaction handling. The second part is a predictability analysis intended to provide insights on transaction handling such as (i) transaction confirmation time, (ii) block attributes, and (iii) who has created the block.

However, this view cannot be supported by the negative impact, the major reason is that the burst of bubble undermines the hedging ability of Bitcoin. The above results are inconsistent with the intertemporal capital asset pricing model (ICAPM), underlining that high PC may drive BP to rise, in order to compensate for the losses and costs from factionalism.

In addition to revealing a significant impact of the Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI) on short- and long-term Bitcoin returns, this paper highlights the nonlinearity and asymmetry of this relationship in the short and long run, as well as the relevance of estimating Bitcoin sentiment using trade data.","[Gaies, Brahim] IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France; [Nakhli, Mohamed Sahbi] Univ Kairouan, ISIG Kairouan, Kairouan, Tunisia; [Nakhli, Mohamed Sahbi] Univ Sousse, LaREMFIQ Lab, Sousse, Tunisia; [Sahut, Jean Michel] IDRAC Business Sch, Amiens, France; [Guesmi, Khaled] Paris Sch Business, Paris, France","IPAG Business School; Universite de Kairouan; Universite de Sousse","Sahut, JM (corresponding author), IDRAC Business Sch, Amiens, France.","gaies_brahim@yahoo.fr; sahbinakhli@yahoo.fr; jeanmichel.sahut@idraclyon.com; kalloda_fr@yahoo.fr","NAKHLI, Mohamed Sahbi/AAA-1573-2022","NAKHLI, Mohamed Sahbi/0000-0001-5708-5314","","","","","60","9","9","6","20","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","0040-1625","1873-5509","","TECHNOL FORECAST SOC","Technol.

Identifying and analyzing the transaction behaviors of users within these industries helps to understand the Bitcoin ecosystem from a macro perspective. Currently, industry identification mainly faces two issues. First, the anonymity of Bitcoin makes it difficult to identify the industry identifiers of users who participate in activities through different addresses. Second, since users usually engage in multiple industries at different periods, both the identification of their dynamically changing industry identifiers and the detection of their mostly engaged industry are challenging research tasks. In this paper, we propose an industry identification approach for Bitcoin users. First, we develop a fine-grained address clustering method to mine the relationship between addresses and their owners. Compared with existing methods, this method improves 0.18 in accuracy and 0.60 in recall. Based on temporal networks, we then train a multi-label classification model to identify the dynamically changing industry identifiers of users with an average accuracy of 0.92. With respect to multi-industry users, we further propose a major industry identifier detection method to identify the industry where users are mostly engaged. Applying this approach, we reproduce the major activity trajectories of users across the industries, which provides us with an opportunity to analyze the transaction behaviors of users within the industries.","[Han, Weili; Chen, Dingjie; Wang, Kai; Chen, Chen; Huang, Dapeng; Fan, Zhijie] Fudan Univ, Sch Software, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Pang, Jun] Univ Luxembourg, Dept Comp Sci, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg","Fudan University; University of Luxembourg","Han, WL (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Software, Shanghai, Peoples R China.","wlhan@fudan.edu.cn","","Pang, Jun/0000-0002-4521-4112","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC0830900]; Natural Science Foundation of China [U1836207]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2020M670998]","National Key R&D Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation)","This paper has been supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC0830900), Natural Science Foundation of China (U1836207), and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2020M670998).","","24","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-85928-2; 978-3-030-85927-5","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2021","12937","","","","","","108","120","","10.1007/978-3-030-85928-2_9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-85928-2_9","","","13","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Mathematics; Telecommunications","BS5DI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000728191800009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Bitcoin has the characteristics of high anonymity, decentralization, peer-to-peer, and the use of asymmetric encryption. These high tech features make bitcoin a new criminal tool which often used by organized criminal groups. Therefore, analyzing bitcoin flow has become critical for law enforcement to conduct a criminal investigation. However, due to its UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) transaction pattern, many change wallets are generated in analyzing bitcoin flow, which affects the judgment of actual money flow analysis. In this research, we implement input-output differential and temporary rules to detect change wallets by analyzing bitcoin transaction pattern characteristics. Furthermore, we design web crawlers as a tool to collect and parse transactions of highly suspected criminal bitcoin wallets. Micro and macro perspectives of network analysis are provided by social network analysis (SNA) and visualization technology. The experimental results indicate that the proposed rules can detect both clustered and marginal change wallets. By eliminating the noise information caused by change wallets can provide coherent financial flows of interpretation for criminal investigation.","[Chen, Shan-Wen; Liu, Kuan-Po; Tsai, Fu-Ching] Cent Police Univ, Dept Criminal Invest, Taoyuan, Taiwan","","Tsai, FC (corresponding author), Cent Police Univ, Dept Criminal Invest, Taoyuan, Taiwan.","fctsai@mail.cpu.edu.tw","","","Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of china [MOST 109-2410-H-015-007]; Executive yuan of the Republic of China [110]","Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of china(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Executive yuan of the Republic of China","This research was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of china under the grants MOST 109-2410-H-015-007 -And also partially supported by the Executive yuan of the Republic of China under the Grants Forward-looking infrastructure Development Program (Digital Infrastucture-Information Security Project - 110)","","9","0","0","1","5","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1738-9445","","979-11-88428-06-9","INT CONF ADV COMMUN","","","2021","","","","","","","35","41","","","","","","7","Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Telecommunications","BR6NI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000662194300006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The modeling and forecasting of bitcoin volatility are crucial for bitcoin investors' decision-making analysis and risk management. However, most previous studies of bitcoin volatility were founded on econometric models. Research on bitcoin volatility forecasting using machine learning algorithms is still sparse. In this study, both conventional econometric models and a machine learning model are used to forecast the bitcoin's return volatility and Value at Risk. The objective of this study is to compare their out-of-sample performance in forecasting accuracy and risk management efficiency. The results demonstrate that the RNN outperforms GARCH and EWMA in average forecasting performance. However, it is less efficient in capturing the bitcoin market's extreme events. Moreover, the RNN shows poor performance in Value at Risk forecasting, indicating that it could not work well as the econometric models in explaining extreme volatility. This study proposes an alternative method of bitcoin volatility analysis and provides more motivation for economic researchers to apply machine learning methods to the less volatile financial market conditions. Meanwhile, it also shows that the machine learning approaches are not always more advanced than econometric models, contrary to common belief.","[Shen, Ze; Leatham, David J.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Wan, Qing] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station","Shen, Z (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.","sz910201@tamu.edu; frankqingwan@gmail.com; d-leatham@tamu.edu","","","","","","","21","2","2","2","3","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

This is now a prevailing and accepted feature in cryptocurrency markets, however unsustainable it may be. This paper investigates as to how Bitcoin's price volatility and the underlying dynamics of cryptocurrency mining characteristics affect underlying energy markets and utilities companies. Further analysis of potential side-effects within the market for Exchange Traded Funds are considered. The results show a sustained and significant influence of cryptocurrency energy-usage on the performance of some companies in the energy sector as separated by jurisdiction, emphasising the importance of further assessment of environmental impacts of cryptocurrency growth. Robustness testing presents evidence that dynamic correlations peaked during the sharp Bitcoin price appreciation of late-2017 as investors re-evaluated how this increased energy usage would influence the profitability of utility companies.","[Corbet, Shaen] Dublin City Univ, DCU Business Sch, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Corbet, Shaen] Univ Waikato, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Lucey, Brian] Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Business Sch, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Lucey, Brian] Univ Sydney, Univ Sydney Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Lucey, Brian] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Inst Business Res, 59C Nguyen Dinh Chieu,Ward 6,Dist 3, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Lucey, Brian] Jiangxi Univ Econ & Finance, Inst Ind Econ, 169 East Shuanggang Rd, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Yarovaya, Larisa] Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England","Dublin City University; University of Waikato; Trinity College Dublin; University of Sydney; Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Solent University; University of Southampton","Lucey, B (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Business Sch, Dublin 2, Ireland.","blucey@tcd.ie","lucey, brian/AAY-3885-2021; Corbet, Shaen/B-4869-2017","lucey, brian/0000-0002-4052-8235; Corbet, Shaen/0000-0001-7430-7417; Yarovaya, Larisa/0000-0002-9638-2917","","","","","30","27","27","3","21","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0301-4207","1873-7641","","RESOUR POLICY","Resour.

Its price dynamics, characterized by extreme volatility, severe jumps, and impressive long-term appreciation, suggest that bitcoin is a new digital asset. This study presents a comprehensive overview of the fractality of bitcoin in a high-frequency framework, namely by applying Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) and a Multifractal Regime Detecting Method (MRDM) to Bitstamp 1 min bitcoin returns from January 2013 to July 2020. The results suggest that bitcoin is multifractal, with smaller and larger fluctuations being persistent and anti-persistent, respectively. Multifractality comes from significant long-range correlations, which cast some doubts on the informational efficiency at this frequency, but mainly comes from fat-tails, which highlights the significant risks undertaken by investors in this market. Our most important result is that the degree and richness of multifractality is time-varying and increased after 2017, when volumes and prices experienced an explosive behaviour. This complexity puts into perspective the duality of bitcoin: while it is characterized by long-run attractiveness and increasing valuation, it also has a high short-run instability. Hence, this study provides some empirical evidence supporting the relationship between these two observable features.","[Vaz, Cristiana] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Dept Math, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal; [Pascoal, Rui; Sebastiao, Helder] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Ctr Business & Econ Res CeBER, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal","Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra","Sebastiao, H (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Ctr Business & Econ Res CeBER, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal.","uc2019190214@student.uc.pt; ruiapsp@fe.uc.pt; helderse@fe.uc.pt","Sebastiao, Helder/F-2162-2017","Sebastiao, Helder/0000-0002-1743-6869; Pascoal, Rui/0000-0002-6207-9661","FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, I.P.

Bitcoin mining is used as an exemplary case of a decentralized network that utilizes abstract labour as a regulatory mechanism. The process of Bitcoin mining is described in detail, and its consequences for the organization of labour are discussed. I argue that Bitcoin mining is a form of socialized work where abstract labour becomes a mechanism of control and thus also a source of Bitcoin's value. I further demonstrate the controlling aspects of abstract labour on three interdependent dimensions: control of Bitcoin's integrity, control of access to the network, and control of the class positions within the network. Consequentially, Negri's and Marx's views on value serve as complementary approaches to value creation in decentralized networks.","[Tremcinsky, Martin] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Sociol Studies, Prague, Czech Republic","Charles University Prague","Tremcinsky, M (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Sociol Studies, Prague, Czech Republic.","martin.tremcinsky@fsv.cuni.cz","","","Charles University, project GA UK [1298119]","Charles University, project GA UK","The article was supported by the Charles University, project GA UK No. 1298119.","","59","1","1","0","2","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0304-4092","1573-0786","","DIALECT ANTHROPOL","Dialect.

Despite its strong protection for security and privacy, the current Bitcoin blockchain can only support a low number of transactions per second (TPS). In this work, we redesign the current Bitcoin's networking protocol to increase TPS without changing vital components in its consensus-building protocol. In particular, we improve the compact-block relaying protocol to enable the propagation of blocks containing a massive number of transactions without inducing extra propagation latency. This improvement is achieved by replacing the existing store-and-forward compact-block relaying scheme with a cut-through compact-block relaying scheme. Since our protocol only needs to rework the current Bitcoin's networking protocol and does not modify the data structures and crypto-functional components, it can be seamlessly incorporated into the existing Bitcoin blockchain. To validate our design, we implement a Bitcoin network simulator on Network Simulator3 (NS-3) to run different block propagation protocols. The experimental results confirm that our new block propagation protocol could increase the TPS of the Bitcoin blockchain by 100x without compromising security and consensus-building.","[Zhang, Lihao; Liew, Soung Chang] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Informat Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Taotao] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China","Chinese University of Hong Kong; Shenzhen University","Zhang, LH (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Informat Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","zl018@ie.cuhk.edu.hk; ttwang@szu.edu.cn; soung@ie.cuhk.edu.hk","","","Tencent Rhinoceros Birds Scientific Research Foundation for Young Teachers of Shenzhen University; Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Province [2020A1515010708]","Tencent Rhinoceros Birds Scientific Research Foundation for Young Teachers of Shenzhen University; Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province)","This work was supported in part by the Tencent Rhinoceros Birds Scientific Research Foundation for Young Teachers of Shenzhen University, and in part by the Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Province under Grant 2020A1515010708.","","26","0","0","1","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-1762-4","","","","2021","","","","","","","352","358","","10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData-Cybermatics53846.2021.00063","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData-Cybermatics53846.2021.00063","","","7","Computer Science, Cybernetics; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT0ZT","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000795905900048","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Results show that historical daily prices of both assets-taking into account one year before and one year after the maximum price level-clearly show the two phases of bubble expansion and subsequent crash. Furthermore, various similarities between the South Sea Bubble and Bitcoin can be found in descriptive statistics, such as mean of return, standard deviation, and skewness. Statistical tests also show several explosive moments in the time series of the South Sea Company and Bitcoin returns, which implies that both assets exhibit more than one financial bubble.","[Demmler, Michael] Univ Autonoma Queretaro, Fac Accounting & Adm, Queretaro, Mexico; [Fernandez Dominguez, Amilcar Orlian] Univ Autonoma Chihuahua, Fac Accounting & Adm, Chihuahua, Mexico","Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro","Demmler, M (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Queretaro, Fac Accounting & Adm, Queretaro, Mexico.","michael.demmler@uaq.mx; afernand@uach.mx","; Fernandez, Amilcar Orlian/P-5341-2016","Demmler, Michael/0000-0002-1629-5814; Fernandez, Amilcar Orlian/0000-0003-4209-9056","","","","","63","0","0","3","4","UNIV CATOLICA COLOMBIA, FAC ECONOMIA","BOGOTA","AV CARACAS 46-72, BOGOTA, 00000, COLOMBIA","2248-6046","2011-7663","","REV FINANZAS POLITIC","Rev.

Design/methodology/approach The data used to forecast time series data of Bitcoin returns ranges from 8 July 2010 to 30 Aug 2020. This study used several predictors to predict bitcoin returns including economic policy uncertainty, equity market volatility index, S&P returns, USD/EURO exchange rates, oil and gold prices, volatilities and returns. Five statistical indexes, namely, correlation coefficient, mean absolute error, root mean square error, relative absolute error and root relative squared error are determined. The results of these metrices are used to develop colour intensity ranking. Findings Among the machine learning (ML) techniques used in this study, RF models has shown superior predictive ability for estimating the Bitcoin returns. Originality/value This study is first of its kind to use and compare ML models in the prediction of Bitcoins. More studies can be carried out by using further cryptocurrencies and other ML data-driven models in future.","[Shakri, Irfan Haider] Edith Cowan Univ, Joondalup, Australia","Edith Cowan University","Shakri, IH (corresponding author), Edith Cowan Univ, Joondalup, Australia.","irfanshakri@gmail.com","Shakri, Irfan/AFB-2422-2022; Shakri, Irfan/AAF-7456-2022","Shakri, Irfan/0000-0001-9967-1100; Shakri, Irfan/0000-0001-9967-1100","","","","","45","0","0","1","12","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1086-7376","1755-6791","","STUD ECON FINANC","Stud.

There have been a number of research studies that have presented bitcoin price prediction models, but none of them have looked at the controlling variables linked with bitcoin transaction timestamps. It might be that price is not the only key criteria influencing bitcoin transactions, or the available model for bitcoin price prediction is yet to consider timestamp as a determining factor in its transaction. A better and more accurate model would be required to predict how the Timestamp influences changes of bitcoin transactions. That is why this current study utilized a Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous (NARX) Neural Network Model for the prediction of timestamp influence on Bitcoin value. Bitcoin historical datasets which are converted to a nonlinear regression into a well-formulated statistical problem in the manner of a ridge regression are used. Simulation analysis indicates that bitcoin digital currency's performance variation is highly influenced by its transaction timestamp with the prediction accuracy of 96%. The contributions of this research lies with the fact that specific Bitcoin transaction events repeat themselves over and over again, meaning that the Open-Price, High-Price, Low-Price, and Close-Price of Bitcoin price over timestamp developed a pattern that was predicted by NARX with less That means those involved in the transaction of bitcoin at the wrong timestamp will certainly face the uncertainty negative effect of the bitcoin market.","[Aljojo, Nahla] Univ Jeddah, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Informat Syst & Technol Dept, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Alshutayri, Areej; Aldhahri, Eman] Univ Jeddah, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Almandeel, Seita] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Business Adm, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Zainol, Azida] Univ Jeddah, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Software Engn Dept, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","University of Jeddah; University of Jeddah; King Abdulaziz University; University of Jeddah","Aljojo, N (corresponding author), Univ Jeddah, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Informat Syst & Technol Dept, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.","nmaljojo@uj.edu.sa","; Aljojo, Nahla/I-1380-2014","Aldhahri, Eman/0000-0002-4233-4610; Aljojo, Nahla/0000-0003-2501-8533","Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), University of Jeddah, Jeddah [UJ-20-121-DR]","Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), University of Jeddah, Jeddah","This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), University of Jeddah, Jeddah, under Grant UJ-20-121-DR.","","55","0","0","4","12","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2021","9","","","","","","148611","148624","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124629","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124629","","","14","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","WU6YU","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000716689500001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Its market capitalization transcends all other cryptocurrencies in the market. But its high monetary value also makes it an attractive target to cyber criminal actors. Hacking campaigns usually target an ecosystem's weakest points. In Bitcoin, the exchange platforms are one of them. Each exchange breach is a threat not only to direct victims, but to the credibility of Bitcoin's entire ecosystem. Based on an extensive analysis of 36 breaches of Bitcoin exchanges, we show the attack patterns used to exploit Bitcoin exchange platforms using an industry standard for reporting intelligence on cyber security breaches. Based on this we are able to provide an overview of the most common attack vectors, showing that all except three hacks were possible due to relatively lax security. We show that while the security regimen of Bitcoin exchanges is subpar compared to other financial service providers, the use of stolen credentials, which does not require any hacking, is decreasing. We also show that the amount of BTC taken during a breach is decreasing, as well as the exchanges that terminate after being breached. Furthermore we show that overall security posture has improved, but still has major flaws. To discover adversarial methods post-breach, we have analyzed two cases of BTC laundering. Through this analysis we provide insight into how exchange platforms with lax cyber security even further increase the intermediary risk introduced by them into the Bitcoin ecosystem.","[Oosthoek, Kris] Delft Univ Technol, Cyber Threat Intelligence Lab, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands; [Doerr, Christian] Univ Potsdam, Hasso Plattner Inst Digital Engn, Cyber Threat Intelligence Lab, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany","Delft University of Technology; University of Potsdam","Oosthoek, K (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Cyber Threat Intelligence Lab, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands.","k.oosthoek@tudelft.nl; christian.doerr@hpi.de","","Oosthoek, Kris/0000-0002-6088-5950","","","","","76","0","0","1","13","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","1932-4537","","","IEEE T NETW SERV MAN","IEEE Trans.

This paper investigates the reaction of Bitcoin prices to uncertainty concerning fiat currencies by introducing a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN)-based event analysis approach. The 2013 Cyprus bailout is used as an event over the uncertainty of fiat currencies. With the proposed approach, the original Bitcoin price series is decomposed into high-frequency, low-frequency, and trend components, thus disentangling the short-, medium-, and long-term effects of the events on Bitcoin prices, respectively. We find that the low-frequency component is dominant and increased because of the event. In addition, the announcement significantly increased the intensity of shortterm fluctuations in Bitcoin prices. However, there was no structural change in Bitcoin prices in the long-term trend. This paper provides a way to show the reaction of Bitcoin prices to the uncertainty of fiat currencies at different time scales and suggests that the reaction is mainly captured by the medium-term trend.","[Jin, Xuejun; Zhu, Keer] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Econ, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xiaolan] Shanghai Int Studies Univ, Sch Business & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shouyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shouyang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China","Zhejiang University; Shanghai International Studies University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Yang, XL (corresponding author), Shanghai Int Studies Univ, Sch Business & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China.","yangxiaolan@shisu.edu.cn","","","Natural Science Foundation of China [71873089, 71988101, G030202]","Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (No.71873089; No.71988101; No.G030202) .

In this context, countries have implemented cap-and-trade markets of carbon emissions allowances to manage the impact of CO2 released by companies. Over recent years, cryptocurrencies have given a new drive to pollution because of the massive energy consumption of mining activity. This paper investigates the tail relationship between the carbon credit market and the price of Bitcoin. For this purpose, we use two novel econometric models: the multivariate-quantile conditional autoregressive (MVMQCAViaR) model and Granger causality across quantiles. The results suggest that there is a downside risk spillover, i.e., tail co-dependence. We find that Bitcoin spillovers have a stronger impact on the carbon market. On the other hand, we show that the carbon market does not Granger-cause Bitcoin. The results of the Granger analysis confirm the multivariate quantile model's findings, i.e., Bitcoin influences the carbon market in the lower quantiles.

These transactions typically languish in a local buffer until they are evicted or all their parents are discovered, at which point they may be propagated further. To date, there has been little work in the literature on characterizing the nature and impact of such orphans, and yet it is intuitive that they should affect the performance of the Bitcoin network. This work thus seeks to methodically research such effects through a measurement campaign on live Bitcoin nodes. Our data show that about 45% of orphan transactions end up being included in the blockchain. Surprisingly, orphan transactions tend to have fewer parents on average than non-orphan transactions, and their missing parents have a lower fee, larger size, and lower transaction fee per byte than all other received transactions. Moreover, the network overhead incurred by these orphan transactions can be significant, exceeding 17% when using the default orphan memory pool size (i.e., 100 transactions), although this overhead can be made negligible, without significant computational or memory demands, if the pool size is simply increased to 1000 transactions. Finally, we show that when a node with an empty mempool first joins the network, 25% of the transactions that it receives become orphan, whereas in steady-state this quantity drops to about 1%.","[Imtiaz, Muhammad Anas; Starobinski, David; Trachtenberg, Ari] Boston Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Boston University","Imtiaz, MA (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","maimtiaz@bu.edu; staro@bu.edu; trachten@bu.edu","; Imtiaz, Muhammad Anas/F-1092-2018","Starobinski, David/0000-0002-8071-3865; Imtiaz, Muhammad Anas/0000-0001-6836-6971","NSF [CCF-1563753]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was supported in part by NSF under grant CCF-1563753.","","46","2","2","0","1","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","1932-4537","","","IEEE T NETW SERV MAN","IEEE Trans.

The same applies to exchange rates of unbacked currencies. Albeit, empirically investors are found to be driven by online and offline news media. This study analyzes the Bitcoin cryptocurrency price series and web search queries with regard to their mutual predictability and cause-effect delay structure. Chinese Baidu engine searches and compounded Baidu-Google search statistics predict Bitcoin price dynamics at relatively high frequencies ranging from 2 to 5 months. In the other direction, Granger-causality runs from the cryptocurrency price to queries statistics across nearly all frequencies. In both directions, the reaction time computed from a phase delay measure for the relevant frequency bands with significant causality ranges from about 1 to 4 months. For either direction, out-of-sample forecasts are more accurate than forecasts of a benchmark stochastic process. Bivariate models including the Baidu Search Index slightly outperform competing models that include a Baidu-Google composite index. Predictive power seems less diluted if the September 2017 trade regulations by the Chinese government are controlled for.","[Suessmuth, Bernd] Univ Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany; [Suessmuth, Bernd] CESifo, Munich, Germany","Leipzig University; Ifo Institut","Sussmuth, B (corresponding author), Inst Empir Res Econ, Grimma Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.","suessmuth@wifa.uni-leipzig.de","","","Projekt DEAL","Projekt DEAL","Foremost, I gratefully appreciate very helpful comments and suggestions by two anonymous referees that markedly improved the paper.

In terms of the stringent security and anonymity issues, a novel anonymous and decentralized payment platform is demanded. Bitcoin is regarded as a potential solution. But the existing Bitcoin and its various improvements lack a beforehand anti-fraud Bitcoin deposit scheme, which is necessary to prevent potential fraud risks from Bitcoin to CVs. This paper aims to build a novel anti-fraud deposit scheme as a seamless bridge between CV networks and the Bitcoin payment platform. We propose a Bitcoin-to-Connected-Vehicle deposit scheme (Bit2CV) with an outsourcing endorsement in order to build an anti-fraud deposit transaction (dtr). Firstly, Bit2CV leverages a special Bitcoin-opcode-OP_RETURN based method to record the dtr, the CV's request, and the endorsement together on Blockchain ledger. This method can achieve security features, including non-repudiation, privacy-friendly endorsement, future audit, and anti-fraud. Meanwhile, Bit2CV is fully decentralized without any involvement of centralized authorities and fully compatible with the current Bitcoin network. We conduct the security analysis and also simulations for performance evaluation. In a typical scenario of our simulation, Bit2CV total time cost is less than 477.03 ms, and the size of the endorsement is 1,732 bytes, which is much less and smaller than transaction confirmation time and the average block size, respectively. These designs and results demonstrate that Bit2CV is feasible and practical.","[Li, Lun; Chang, Xiaolin; Liu, Jiqiang] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing Key Lab Secur & Privacy Intelligent Trans, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jingxian] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, State Key Lab Rail Traff Control & Safety, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Han, Zhu] Univ Houston, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Han, Zhu] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 446701, South Korea","Beijing Jiaotong University; Beijing Jiaotong University; University of Houston System; University of Houston; Kyung Hee University","Liu, JQ (corresponding author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing Key Lab Secur & Privacy Intelligent Trans, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.","lun.li@bjtu.edu.cn; xlchang@bjtu.edu.cn; liujingxian@bjtu.edu.cn; jqliu@bjtu.edu.cn; hanzhu22@gmail.com","Han, Zhu/ABG-1222-2021","Liu, jiqiang/0000-0003-1147-4327","Natural Science Foundation of China [61672092]; Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Projects of Shandong Province China [2019JZZY020128]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [2018JBZ103]; NSF [EARS-1839818, CNS1717454, CNS-1731424, CNS-1702850]","Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Projects of Shandong Province China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work was supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61672092, in part by the Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Projects of Shandong Province China under Grant 2019JZZY020128, in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China under Grant 2018JBZ103, and in part by NSF under Grant EARS-1839818, Grant CNS1717454, Grant CNS-1731424, and Grant CNS-1702850.","","48","1","1","3","7","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","1524-9050","1558-0016","","IEEE T INTELL TRANSP","IEEE Trans.

This paper uses the directed acyclic graph (DAG), spillover index, and network topology to provide strong evidence on the directional contagion outcomes of Bitcoin and other assets. The empirical results show that the contagion effect between Bitcoin and developed markets is strengthened during the COVID-19 crisis. Particularly, European market has a dominant role. Excluding Bitcoin's own shocks, United State and European markets are the main contagion sources to Bitcoin. European market also works as a intermediary to deliver infectious from United State and market fear. The findings show that gold always has contagion effect with Bitcoin, while gold, US dollar and bond market are the contagion receivers of Bitcoin under the shock of COVID-19.

Traditional approaches face two challenges: (1) it is difficult to ascertain the influential factors related to price forecasting; and (2) due to the 24/ 7 trading policy, cryptocurrencies' prices face very large fluctuations, thus weakening the forecasting power of traditional models. To address these issues, we focus on Bitcoin and identify the influential factors related to its price forecasting from the perspective of underlying blockchain transactions. We then propose a price forecasting model WT-CATCN, which leverages Wavelet Transform (WT) and Casual Multi-Head Attention (CA) Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), to forecast cryptocurrency prices. Our model can capture important positions of input sequences and model the correlations among different data features. Using real-world Bitcoin trading data, we test and compare WT-CATCN with other state-of-the-art price forecasting models.

It reveals that BR has positive and negative effects on BCP. The negative impact points out that Bitcoin is viewed as a tool to avoid uncertainties caused by the deterioration of BR, also proving that the strained relation between China and the U.S. can stimulate the Bitcoin market. However, this opinion is not held under a positive impact, the main explanation is that the burst of bubble weakens its ability to hedge risks. The above conclusion is not consistent with the theoretical model, underlining that the Bitcoin market is boosted by the deterioration of BR. Conversely, there is a negative influence from BCP to BR, meaning that the relationship between China and the U.S. can be reflected by the Bitcoin market.

One of the main characteristics of the market is that it often undergoes some events or incidents that cause outlying observations. To obtain reliable results in the statistical analysis of Bitcoin data, these outlying observations need to be carefully treated. In this study, we are interested in change point analysis for Bitcoin return series having such outlying observations. Since these outlying observations can affect change point analysis undesirably, we use a robust test for parameter change to locate change points. We report some significant change points that are not detected by the existing tests and demonstrate that the model allowing for parameter changes is better fitted to the data. Finally, we show that the model with parameter change can improve the forecasting performance of Value-at-Risk.","[Song, Junmo] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Stat, Daegu, South Korea; [Kang, Jiwon] Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Stat, 102 Jejudaehak Ro, Jeju Si, Jeju Do, South Korea","Kyungpook National University; Jeju National University","Kang, J (corresponding author), Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Stat, 102 Jejudaehak Ro, Jeju Si, Jeju Do, South Korea.","jwkang@jejunu.ac.kr","","","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2019R1I1A3A01056924]; Jeju National University","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education; Jeju National University","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2019R1I1A3A01056924) (J.

All selected auxiliary assets have very low dynamic correlation with Bitcoin, which classifies them as good diversifiers. According to parametric results, S&P500 has the best downside risk-minimizing output, while SHCOMP and gold take second and third place. However, when higher moments of portfolios are taken into account, the results change significantly. Due to very high kurtosis and negative skewness, portfolio with S&P500 has among the worst semiparametric downside risk results. On the other hand, SHCOMP index and gold have relatively favourable third and fourth moments' characteristics, which pushes them to the first and second place of the best auxiliary assets when modified downside risk measures are at stake.

The condition is determined using a set of instructions written in the Bitcoin scripting language. Unfortunately, this scripting language is not sophisticated enough to create complex conditions or smart contracts in general. Many admirable efforts have been made to build a smart contract infrastructure on top of the Bitcoin platform. In this paper, given the inherent limitations of the Bitcoin scripting language, we critically analyze the practical effectiveness of these methods. Afterwards, we formally define what a smart contract is and introduce seven requirements that if are satisfied, can make creation of smart contracts for Bitcoin possible. Based on the introduced requirements, we examine the ability of the current methods that use secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) to create smart contracts for Bitcoin and show where they fall short.

The purpose of this paper is to dig out more useful information in Bitcoin returns when we predict Bitcoin volatility. We use the threshold regression model to differentiate positive and negative returns. The threshold regression results suggest that not only a decrease in normal returns but also an increase in extremely positive returns would lead to an increase in future Bitcoin volatility. To further capture and address the leverage effect of large positive returns in the Bitcoin market, we propose a model switching method. We empirically demonstrate the significant predictive ability of large positive returns when forecasting Bitcoin volatility both in- and out-of-sample. And, our findings still hold after considering long-horizon forecasts, additional leverage effects, jump components, and a wide series of extensions and robustness tests. In an asset allocation exercise, the proposed volatility forecasting models, which highlight the predictive ability of large positive returns, can generate larger economic gains.","[Zhang, Yaojie; He, Mengxi; Wen, Danyan; Wang, Yudong] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Xiaolingwei 200, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China","Nanjing University of Science & Technology","Wang, YD (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Xiaolingwei 200, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China.","wendy2018@njust.edu.cn","Zhang, Yaojie/E-5530-2018; He, Mengxi/HCG-9835-2022","Zhang, Yaojie/0000-0002-4220-1623; Wen, Danyan/0000-0002-1349-8413; He, Mengxi/0000-0002-7241-825X","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [30919013232, 30919013204]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [72001110, 71901122, 71722015]; Research Fund for Young Teachers of School of Economics and Management, NJUST [JGQN2009]","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Fund for Young Teachers of School of Economics and Management, NJUST","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Number: 30919013232 to Y.

In order to reduce the block relay time, the delivery time between nodes must be measured and analyzed to find the cause of the delay and provide ways to resolve it. Therefore, in this paper, we measure the CBR time between directly connected Bitcoin nodes and analyze the cause of the relay delay. Our results show that the delivery time delay is affected by whether or not a transaction is requested when assembling the compact block.

We measure the Bitcoin transaction activity using trading volumes, the number of unique Bitcoin transactions, and the number of unique Bitcoin addresses. Considering the onset of structural breaks, we identify considerable effects of the heterogeneity concerning the quantiles of transaction activity, which cannot be depicted fully by the traditional quantile regression method. The empirical results show that higher transaction activity tends to predict higher/lower Bitcoin returns when the market is in a bullish/bearish state. We find that the nexus is asymmetric across quantiles, depending on the sign and size of the transaction activity, and the predictive relationship intensifies in the upper or lower quantiles of the conditional distribution. In addition, this empirical evidence is in line with the volume-return association in the equity market due to private informative and noninformative trading actions. Overall, our findings suggest that transaction activity-based strategies should be made with respect to Bitcoin market performance, specifically during extreme conditions.","[Hau, Liya; Sun, Wuqin] Zhejiang Univ, Ningbo Inst Technol, Ningbo 315100, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Huiming] Hunan Univ, Coll Business Adm, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China; [Shahbaz, Muhammad] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 10081, Peoples R China","Zhejiang University; Hunan University; Beijing Institute of Technology","Zhu, HM (corresponding author), Hunan Univ, Coll Business Adm, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China.","haoliya@nit.zju.edu.cn; zhuhuiming@hnu.edu.cn","","Hau, Liya/0000-0001-6256-5726","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71671062]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This research is partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under the Grant Number 71671062.","","40","8","8","5","20","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1062-9408","1879-0860","","N AM J ECON FINANC","N.

However, the P2P and pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin make transactions on this platform very difficult to track, thus triggering the emergence of various illegal activities in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Particularly, mixing services in Bitcoin, originally designed to enhance transaction anonymity, have been widely employed for money laundering to complicate the process of trailing illicit fund. In this article, we focus on the detection of the addresses belonging to mixing services, which is an important task for anti-money laundering in Bitcoin. Specifically, we provide a feature-based network analysis framework to identify statistical properties of mixing services from three levels, namely, network level, account level, and transaction level. To better characterize the transaction patterns of different types of addresses, we propose the concept of attributed temporal heterogeneous motifs (ATH motifs). Moreover, to deal with the issue of imperfect labeling, we tackle the mixing detection task as a positive and unlabeled learning (PU learning) problem and build a detection model by leveraging the considered features. Experiments on real Bitcoin datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our detection model and the importance of hybrid motifs including ATH motifs in mixing detection.","[Wu, Jiajing; Liu, Jieli; Chen, Weili; Huang, Huawei; Zheng, Zibin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yan] Univ Oslo, Dept Informat, N-0316 Oslo, Norway","Sun Yat Sen University; University of Oslo","Zheng, ZB (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.","wujiajing@mail.sysu.edu.cn; zhzibin@mail.sysu.edu.cn","Zheng, Zibin/HCH-2408-2022; Zheng, Zibin/E-3024-2014","Zheng, Zibin/0000-0002-7878-4330; Zheng, Zibin/0000-0002-7878-4330; Liu, Jieli/0000-0001-8158-3735","Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province [2018B010109001]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62032025, 61973325, U1811462]","Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","Manuscript received January 26, 2020; revised September 22, 2020; accepted December 29, 2020.

While Certificate Transparency logs help to detect falsified certificates in circulation, they do not address the prevailing issues with certificate revocation. Public blockchains such as Bitcoin can be used to create a transparent, tamper-proof log of events secured by the cryptographic work carried out by nodes in the network. In this paper, we present a Bitcoin-based certificate management system that exploits the scalability and low-cost features of its underlying blockchain infrastructure, while preserving user privacy. Based on a feasibility analysis, we estimate the capability to support 9000 certificate issuances, revocations, or updates per second at a cost of less than 0.005 USD per event. The immutability and auditability of records stored on the blockchain provides a universal view of public key certificates. A comparative analysis shows that our solution can significantly reduce the overhead endured by live certificate status retrievals and offers flexibility in certificate revocation. The revocation of a public key certificate is as simple as spending a Bitcoin transaction.","[Tartan, Chloe; Wright, Craig; Zhang, Wei] nChain Ltd, London, England; [Pettit, Michaella] nChain AG, Zug, Switzerland","","Tartan, C (corresponding author), nChain Ltd, London, England.","","","","","","","","44","0","0","1","2","SCITEPRESS","SETUBAL","AV D MANUELL, 27A 2 ESQ, SETUBAL, 2910-595, PORTUGAL","","","978-989-758-524-1","","","","2021","","","","","","","548","559","","10.5220/0010556805480559","http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0010556805480559","","","12","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS4LR","","hybrid","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000720102500050","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Design/methodology/approach First, this study tests if the Law of One Price (LOOP) is valid for bitcoin prices in Brazil, conducting tests with data from three Brazilian exchanges. Next, this study documents bitcoin price dynamics in the short run by studying the price discovery mechanism in these exchanges. This study uses Information Share and Component Share, combining the two measures to obtain an Information Leadership Share (ILS) measure. Findings This study finds a common trend within bitcoin prices among a set of exchanges, with cointegration tests between the price series indicating that LOOP is valid in Brazilian markets in the long run. ILS indicated that, for closing prices, the most liquid exchange (Foxbit) leads discovery, whereas the least liquid (Local Bitcoin) lags, with Mercado Bitcoin in the middle both in terms of discovery and liquidity. Finally, this study provides evidence that the price variation in the market that leads price discovery can be used to construct an arbitrage in another exchange. Originality/value This research brings the first evidence of a price discovery mechanism for exchanges in Brazilian Reais. Although LOOP is valid in the long run, price leadership in bitcoin markets potentially create arbitrage opportunities in the short run.

Unfortunately, their long-term adoption in the business world is imperiled by a lack of stability that manifests as dramatic swings in transaction fees and severe participant dissatisfaction. To date, there has been little academic effort to study how system participants react to volatility in fee movements. Our study addresses this research gap by conceptualizing the Bitcoin platform as a data space market and studying how market equilibrium forms between users who demand data space while trying to avoid transaction delays, and miners who supply data space while trying to maximize fee revenues. Our empirical analysis based on past bitcoin transactions reveals the existence of a relatively flat downward-sloping demand curve and a much steeper upward-sloping supply curve. Regarding users, the inelastic nature of demand signals the utility of Bitcoin as a niche platform for transactions that are otherwise difficult to conduct. This result challenges the belief that users may easily abandon Bitcoin technology given rising transaction costs. We also find that the use of bitcoins as a trading asset is associated with higher levels of tolerance to fees. Regarding miners, the comparatively elastic nature of supply indicates that higher fees stimulate mining by a larger magnitude than suppressing demand. This finding implies that, ceteris paribus, the Bitcoin system turns to self-regulate transaction fees in an efficient manner. Our work has implications for the management of congestion in blockchain-based systems and more broadly for the stability of cryptocurrency markets.","[Ilk, Noyan; Shang, Guangzhi] Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Fan, Shaokun] Oregon State Univ, Coll Business, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Zhao, J.

Moreover, the channels can also be used to route payments between two users who do not share a direct channel themselves. In this paper we study the topology of the Lightning Network in a given time period, performing a number of analysis on the channels and on the nodes composing the network. We study the churn rate, we evaluate centrality measurements and the clustering coefficient to evaluate the network connectivity, and finally we analyze the presence of a pattern that we named bouquet. The importance of this pattern is proven by the finding that, removing specific nodes of the bouquets (1% of the total) causes the disconnection from the largest component of about 41% nodes.","[Lisi, Andrea; Ricci, Laura] Univ Pisa, Pisa, Italy; [Lisi, Andrea; Mori, Paolo] CNR, IIT, Pisa, Italy; [Maesa, Damiano Di Francesco] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England","University of Pisa; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Informatica e Telematica (IIT-CNR); University of Cambridge","Lisi, A (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Pisa, Italy.;Lisi, A (corresponding author), CNR, IIT, Pisa, Italy.","andrea.lisi@phd.unipi.it; dd534@cam.ac.uk; paolo.mori@iit.cnr.it; laura.ricci@unipi.it","","Lisi, Andrea/0000-0002-4713-989X","","","","","12","0","0","2","5","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","0730-3157","","978-1-6654-2463-9","P INT COMP SOFTW APP","","","2021","","","","","","","324","331","","10.1109/COMPSAC51774.2021.00053","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/COMPSAC51774.2021.00053","","","8","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS2RI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000706529000042","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The results suggest a right-tail (high return) dependence between Bitcoin and the stock markets in the long term and that said dependence decreases significantly from yearly to monthly investment horizons. Furthermore, right-tail dependence between Bitcoin and the US stock market is the strongest compared with other stock markets. We also extract information on the time-varying and time?frequency structure of co-movements between Bitcoin and the stock markets using wavelet-coherence analysis, the results of which suggest that the co-movement between Bitcoin and the US stock market is positive, whereas, for other stock markets, it is negative at certain frequencies and time periods.

Although several studies have focussed on issues related to the energy consumption of the basic cryptocurrencies, an open question remains regarding the environmental depiction of Bitcoin. By resorting to Bayesian analysis and quantile cointegrated vector autoregression (CQVAR), this study seeks to disentangle the driving forces that shape the carbon footprint of Bitcoin. The sample used in the empirical analysis consists of a daily panel dataset covering 50 countries over the period 2016-2018. The empirical findings corroborate a causal effect between the use of Bitcoin and its underlying carbon dioxide emissions generated by the increasing energy load. The CQVAR is associated with positive marginal posterior means for most of the covariates of the model across all the estimated quantiles. In contrast, there is a negative and statistically significant relationship between Bitcoin miner's revenue and carbon emissions, uncovering a multimodal distribution pattern of the marginal posterior densities which is stronger at higher than in lower quantiles. This finding suggests that the lower (higher) miner's Bitcoin revenues, the more abrupt (gradual) the effect on environmental degradation. Therefore, a sustainable energy strategy focussing on the penetration of renewable energy sources along with the use of energy-efficient mining hardware will alleviate the carbon footprint of Bitcoin.","[Polemis, Michael L.] Univ Piraeus, Dept Econ, Piraeus 18534, Greece; [Polemis, Michael L.] Hellen Competit Commiss, Athens, Greece; [Tsionas, Mike G.] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Tsionas, Mike G.] Lancaster Univ Management Sch, Lancaster, England","University of Piraeus; Montpellier Business School","Polemis, ML (corresponding author), Univ Piraeus, Dept Econ, Piraeus 18534, Greece.;Polemis, ML (corresponding author), Hellen Competit Commiss, Athens, Greece.","mpolemis@unipi.gr","Polemis, Michael/AAM-7918-2021","POLEMIS, MICHAEL/0000-0003-2223-0547","","","","","61","8","8","15","54","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1076-9307","1099-1158","","INT J FINANC ECON","Int.

Empirical investigations are executed through symmetric, asymmetric and non-linear causality tests, and Markov regime-switching regression (MRSR) analysis. Results show that Bitcoin has a causal nexus with Chinese yuan and Indian rupee for price and various return components. The MRSR analysis justifies these findings by demonstrating the presence of interaction in contractionary regimes. Accordingly, it can be stated that when markets display a downward trend, appreciation of the Chinese yuan and Indian rupee positively and strongly affects the value of Bitcoin, possibly due to the market timing. The MRSR analysis also exhibits a transition from a tranquil to a crisis regime in March 2020 because of the pandemic. However, a shorter duration spent in the crisis regime in 2020 indicates the limited and relatively less harmful effect of the pandemic on the cryptocurrency market when compared to the turmoil that occurred in 2018.","[Gunay, Samet; Muhammed, Shahnawaz] Amer Univ Middle East, Coll Business Adm, Egaila 15453, Kuwait; [Kaskaloglu, Kerem] Amer Univ Middle East, Coll Engn & Technol, Egaila 15453, Kuwait","American University of Middle East; American University of Middle East","Gunay, S (corresponding author), Amer Univ Middle East, Coll Business Adm, Egaila 15453, Kuwait.","samet.gunay@aum.edu.kw; kerem.kaskaloglu@aum.edu.kw; shahnawaz.muhammed@aum.edu.kw","Gunay, Samet/HDN-4467-2022","Muhammed, Shahnawaz/0000-0002-6031-5376","","","","","79","0","0","3","10","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-7390","","MATHEMATICS-BASEL","Mathematics","JUN","2021","9","12","","","","","","","1395","10.3390/math9121395","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math9121395","","","18","Mathematics","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Mathematics","TA6PJ","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000667370200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Through comparing the relationship between the returns of Bitcoin (in terms of the US Dollar, Korean Won, and Euro) and high-performance technology stocks, with a range of global stock markets, we investigate whether there is any evidence of potential hedging and diversification properties and whether these are conditional on the states of the respective markets. We implement a quantile-on-quantile regression method to examine the relationship between both Bitcoin returns and technology stock returns, and stock market returns at varying quantiles. Our results show that although Bitcoin and high-performance technology stocks arguably share many similarities, it is clear that Bitcoin exhibits significant differences compared with high-performance technology stocks in terms of the diversification properties against global stock markets. With respect to the US stock markets, Bitcoin appears to be a consistent hedge when it is in a bullish state, however, there is some divergence in the relationships in relation to the European and Asian stock markets. In particular, Bitcoin (in terms of the Korean Won) may act as a safe haven against Asian stock markets when both are in a bearish state, although there does not appear to be strong and consistent evidence of this safe haven property across all Bitcoin returns and stock markets. From a financial perspective, this may suggest that individuals do not see and treat Bitcoin as a technology (or a technology company), but rather further supports the view of Bitcoin as a potential investment for financial gain (given its diversification properties).

Bitcoin-NG has a special incentive mechanism (i.e., splitting transaction fees to the current and the next leader) to maintain its security. However, this incentive mechanism ignores the joint effect of transaction fees, mint coins, and mining duration lengths on the expected mining reward. In this article, we identify the advanced mining attack that deliberately ignores microblocks to enlarge the mining-duration length to increase the likelihood of winning the mining race. We first show that an advanced mining attacker can maximize its expected reward by optimizing its mining-duration length. We then formulate a game-theoretical model in which multiple mining players perform advanced mining to compete with each other. We analyze the Nash equilibrium for the mining game. Our analytical and simulation results indicate that all mining players in the mining game converge to having advanced mining at the equilibrium and have no incentives for deviating from the equilibrium; the transaction processing capability of Bitcoin-NG at the equilibrium is decreased by advanced mining. Therefore, we conclude that the Bitcoin-NG blockchain protocol is vulnerable to advanced mining.","[Wang, Taotao; Bai, Xiaoqian; Zhang, Shengli] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hao] Monash Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Dept Data Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Liew, Soung Chang] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Informat Engn, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China","Shenzhen University; Monash University; Chinese University of Hong Kong","Zhang, SL (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.","ttwang@szu.edu.cn; baixiaoqian_szu@163.com; haowang.sjtu@gmail.com; soung@ie.cuhk.edu.hk; zsl@szu.edu.cn","","Zhang, Shengli/0000-0002-7937-5870; Wang, Hao/0000-0001-5182-7938; Liew, Soung Chang/0000-0001-7055-6483","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFB2100705]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61701311, 61771315]; Guangdong NSF Project [2017A030310334]; Natural Science Foundation of Shenzhen [JCYJ20170818095107583]; China Academy of Space Technology (CAST)","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong NSF Project; Natural Science Foundation of Shenzhen; China Academy of Space Technology (CAST)(Chinese Academy of Sciences)","This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China underGrant 2018YFB2100705, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 61701311 and 61771315, in part by the Guangdong NSF Project under Grant 2017A030310334, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Shenzhen under Grant JCYJ20170818095107583, and in part by a grant from the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST).","","23","3","3","3","16","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","1932-8184","1937-9234","","IEEE SYST J","IEEE Syst.

The anonymity, however, also attracts the usage of cryptocurrency by criminals in ransomware and money laundering, and limits its further application and development. In this paper, we aim to improve Bitcoin's auditability with de-anonymization. Many previous studies have used heuristic clustering or supervised machine learning to analyze the historical transactions for identifying user behaviors. However, heuristic clustering only considers the topological structure of the transaction graph and ignores the transaction attributes. While supervised learning is usually limited by the size of labeled datasets, resulting in an unsatisfactory accuracy. To resolve the above problems, we propose an Adaptive Weighted Attribute Propagation enhanced community detection model, named AWAP, which considers both the transaction's topological structure and the transaction attributes. We first parse the transaction data from the public ledger and construct a bipartite graph to describe correlations between addresses and transactions. Then, we use a five-step feature engineering pipeline to extract Bitcoin address attributes and build an attribute graph. Finally, we design an adaptive weighted attribute propagation algorithm running on the attribute graph to classify the Bitcoin addresses and identify user behaviors. Extensive experiments highlight that AWAP model achieves 12% higher accuracy and 25% higher F-score on average, compared to the state-of-the-art Bitcoin address classifiers and other community detection algorithms. To evaluate the effectiveness of AWAP, we also present two case studies on Bitcoin address classification and Bitcoin trace-ability in ransomware. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Using data from Apple mobility trends and several time-series econometric models, we find that investors became active participants during the COVID-19 pandemic period and traded more bitcoins on days with low mobility associated with lockdown mandates. These results remain robust after controlling for stocks and gold returns, the VIX index, and the level of attention and sentiment toward Bitcoin, as measured by Google search frequencies and the tone of Tweets discussing Bitcoin. These results suggest that when individual investors have ample free time on their hands, they trade cryptocurrencies as a pastime and use the Bitcoin market as a form of entertainment. Moreover, our results have important implications concerning investors' herding behavior and overconfidence leading to noise trader risks and bubbles typically accompanied by high trading volume in cryptocurrency markets.","[Guzman, Alexander; Trujillo, Maria-Andrea] CESA Sch Business, Bogota 110311, Colombia; [Pinto-Gutierrez, Christian] Univ Talca, Fac Business & Econ, Talca 3460000, Chile","Universidad de Talca","Pinto-Gutierrez, C (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Fac Business & Econ, Talca 3460000, Chile.","alexander.guzman@cesa.edu.co; cristian.pinto@utalca.cl; maria.trujillo@cesa.edu.co","Pinto-Gutierrez, Christian/GXF-4273-2022","Guzman, Alexander/0000-0001-7675-048X; Pinto-Gutierrez, Christian/0000-0002-7981-4968; Trujillo, Maria-Andrea/0000-0002-9592-7890","","","","","58","9","9","4","15","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-7390","","MATHEMATICS-BASEL","Mathematics","AUG","2021","9","15","","","","","","","1771","10.3390/math9151771","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math9151771","","","15","Mathematics","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Mathematics","TV9NG","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000682040100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Using time series of Bitcoin-related tweets, the Bitcoin trade volume, and the Bitcoin bid-ask spread, as external information signals, we test for improvement in volatility prediction of several GARCH model variants on a minute-level Bitcoin price time series.

Amidst all this, Bitcoin also emerged on the surface of the financial markets in 2008, as one of the biggest innovations of our century. However, since then, it has largely been scrutinized for the benefits and risks that it puts forth in terms of the economic growth, financial system's stability and the welfare of overall society. In this study, we evaluate how the financial industry can use Bitcoin for improving the efficiency and wealth of the society, by focusing on portfolio optimization. Our results show that Bitcoin has an enormous tendency to improve an investor's risk-return profile. This efficiency is clearly visible in the upward shifts of the efficient frontiers, once Bitcoin is added in the universe of investable assets. Bitcoin's efficiency is valid for when the short selling was, and, was not restricted. It is important to note that our findings are based on the data that spans over a timeframe of a decade, and provides a medium to long term perspective on Bitcoin, which was not the case with the earlier studies.","[Li, Jing-Ping] Shanxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Taiyuan, Peoples R China; [Naqvi, Bushra] Lahore Univ Management Sci, Suleman Dawood Sch Business, Lahore, Pakistan; [Rizvi, Syed Kumail Abbas] Lahore Sch Econ, Fac Business Adm, Lahore, Pakistan; [Chang, Hsu-Ling] Ling Tung Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat, Taichung, Taiwan","Shanxi University Finance & Economics; Lahore University of Management Sciences; Lahore School of Economics","Chang, HL (corresponding author), Ling Tung Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat, Taichung, Taiwan.","jingboh@126.com; bushra.naqvi@lums.edu.pk; kumail@lahoreschool.edu.pk; hsulingchang@yahoo.com.tw","Rizvi, Syed Kumail Abbas/AAR-2381-2021","Rizvi, Syed Kumail Abbas/0000-0003-1246-0912","Fund Program for the Scientific Activities of the Selected Returned Overseas Professionals in Shanxi Province [2017-1389]; Shanxi Scholarship Council of China [2017-100]","Fund Program for the Scientific Activities of the Selected Returned Overseas Professionals in Shanxi Province; Shanxi Scholarship Council of China","This work is supported by the Fund Program for the Scientific Activities of the Selected Returned Overseas Professionals in Shanxi Province, in 2017 (Grant No. 2017-1389) and the Research Project Supported by Shanxi Scholarship Council of China in 2017 (Grant No. 2017-100).","","33","18","19","4","19","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","0040-1625","1873-5509","","TECHNOL FORECAST SOC","Technol.

Taking the Google search volume index as the measure of internet attention, time-varying Granger causality between the global Bitcoin market and internet attention is examined. Empirical results show a strong Granger causal relationship between internet attention and trading volume. Moreover, they indicate, beginning in early 2018, an even stronger impact of trading volume on internet attention, which is consistent with the rapid increase in Bitcoin users following the 2017 Bitcoin bubble. Although Bitcoin returns are found to strongly affect internet attention, internet attention only occasionally affects Bitcoin returns. Further investigation reveals that interactions between internet attention and returns can be amplified by extreme changes in prices, and internet attention is more likely to lead to returns during Bitcoin bubbles. These empirical findings shed light on cryptocurrency investor attention theory and imply trading strategy in Bitcoin markets.","[Zhang, Xun; Lu, Fengbin; Tao, Rui; Wang, Shouyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, MADIS, CEFS, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences","Zhang, X (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, MADIS, CEFS, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.","zhangxun@amss.ac.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71422015, 71871213]; National Center for Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Center for Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences","The paper received financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71422015, 71871213) and the National Center for Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","","44","3","3","10","20","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","2199-4730","","FINANC INNOV","Financ.

This article presents a novel approach to developing a Bitcoin transaction forecast model, DLForecast, by leveraging deep neural networks for learning Bitcoin transaction network representations. DLForecast makes three original contributions. First, we explore three interesting properties between Bitcoin transaction accounts: topological connectivity pattern of Bitcoin accounts, transaction amount pattern, and transaction dynamics. Second, we construct a time-decaying reachability graph and a time-decaying transaction pattern graph, aiming at capturing different types of spatial-temporal Bitcoin transaction patterns. Third, we employ node embedding on both graphs and develop a Bitcoin transaction forecasting system between user accounts based on historical transactions with built-in time-decaying factor. To maintain an effective transaction forecasting performance, we leverage the multiplicative model update (MMU) ensemble to combine prediction models built on different transaction features extracted from each corresponding Bitcoin transaction graph. Evaluated on real-world Bitcoin transaction data, we show that our spatial-temporal forecasting model is efficient with fast runtime and effective with forecasting accuracy over 60 percent and improves the prediction performance by 50 percent when compared to forecasting model built on the static graph baseline.","[Wei, Wenqi; Liu, Ling] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Zhang, Qi] IBM TJ Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA","University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; International Business Machines (IBM)","Wei, WQ (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.","wenqiwei@gatech.edu; q.zhang@ibm.com; ling.liu@cc.gatech.edu","Wei, Wenqi/AAF-4752-2020","Wei, Wenqi/0000-0001-9177-114X","NSF CISE grant [1564097]; IBM faculty award","NSF CISE grant; IBM faculty award(International Business Machines (IBM))","The first author thanks the opportunity of the 12-week working experience at IBM T.

To address this limitation, this paper investigates the causality running from EPU to Bitcoin returns and volatility in the top-10 countries running Bitcoin nodes under different market conditions. To do so, we employ the symmetric and asymmetric causality in-quantiles test. Results report that the EPU improves the prediction of Bitcoin returns in the majority of countries under extreme market conditions. However, the EPU causes Bitcoin volatility at the intermediate and high quantiles. Further analysis considering the asymmetric causality in quantiles suggests that the causality running from EPU to the Bitcoin returns is sourced from increased EPU levels (positive variations), while the decrease in EPU (negative variations) is the source of causality from EPU to Bitcoin volatility. Our results have important implications for investors and policymakers operating in the cryptocurrency market, particularly in portfolio design and risk management.

The model is a two-stage Stackelberg game in which each stage forms a sub-game. In stage I, pools are the leaders who assign a computing power to be consumed by miners. In stage II, miners decide of their power consumption and distribution. They find themselves in a social dilemma in which they must choose between mining in solo, therefore prioritizing their individual preferences, and participating in a pool for the collective interest. The model relies on a pool protocol based on a simulated game in which the miners compete for the reward won by the pool. The solutions for the stage I sub-game and the simulated protocol game are unique and stable Nash equilibriums while the stage II sub-game leads to a stable cooperative equilibrium only when miners choose their strategies according to certain criteria. We conclude that the cooperative optimal mining model has the potential to favor Bitcoin decentralization and stability. Mainly, the social dilemma faced by miners together with the balance of incentives ensure a certain distribution of the network computing power between pools and solo miners, while equilibriums in the game solutions provide stability to the system.","[Lajeunesse, David; Scolnikt, Hugo D.] Univ Buenos Aires, Informat Secur, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Scolnikt, Hugo D.] Univ Buenos Aires, Dept Comp Sci, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Scolnikt, Hugo D.] Univ Buenos Aires, ICC, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","University of Buenos Aires; University of Buenos Aires; University of Buenos Aires","Lajeunesse, D (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Informat Secur, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.","davidlajeunesse1@gmail.com; hscolnik@gmail.com","","","","","","","20","0","0","1","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-3924-4","","","","2021","","","","","","","209","216","","10.1109/BRAINS52497.2021.9569832","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BRAINS52497.2021.9569832","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7HN","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000848640500047","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The empirical results, applied on major world stock market indices and currencies, and based on the multivariate asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation model, show the effectiveness of Bitcoin and gold as hedging assets in reducing the risk of international portfolios. Moreover, the analysis provides evidence that during the COVID-19 pandemic, gold is a weak safe haven for the considered assets, while Bitcoin cannot provide shelter due to its increased variability.

While nodes in this network are known, the connections among them are kept hidden, as it is commonly believed that this helps protect from deanonymization and low-level attacks. However, adversaries can bypass this limitation by inferring connections through side channels. At the same time, the lack of topology information hinders the analysis of the network, which is essential to improve efficiency and security. In this paper, we thoroughly review network-level attacks and empirically show that topology obfuscation is not an effective countermeasure. We then argue that the benefits of an open topology potentially outweigh its risks, and propose a protocol to reliably infer and monitor connections among reachable nodes of the Bitcoin network. We formally analyze our protocol and experimentally evaluate its accuracy in both trusted and untrusted settings.

Its underlying protocol defines how transactions and blocks are distributed through all participating nodes. To protect user privacy, the identity of the node originating a message is kept hidden. However, an adversary observing the whole network can analyze the spread pattern of a transaction to trace it back to its source. This is possible thanks to the so-called rumor centrality, which is caused by the symmetry in the spreading of gossip-like protocols. Recent works try to address this issue by breaking the symmetry of the Diffusion protocol, currently used in Bitcoin, and leveraging proxied broadcast. Nonetheless, the complexity of their design can be a barrier to their adoption in real life. In this work, we propose Clover, a novel transaction relay protocol that protects the source of transaction messages with a simple, yet effective, design. Compared to previous solutions, our protocol does not require building propagation graphs, and reduces the ability of the adversary to gain precision by opening multiple connections towards the same node. Experimental results show that the deanonymization accuracy of an eavesdropper adversary against Clover is up to 10 times smaller compared to Diffusion.","[Franzoni, Federico; Daza, Vanesa] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Informat & Commun Engn, Roc Boronat 138, Barcelona 08018, Spain","Pompeu Fabra University","Franzoni, F (corresponding author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Informat & Commun Engn, Roc Boronat 138, Barcelona 08018, Spain.","fed.franzoni@gmail.com; vanesa.daza@upf.edu","","Franzoni, FEDERICO/0000-0001-6697-5431","CRUE-CSIC; Springer Nature","CRUE-CSIC; Springer Nature","Open Access funding provided thanks to the CRUE-CSIC agreement with Springer Nature.","","22","0","0","6","15","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1936-6442","1936-6450","","PEER PEER NETW APPL","Peer Peer Netw.

Both quantitative and qualitative methods, including a one-way analysis of variance, a paired t-test, a simple regression analysis, and an in-depth interview, were employed. One of the conclusions implies that tourists in a tourism destination still prefer paying with cash rather than paying with card or virtual currency. Moreover, the study discovered that tourists count more on virtual currency and prepare for a future with virtual currency when a factor that has an unstable impact on social economy, such as COVID-19, happens. As to the functions of Bitcoin, tourists appeared to place a great importance on its storage, value, satisfaction, convenience, and investment.

This research employed the augmented Dickey-Fuller test to check the stationarity of data, the co-integration test for the interdependency of variables, and the vector error correction model for identifying the direction and long or short-run relationship between Bitcoin prices and COVID-19. The research results show that Bitcoin prices are negatively significant and related to COVID-19 in the short-run. A unidirectional relationship between Bitcoin prices and cumulative deaths is also observed. Investors and the public's psychological state were positively significant to Bitcoin prices in the long-term because of cashless transactions, unbanked, and less risky virus traveling. The second reason behind the positive psychological relation is un-centralization and easy-to-make payments by Bitcoin.

However, in the past, there have been few measurement studies on measuring and comparing the actual level of decentralization between existing blockchains using multiple metrics and granularities. This paper presents a new comparison study of the degree of decentralization in Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two most prominent blockchains, with various decentralization metrics and different granularities within the time dimension. Specifically, we measure the degree of decentralization in the two blockchains during 2019 by computing the distribution of mining power with three metrics (Gini coefficient, Shannon entropy, and Nakamoto coefficient) as well as three granularities (days, weeks, and months). Our measurement results with different metrics and granularities reveal the same trend that, compared with each other, the degree of decentralization in Bitcoin is higher, while the degree of decentralization in Ethereum is more stable. To obtain the cross-interval information missed in the fixed window based measurements, we propose the sliding window based measurement approach. The corresponding results demonstrate that the use of sliding windows could reveal additional cross-interval information overlooked by the fixed window based measurements, thus enhancing the effectiveness of measuring decentralization in terms of continuous trends and abnormal situations. We believe that the methodologies and findings in this paper can facilitate future studies of decentralization in blockchains.","[Lin, Qinwei; Li, Chao; Zhao, Xifeng; Chen, Xianhai] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Chao] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing Key Lab Secur & Privacy Intelligent Trans, Beijing, Peoples R China","Beijing Jiaotong University; Beijing Jiaotong University","Li, C (corresponding author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Li, C (corresponding author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing Key Lab Secur & Privacy Intelligent Trans, Beijing, Peoples R China.","li.chao@bjtu.edu.cn","","","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2019RC038]","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","The work in this paper is supported by Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2019RC038).

Consequently, investors feel pressured to find safe-haven investments during the pandemic crisis. Numerous studies have evaluated bitcoin's safe-haven properties during the COVID-19; however, the present study considered gold as a potential safe-haven for investors of renowned stock markets of Asia, Europe, and the US. The present investigation computed the ratio of gold to bitcoin (Gold_Bitcoin) and compared the safe-haven properties of gold in contrast to bitcoin. The present study analysed the Morlet Wavelet approach and found that most of the time during the COVID-19, gold investments proved to be more beneficial than bitcoin. Remarkably, the findings highlighted that the Gold_Bitcoin ratio increased in higher and lower frequencies combined with CAC40. In the long run, the return on investments in gold increased in contrast to bitcoin returns pooled with DAX30. Also, the Gold_Bitcoin ratio of the US stock market increased during the one-week and one-month cycles of January and August. Likewise, the Hang Seng Index caused the Gold_Bitcoin ratio to rise at a much higher frequency (i.e., the second half of January, the first half of February and April, and the first half of June and August), whereas IBEX35 surged Gold_Bitcoin at a lower frequency (i.e., during January, February, and August). In higher frequency bands, LSE increased the Gold_Bitcoin ratio (i.e., in February and March); nevertheless, Gold_Bitcoin showed a positive connection with FTSEMIB in the one-to-two month's frequency band (i.e., throughout January, February, and August). Interestingly, the returns on the Gold_Bitcoin ratio increased in the SSEC stock market in the high-frequency band (i.e., during March, May, and July 2020).","[Shehzad, Khurram] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China; [Bilgili, Faik; Kocak, Emrah] Erciyes Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, Kayseri, Turkey; [Zaman, Umer] Woosong Univ, Endicott Coll Int Studies, Daejeon, South Korea; [Kuskaya, Sevda] Erciyes Univ, Justice Vocat Coll, TR-38039 Kayseri, Turkey","Southeast University - China; Erciyes University; Woosong University; Erciyes University","Shehzad, K (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China.","233189917@seu.edu.cn; fbilgili@erciyes.edu.tr; umerzaman@endicott.ac.tr; emrahkocak@erciyes.edu.tr; skuskaya@erciyes.edu.tr","Bilgili, Faik/F-4695-2015; Shehzad, Khurram/AAX-1290-2020; koçak, emrah/U-1052-2019; Kuskaya, Sevda/I-6926-2019; Zaman, Umer/AAD-5227-2021","Bilgili, Faik/0000-0003-4138-6897; Shehzad, Khurram/0000-0001-7835-5264; koçak, emrah/0000-0002-5889-3126; Kuskaya, Sevda/0000-0003-4527-5713; Zaman, Umer/0000-0002-3729-3543","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673043]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The study is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.71673043).","","47","16","16","3","36","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0301-4207","1873-7641","","RESOUR POLICY","Resour.

However, there is lack of research handling cryptocurrencies in a mainstream macroeconomic model. To bridge the gap, we develop a model for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency as risky and costly bubbles in an infinite-horizon production economy. This model is consistent with the following facts: (1) the surging Bitcoin market presents enormous volatility, (2) its price dynamics are significantly sensitive to both market sentiment and policy stances. Entrepreneurial firms choose to hold Bitcoins as liquid assets to buffer idiosyncratic investment distortions. The intrinsically worthless Bitcoins can emerge as rational bubbles when the market sentiment is optimistic enough. On the one hand, bubbly Bitcoins provide market liquidity to facilitate investment in the real sector, while on the other hand, they deteriorate the investment efficiency and crowd out aggregate production. Our quantitative exercise produces various cyclical features of Bitcoin bubbles and find that the collapse of Bitcoin bubbles can improve social welfare by decreasing distortion-driven real investment.","[Dong, Feng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zhiwei] Peking Univ HSBC Business Sch, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yu] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing, Peoples R China","Tsinghua University; Peking University","Xu, ZW (corresponding author), Peking Univ HSBC Business Sch, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.","dongfeng@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn; xuzhiwei09@gmail.com; yuzhang@gsm.pku.edu.cn","","Dong, Feng/0000-0001-5085-2277; Xu, Zhiwei/0000-0002-6591-4183","National Natural Science Foundation of China [72122011, 72022011, 71903126]; Guanghua Blockchain Lab; Guanghua Research Fund on FinTech","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guanghua Blockchain Lab; Guanghua Research Fund on FinTech","We would like to thank the Editor, the Associate Editor, three anonymous referees, Redouane Elkamhi, Laura Xiaolei Liu, Vincenzo Quadrini, Baolian Wang, Pengfei Wang, Ji Zhang (discussant), Xiaodong Zhu and Yifeng Zhu and the seminar participants at the First Macro-Finance Workshop at Peking University HSBC Business School, Central University of Finance and Economics, and Peking University for their useful discussions and comments.

In this regard it should be added that few studies consider trust as a determinant of the use of Bitcoin; therefore, the purpose of this research is to know what are the factors on which trust is based and to know to what extent the perceived risk has a negative connotation on the use of cryptocurrency. To accomplish this, a model is integrated and is analyzed under the methodology of structural equations by partial least squares (PLS-SEM), applied to a sample of 174 bitcoin users. The evaluation of the seven theoretical hypotheses indicates that the key elements of trust are structural guarantees and familiarity since they determine the intention of use and this, in turn, the actual use; unlike calculative-based trust and situational normality, which are not very significant. The perceived risk was shown to have little relation to the intended use. Therefore, Bitcoin-related service providers should focus on generating trust situations for users based on security and regulations and creating environments that generate familiarity.","[Lopez-Zambrano, Carlos Roberto] Ctr Invest Alimentac & Desarrollo, Desarrollo Reg, Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico; [Camberos-Castro, Mario] Ctr Invest Alimentac & Desarrollo, Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico; [Villarreal-Peralta, Edna Maria] Univ Sonora, Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico","CIAD - Centro de Investigacion en Alimentacion y Desarrollo; CIAD - Centro de Investigacion en Alimentacion y Desarrollo; Universidad de Sonora","Lopez-Zambrano, CR (corresponding author), Ctr Invest Alimentac & Desarrollo, Desarrollo Reg, Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico.","carlos.lopezdr18@estudiantes.ciad.mx; mcamberos@ciad.mx; edna.villarreal@uni-son.mx","","","","","","","45","0","0","3","20","UNIV POLITECNICA SALESIANA ECUADOR-SALESIAN POLYTECNIC UNIV","CUENCA","CALLE TURUHUAYO 3-69 & CALLE VIEJA, CUENCA, 00000, ECUADOR","1390-6291","1390-8618","","RETOS-REV CIENC ADM","Retos","OCT-MAR","2021","11","22","","","","","199","215","","10.17163/ret.n22.2021.01","http://dx.doi.org/10.17163/ret.n22.2021.01","","","17","Economics","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Business & Economics","XL1ZF","","Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000727948700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It is therefore imperative to have high p2p connectivity for the quality of the blockchain system operations. High p2p networking connectivity ensures that a peer node is connected to multiple other peers providing a diverse set of observers of the current state of the blockchain and transactions. However, in a permissionless blockchain network, using the peer identifiers-including the current approach of counting the number of distinct IP addresses and port numbers-can be ineffective in measuring the number of peer connections and estimating the networking connectivity. Such current approach is further challenged by the networking threats manipulating the identifiers. We build a robust estimation engine for the p2p networking connectivity by sensing and processing the p2p networking traffic. We implement a working Bitcoin prototype connected to the Bitcoin Mainnet to validate and improve our engine's performances and evaluate the estimation accuracy and cost efficiency of our estimation engine.","[Hong, Hsiang-Jen; Fan, Wenjun; Wuthier, Simeon; Zhou, Xiaobo; Chow, C.

Based on their characteristics, we classify them into user, miner, exchange activities and run a correlation analysis with the price to understand the dynamics of bitcoin's price and its underlying mechanics. Using the correlated data, we develop a deep learning model. However, determining the best values of parameters in a deep learning model can be a very challenging and time-consuming task. Hence, we propose a self-adaptive technique using a jSO optimization algorithm to find the best values of these parameters to accurately predict the price of bitcoin.

For this, an interchangeable and fractionable account unit called bitcoin is used. The main characteristic of this system is that it does not need a central unit to administer it, it works through an incentive system that ensures that a series of users called miners act in such a way that transactions can be carried out safely. Basically, these miners compete with each other to add new transactions to the ledger, for which they must solve a mathematical problem established by the system. To do so, they must consume some resources (computer hardware, electricity, etc.) with which they generate a processing power to solve the mathematical problem. As payment for the expense that the miners make, they receive a reward in the form of new mined bitcoins and users' commissions. It is a necessary condition for the network to be secure that the mining activity remains decentralized. However, recent years have seen an increase in the concentration of processing power. Given the importance of this issue for cryptocurrency, this work has tried to understand what the reasons for the concentration have been and if they can be considered as trends that will continue to operate in the long term. The study concludes that the reduction in miners' rewards and economies of scale have been the main causes of concentration and that at least the first of these causes will continue to operate in the long term.","[Llases, Luis] Univ Valladolid, Grp Energia Econ & Dinam Sistemas, Valladolid, Spain","Universidad de Valladolid","Llases, L (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Grp Energia Econ & Dinam Sistemas, Valladolid, Spain.","llasesluis@gmail.com","","","","","","","21","0","0","0","0","UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, SERVICIO PUBLICACIONES","MADRID","CIUDAD UNIV, OBISPO TREJO 3, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN","1989-5917","","","PAPELES EUR","Papeles Eur.","","2021","34","1","","","","","29","39","","10.5209/pade.73881","http://dx.doi.org/10.5209/pade.73881","","","11","Area Studies","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Area Studies","1G9SL","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000796187200003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Since its inception, in a short period of time Bitcoin got wide popularity and considered as an investment asset. At present it is the most successful cryptocurrency compared to other altcoins dispersed in the world economy. The Bitcoin prices fluctuate like other stock markets due to inherent volatility. The investors' confidence on Bitcoin rising fast and have been reflected on its prices. Though few computational intelligence methods are available, sophisticated methodologies for accurate prediction of Bitcoin are still lacking and need to be explored. Functional link neural network (FLN) is a flat network, offers lower computational complexity, and achieves enhanced input-output nonlinearity mapping through functional expansion of input signals. Basis functions such as Legendre, Trigonometric, Laguerre, and Chebyshev are commonly used polynomials in FLN for expansion of input signal dimension. In this article along with the weight and bias vector of FLNs, optimal number of polynomial functions for each category of basis function is selected by genetic algorithm during training process rather fixing them earlier. Therefore, an optimal FLN structure is crafted on fly from exploitation of training data. The optimal FLN models are used to predict the daily, weekly, and monthly closing prices of Bitcoin. A comparative study among optimal FLNs is carried out using evaluation metrics such as MAPE, NMSE, ARV, and U of Theil's statistics. Finally, outcomes from experimental and comparative studies suggested the superiority of optimal FLN models for Bitcoin closing price prediction.","[Nayak, Sarat Chandra] CMR Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Hyderabad 501401, India","","Nayak, SC (corresponding author), CMR Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Hyderabad 501401, India.","saratnayak234@gmail.com","","","","","","","65","1","1","4","10","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","1864-5909","1864-5917","","EVOL INTELL","Evol.

"J","Zhou, SW","","","","Zhou, Siwen","","","Exploring the driving forces of the Bitcoin currency exchange rate dynamics: an EGARCH approach","EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS","","","English","Article","","","","","","Bitcoin; EGARCH; Event analysis; Reuters news; Financial markets","","Bitcoin is a virtual currency scheme that is characterised by a decentralised network and cryptographic transfer verification. It has attracted much public attention due to its innovative technology and its high currency exchange rate volatility. In this paper, Bitcoin's exchange rate movement from 2011 to 2018 and its relationship with the global financial markets are explored using an EGARCH framework. The results are as follows. First, fundamentals and Bitcoin-related specific events play a critical role in the formation of its exchange rate. Second, the impact on Bitcoin of regulation-related events indicates that market sentiment responds to market regulation statements. Third, news coverage is an essential factor in driving its volatility. Fourth, Bitcoin can be a hedge in times of low uncertainty in global financial markets and can also serve as a safe haven against high economic uncertainty worldwide, but with increasing global financial uncertainty, it is likely to move with the markets and therefore cannot serve as a hedge or safe haven against stock market crashes. Lastly, the positive effect of global expansionary monetary policy on Bitcoin's exchange rate is marginal enough to rule out the involvement of central banks worldwide in the inflation of Bitcoin's exchange rate over the years, as may have been the case with many asset prices after the 2008 US financial crisis.","[Zhou, Siwen] Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany","University of Hamburg","Zhou, SW (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.","swn.zhou@gmail.com","","","","","","","115","4","4","4","19","PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO","HEIDELBERG","PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","0377-7332","1435-8921","","EMPIR ECON","Empir.

To circumvent the lag specification uncertainty, we introduce a new model averaging coefficient estimator with the mean squared error of the coefficient to be minimized. We show that the averaged coefficient vector has a root -n consistency with n being the sample size and propose using a double bootstrap to provide inference. Monte Carlo simulation results demonstrate reliability of the proposed method. The in-sample application shows that adjustment for measurement errors by HARQ-type models is necessary. The model averaging estimator has higher in-sample explanatory power with more significant predictors. The out-of-sample outcomes reveal that the forecast horizon plays a key role at determining the effectiveness of signed realized variance for predicting the Bitcoin volatility.

The results indicate that faced with shocks of different uncertainties, Bitcoin is unable to serve as a safe-haven, while gold can hedge against uncertainties to varying degrees. Moreover, the three types of uncertainties have asymmetric impacts on the prices of Bitcoin and gold respectively. The decrease of uncertainties has a greater impact on Bitcoin price than the increase, while the increase of uncertainties has a greater impact on gold price than the decrease. It suggests that investors are cautious and optimistic about Bitcoin, and gold remains unanimously recognized as the traditional safe-haven.","[Long, Shaobo] Chongqing Univ, Res Ctr Publ Econ & Publ Policy, 174 Shazheng St, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Long, Shaobo; Pei, Hongxia; Tian, Hao] Chongqing Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, 174 Shazheng St, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Lang, Kun] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 30 Shuangqing Rd, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Chongqing University; Chongqing University; Tsinghua University","Long, SB (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Res Ctr Publ Econ & Publ Policy, 174 Shazheng St, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China.","longshbcqu@126.com","","Long, Shaobo/0000-0003-4549-8722; Lang, Kun/0000-0002-4205-3616","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2021CDJSKJC04, 2019CDSKXYGG0042]","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This work is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant number (2021CDJSKJC04; 2019CDSKXYGG0042) .","","46","7","7","16","42","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1057-5219","1873-8079","","INT REV FINANC ANAL","Int.

The following methods are applied for the analysis: the spillover index method of Diebold and Yilmaz (Int J Forecast 28(1): 57-66, 2012. ), the spillover asymmetry measures of Barunik et al. (J Int Money Finance 77: 39-56, 2017. ), and the frequency connectedness method of Barunik and Krehlik (J Financ Econom 16(2): 271-296, 2018. ). The findings identify the presence of low-level integration and asymmetric volatility spillover as well as a dominant role of short horizon spillover among Bitcoin markets and foreign exchange pairs for six major trading currencies (US dollar, euro, Japanese yen, British pound sterling, Australian dollar, and Canadian dollar). Bitcoin is found to provide significant portfolio diversification benefits for alternative currency foreign exchange portfolios. Alternative currency Bitcoin trading in euro is found to provide the most significant portfolio diversification benefits for foreign exchange portfolios consisting of major trading currencies. The findings of the study regarding spillover dynamics and portfolio diversification capabilities of the Bitcoin market for foreign exchange markets of major trading currencies have significant implications for portfolio diversification and risk minimization.","[Qarni, Muhammad Owais; Gulzar, Saiqb] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Wah Campus, Wah Cantt, Punjab, Pakistan","COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI)","Gulzar, S (corresponding author), COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Wah Campus, Wah Cantt, Punjab, Pakistan.","saqibgulzar@ciitwah.edu.pk","Gulzar, Saqib/AAG-9095-2020; Qarni, Dr. Muhammad Owais/GNW-6301-2022","Gulzar, Saqib/0000-0002-0352-5801; Qarni, Dr. Muhammad Owais/0000-0003-3204-9776","","","","","93","4","4","3","14","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","2199-4730","","FINANC INNOV","Financ.

In order to trace and analyze suspected Bitcoin transactions and addresses, address clustering methods and Bitcoin flow analysis methods are gaining attention recently. However, existing methods only focus on Bitcoin addresses and flow, and neglect other important information, such as transaction structure and behavior features. In order to exploit all useful features of transactions, this paper proposes a Bitcoin transaction network analytic method for facilitating Blockchain forensic investigation based on an extended safe Petri Net. The structural features and dynamic semantics of Petri net are used in our proposed model to define the static and dynamic features of Bitcoin transactions. Nineteen features have been identified to define Bitcoin transaction patterns for analyzing and finding suspected addresses. Bitcoin gene has been embedded into the Petri net transitions to trace and analyze Bitcoin flow accurately. Finally, marginal distribution analysis of Bitcoin transaction features and data visualization techniques are used to eliminate some false positive samples further and to improve the accuracy of identifying suspected addresses. The proposed Bitcoin transaction network analytic method provides a reliable forensic investigation model along with a prototype platform which is beneficial for financial security. The efficiency of our proposed method is empirically verified based on a real-life case study analysis.","[Wu, Yan; Tao, Fang] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Commun Engn, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yan; Tao, Fang] Jiangsu Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Secur Technol Ind Cyberspace, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Lu; Shahzad, Mohammad Nasir] Univ Leicester, Sch Informat, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Gu, Jiayan; Panneerselvam, John] Univ Derby, Sch Elect Comp & Math, Derby DE22 1GB, England; [Zhu, Rongbo] South Cent Univ Nat, Coll Comp Sci, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China","Jiangsu University; Jiangsu University; University of Leicester; University of Derby; South Central Minzu University","Liu, L (corresponding author), Univ Leicester, Sch Informat, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.","wuyan04418@ujs.edu.cn; taofang7906@hotmail.com; l.liu@leicester.ac.uk; j.gu2@unimail.derby.ac.uk; j.panneerselvam@derby.ac.uk; rbzhu@mail.scuec.edu.cn; mns14@leicester.ac.uk","lu, lu/HGA-0894-2022","Zhu, Rongbo/0000-0003-1620-0560; Liu, Lu/0000-0003-1013-4507","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20170069]; National Natural Science Funds of China [U1836116, 61772562]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB1400703]; Postdoc Funds of China; Jiangsu Province [2015M580396, 1501023A]; UK-Jiangsu 20-20 World Class University Initiative Programme; UK-Jiangsu 20-20 Initiative Pump Priming Grant; Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young Scholars [2017CFA043]","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); National Natural Science Funds of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Postdoc Funds of China; Jiangsu Province; UK-Jiangsu 20-20 World Class University Initiative Programme; UK-Jiangsu 20-20 Initiative Pump Priming Grant; Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young Scholars","This work was supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province under Grant BK20170069, in part by the National Natural Science Funds of China under Grants U1836116 and 61772562, in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFB1400703, in part by the Postdoc Funds of China and Jiangsu Province under Grants 2015M580396 and 1501023A, in part by UK-Jiangsu 20-20 World Class University Initiative Programme, and UK-Jiangsu 20-20 Initiative Pump Priming Grant, and in part by the Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young Scholars under Grant 2017CFA043.","","33","5","5","8","11","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA","2327-4697","","","IEEE T NETW SCI ENG","IEEE Trans.

For this reason, Bitcoin Green (BITG) has been created and would solve these issues. The purpose of this paper is to visualize the users' perception toward BITG through Twitter text analysis. Design/methodology/approach The big data used in this study includes two sources. The first data were extracted from the Google Trends engine during the period between 20 September 2015 and 15 September 2020. The second data were extracted from the Twitter application. This research explores the perceived ease of use, the perceived usefulness, the social influence, the perceived control and the user attitudes toward BITG. Therefore, lexicon-based sentiment analysis techniques combined with different dictionaries are built to visualize the drivers of investor attitudes toward the BITG using Twitter text messages. Besides, this study has checked the validity of two main assumptions using the normality (Jarque-Bera) and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests capable to conclude whether users mostly perceive BITG as a sustainable technology. Findings This empirical work affords insights into users' intentions by exploring the drivers of BITG perception. The results show that users positively perceive the use of BITG as a sustainable blockchain. Besides, its usefulness is more appreciated from its ethical and technological characteristics, and its perceived application is mainly based on investment and coin offering use. Similarly, users are mostly showing positive emotions toward BITG. Research limitations/implications Tweets related to BITG are not as voluminous as the other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which make it difficult to extract all the characteristics and use cases. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work is the first one that uses the theory of planned behavior and the theory of acceptance model to explore cognitive factors in understanding investor intentions in adopting BITG.","[Mnif, Emna] Univ Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia; [Lacombe, Isabelle] Metis Lab, Normandie Campus Havre, Le Havre, France; [Jarboui, Anis] Univ Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia","Universite de Sfax; Universite de Sfax","Jarboui, A (corresponding author), Univ Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia.","emnamnifmasmoudi@gmail.com; isabelle.lacombe@laposte.net; anisjarboui@yahoo.fr","","Lacombe, Isabelle/0000-0003-3959-9260","","","","","83","2","2","4","9","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1746-5680","1746-5699","","SOC BUS REV","Soc.

Furthermore, the watchtower in FPPW learns no information about the off-chain transactions and hence FPPW provides privacy against the watchtower. As a byproduct, we also define the coverage of a watchtower scheme, that is the total capacity of channels that a watchtower can cover on a scale of 0 to 1, and show that FPPW's coverage is higher than those of PISA and Cerberus.

This study identifies the determinants of electronic waste generation in the Bitcoin network using machine learning algorithms. We model the evolutionary patterns of electronic waste and carry out a predictive analytics exercise to achieve this objective. The Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) and Generalized Mean Information Coefficient (GMIC) help to study the association structure. A series of six state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms - Gradient Boosting (GB), Regularized Random Forest (RRF), Bagging-Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines (BM), Hybrid Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems (HYFIS), Self-Organizing Map (SOM), and Quantile Regression Neural Network (QRNN) are used separately for predictive modeling. We compare the predictive performance of all the algorithms. Statistically, the GB is a superior model followed by RRF. The performance of SOM is the least accurate. Our findings reveal that the blockchain's size, energy consumption, and the historical number of Bitcoin are the most determinants of electronic waste generation in the Bitcoin network. The overall findings bring out exciting insights into practical relevance for effectively curbing electronic waste accumulation.","[Jana, Rabin K.] Indian Inst Management Raipur, Operat & Quantitat Methods Area, Atal Nagar, Chhattisgarh, India; [Ghosh, Indranil] Inst Management Technol Hyderabad, It & Analyt Area, Hyderabad 501218, Telangana, India; [Das, Debojyoti] Indian Inst Management Bangalore, Finance & Accounting Area, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India; [Dutta, Anupam] Univ Vaasa, Sch Accounting & Finance, Vaasa, Finland","Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Raipur; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Bangalore; University of Vaasa","Dutta, A (corresponding author), Univ Vaasa, Sch Accounting & Finance, Vaasa, Finland.","adutta@uwasa.fi","Jana, R.

Bitcoins are associated with alpha-numeric addresses and are transferred via transactions. Each transaction is composed of a set of input addresses (associated with unspent outputs received from previous transactions) and a set of output addresses (to which Bitcoins are transferred). Despite Bitcoin was designed with anonymity in mind, different heuristic approaches exist to detect which addresses in a specific transaction belong to the same entity. By applying these heuristics, we build an Address Correspondence Network: in this representation, addresses are nodes are connected with edges if at least one heuristic detects them as belonging to the same entity. In this paper, we analyze for the first time the Address Correspondence Network and show it is characterized by a complex topology, signaled by a broad, skewed degree distribution and a power-law component size distribution. Using a large-scale dataset of addresses for which the controlling entities are known, we show that a combination of external data coupled with standard community detection algorithms can reliably identify entities. The complex nature of the Address Correspondence Network reveals that usage patterns of individual entities create statistical regularities; and that these regularities can be leveraged to more accurately identify entities and gain a deeper understanding of the Bitcoin economy as a whole.","[Fischer, Jan Alexander; Palechor, Andres] Univ Zurich, Fac Business Econ & Informat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Dell'Aglio, Daniele] Aalborg Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Aalborg, Denmark; [Dell'Aglio, Daniele; Bernstein, Abraham] Univ Zurich, Dept Informat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Tessone, Claudio J.] Univ Zurich, UZH Blockchain Ctr, Zurich, Switzerland; [Tessone, Claudio J.] Univ Zurich, URPP Social Networks, Zurich, Switzerland","University of Zurich; Aalborg University; University of Zurich; University of Zurich; University of Zurich","Dell'Aglio, D (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Aalborg, Denmark.;Dell'Aglio, D (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Informat, Zurich, Switzerland.","dade@cs.aau.dk","Dell'Aglio, Daniele/AAH-4635-2019","Dell'Aglio, Daniele/0000-0003-4904-2511; Tessone, Claudio J./0000-0001-7733-6221","Swiss National Science foundation [407550_167177]; University of Zurich through the University Research Priority Program on Social Networks","Swiss National Science foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); University of Zurich through the University Research Priority Program on Social Networks","DD acknowledges partial funding from by the Swiss National Science foundation under contract #407550_167177.

However, it is proved that the pools are vulnerable for security attacks. A strategic pool manager has strong incentive to launch pool block withholding attack by sending some of her miners to infiltrate the other pools. The infiltrating miners try to find (partial) proof-of-work solutions but discard the solution that can actually create blocks. As it is hard to recognize malicious miners,these miners still get reward in the infiltrated pools. In this work, we revisit the game-theoretic model for pool block withholding attacks and propose a revised approach to reallocate the reward to the miners. Instead of proportionally allocating the reward to all miners, a pool manager deducts a fraction from the reward to award the miner who actually mined the block. Accordingly, we prove that, under our scheme, for any number of mining pools, no-pool-attacks is always a Nash equilibrium. Moreover, with only two minority mining pools, no-pool-attacks is the unique Nash equilibrium","[Chen, Zhihuai; Sun, Xiaoming; Zhang, Jialin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zhihuai; Sun, Xiaoming; Zhang, Jialin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Li, Bo] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Shan, Xiaohan] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computing Technology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Tsinghua University","Shan, XH (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.","chenzhihuai@ict.ac.cn; comp-bo.li@polyu.edu.hk; shanxiaohan@tsinghua.edu.cn; sunxiaoming@ict.ac.cn; zhangjialin@ict.ac.cn","","Sun, Xiaoming/0000-0002-0281-1670","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61832003, 61872334]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA27000000]; Hong Kong Polytechnic University [P0034420]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61832003, 61872334), the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA27000000), the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (Grant No. P0034420).","","22","0","0","1","1","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1382-6905","1573-2886","","J COMB OPTIM","J.

Each node maintains a distributed ledger (i.e., blockchain) consisting of retrieved blocks. Therefore, speedy block distribution over the Bitcoin network is essential for all nodes to reach a global consensus on the blockchain. On the other hand, Bitcoin clients are developed as open source software, and thus they can be modified by malicious users. Existing work has pointed out that an attacker can delay the block propagation between neighboring nodes by exploiting the regular timeout mechanism for unexpected slow block transfer caused by temporal network trouble. In this paper, we focus on block diffusion delay attacks, where multiple attackers collude with a specific miner (i.e., a special node that creates new blocks and broadcasts these blocks to the other miners) to disturb the propagation of blocks generated by competing miners. Through simulation experiments, we first reveal that about 30% of honest nodes cannot normally retrieve a block when there are only 1% of the nodes in the system are high-degree adversary nodes in the system. This indicates that the malicious miner colluding with the attackers can intentionally delay the diffusion of the block mined by the competing miner, so as to win the competitive block diffusion even if it loses at the competitive block mining. To alleviate the block diffusion delay attack, we propose two kinds of countermeasures: a proactive approach that is a speedy recovery method from the interruption by adjusting the timeout value and a reactive approach that is a block retrieval node selection method based on the past download rate from each neighbor. Through simulation experiments, we show the countermeasures can effectively alleviate the risk.","[Sasabe, Masahiro; Yamamoto, Masanari; Zhang, Yuanyu; Kasahara, Shoji] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, 8916-5 Takayama Cho, Ikoma, Nara 6300192, Japan","Nara Institute of Science & Technology","Sasabe, M (corresponding author), Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, 8916-5 Takayama Cho, Ikoma, Nara 6300192, Japan.","m-sasabe@ieee.org","","Kasahara, Shoji/0000-0001-9785-8350; Zhang, Yuanyu/0000-0002-3248-5909","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","","36","0","0","1","5","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1055-7148","1099-1190","","INT J NETW MANAG","Int.

Sometimes, the price has exhibited big jumps. Bitcoin prices have also had extreme, unexpected crashes. We test the predictive power of a wide range of determinants on bitcoins' price direction under the continuous transfer entropy approach as a feature selection criterion. Accordingly, the statistically significant assets in the sense of permutation test on the nearest neighbour estimation of local transfer entropy are used as features or explanatory variables in a deep learning classification model to predict the price direction of bitcoin. The proposed variable selection do not find significative the explanatory power of NASDAQ and Tesla. Under different scenarios and metrics, the best results are obtained using the significant drivers during the pandemic as validation. In the test, the accuracy increased in the post-pandemic scenario of July 2020 to January 2021 without drivers. In other words, our results indicate that in times of high volatility, Bitcoin seems to self-regulate and does not need additional drivers to improve the accuracy of the price direction.","[Garcia-Medina, Andres] PIIT, Ctr Invest Matemat, Unidad Monterrey, AC Av Alianza Ctr 502, Apodaca 66628, Mexico; [Garcia-Medina, Andres] Consejo Nacl Ciencia & Technol, Av Insurgentes 1582,Col Credito Constructor, Mexico City 03940, DF, Mexico; [Luu Duc Huynh, Toan] WHU, Otto Beisheim Sch Management, D-56179 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Luu Duc Huynh, Toan] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, UEH Inst Innovat UII, Ho Chi Minh City 70000, Vietnam; [Luu Duc Huynh, Toan] IPAG Business Sch, F-75006 Paris, France","WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management; Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; IPAG Business School","Garcia-Medina, A (corresponding author), PIIT, Ctr Invest Matemat, Unidad Monterrey, AC Av Alianza Ctr 502, Apodaca 66628, Mexico.;Garcia-Medina, A (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Ciencia & Technol, Av Insurgentes 1582,Col Credito Constructor, Mexico City 03940, DF, Mexico.","andres.garcia@cimat.mx; toanhld@ueh.edu.vn","García-Medina, Andrés/ABE-6331-2021","García-Medina, Andrés/0000-0002-2198-880X; Huynh, Toan Luu Duc/0000-0002-1486-127X","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT, Mexico) through fund FOSEC SEP-INVESTIGACION BASICA [A1-S-43514]","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT, Mexico) through fund FOSEC SEP-INVESTIGACION BASICA(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT))","This research was funded Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT, Mexico) through fund FOSEC SEP-INVESTIGACION BASICA (Grant No. A1-S-43514).","","50","4","4","0","2","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1099-4300","","ENTROPY-SWITZ","Entropy","DEC","2021","23","12","","","","","","","1582","10.3390/e23121582","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e23121582","","","19","Physics, Multidisciplinary","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Physics","XY3LP","34945888","gold, Green Published, Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000736878600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Some studies have used traditional statistical and econometric methods to understand the economic and technology determinants of Bitcoin, few have considered the development of predictive models using these determinants. In this study, we developed a two-stage approach for exploring whether the information hidden in economic and technology determinants can accurately predict the Bitcoin exchange rate. In the first stage, two nonlinear feature selection methods comprising an artificial neural network and random forest are used to reduce the subset of potential predictors by measuring the importance of economic and technology factors. In the second stage, the potential predictors are integrated into long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the Bitcoin exchange rate regardless of the previous exchange rate. Our results showed that by using the economic and technology determinants, LSTM could achieve better predictive performance than the autoregressive integrated moving average, support vector regression, adaptive network fuzzy inference system, and LSTM methods, which all use the previous exchange rate. Thus, information obtained from economic and technology determinants is more important for predicting the Bitcoin exchange rate than the previous exchange rate.

The price of Bitcoin is extremely volatile, which can be described as high-benefit and high-risk. To minimize the risk involved, a means of more accurately predicting the Bitcoin price is required. Most of the existing studies of Bitcoin prediction are based on historical (i.e., benchmark) data, without considering the real-time (i.e., live) data. To mitigate the issue of price volatility and achieve more precise outcomes, this study suggests using historical and real-time data to predict the Bitcoin candlestick-or open, high, low, and close (OHLC)- prices. Seeking a better prediction model, the present study proposes time series-based deep learning models. In particular, two deep learning algorithms were applied, namely, long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Using real-time data, the Bitcoin candlesticks were predicted for three intervals: the next 4 h, the next 12 h, and the next 24 h. The results showed that the best-performing model was the LSTM-based model with the 4-h interval. In particular, this model achieved a stellar performance with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.63, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0009, a mean square error (MSE) of 9e-07, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0005, and an R-squared coefficient (R2) of 0.994. With these results, the proposed prediction model has demonstrated its efficiency over the models proposed in previous studies. The findings of this study have considerable implications in the business field, as the proposed model can assist investors and traders in precisely identifying Bitcoin sales and buying opportunities.","[Alkhodhairi, Reem K.; Aljalhami, Shahad R.; Rusayni, Norah K.; Alshobaili, Jowharah F.; Al-Shargabi, Amal A.] Qassim Univ, Coll Comp, Dept Informat Technol, Buraydah 51452, Saudi Arabia; [Alabdulatif, Abdulatif] Qassim Univ, Coll Comp, Dept Comp Sci, Buraydah 51452, Saudi Arabia","Qassim University; Qassim University","Al-Shargabi, AA (corresponding author), Qassim Univ, Coll Comp, Dept Informat Technol, Buraydah 51452, Saudi Arabia.","a.alshargabi@qu.edu.sa","Alabdulatif, Abdulatif/V-1395-2019","Alabdulatif, Abdulatif/0000-0002-3167-8020","Deanship of Scientific Research, Qassim University","Deanship of Scientific Research, Qassim University","Researchers would like to thank the Deanship of Scientific Research, Qassim University for funding publication of this project.","","20","0","0","0","5","TECH SCIENCE PRESS","HENDERSON","871 CORONADO CENTER DR, SUTE 200, HENDERSON, NV 89052 USA","1546-2218","1546-2226","","CMC-COMPUT MATER CON","CMC-Comput.

Due to the critical nature of these applications, it is pivotal to model and evaluate dependability of the block chain-based systems, contributing to their reliable and robust operation. This paper models and analyzes the dependability of Bitcoin nodes subject to Eclipse attacks and state-dependent mitigation activities. Built upon the block chain technology, the Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency system enabling an individual user to trade freely without the involvement of banks or any other types of intermediate agents. However, a node in the Bitcoin is vulnerable to the Eclipse attack, which aims to monopolize the information flow of the victim node. A semi-Markov process (SMP) based approach is proposed to model the Eclipse attack behavior and possible mitigation activities that may prevent the attack from being successful during the attack process. The SMP model is then evaluated to determine the steady-state dependability of the Bitcoin node. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the influence of the time to restart the Bitcoin software and time to detect and delete the malicious message on the Bitcoin node dependability.","[Zhou, Chencheng; Xing, Liudong; Liu, Qisi; Wang, Honggang] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA","University of Massachusetts System; University Massachusetts Dartmouth","Xing, LD (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA.","czhou@umassd.edu; lxing@umassd.edu; qliu1@umassd.edu; hwangl@umassd.edu","","","","","","","46","4","2","0","12","INT JOURNAL MATHEMATICAL ENGINEERING & MANAGEMENT SCIENCES-IJMEMS","DEHRADUN","INT JOURNAL MATHEMATICAL ENGINEERING & MANAGEMENT SCIENCES-IJMEMS, JAMNIPUR, HERBERTPUR, DEHRADUN, INDIA","2455-7749","","","INT J MATH ENG MANAG","Int.

The sample period runs from 07/01/2013 to 06/30/2018 and the daily closing values of the selected assets/indices were used. Findings - This study finds evidence that the inclusion of Bitcoin among the investment alternatives would cause a statistically significant positive displacement and an expansion of the efficient frontier of the Brazilian retail market. This would result in a significant increase in the return on the tangency portfolio. In addition to improving the indicators of optimization of the risk-return binomial, the cryptoasset would be included in many optimal portfolios in the 2013Q3-2018Q2 period.

Through our analysis, we identified five narratives, including The Dark Side, The Bright Side, The Tulip Mania, The Idea, and The Normality. Our analysis demonstrates the interpretive flexibility of technology as influenced by ideologies, and we construct a theoretical model demonstrating media's role as constructor and conduit.

As such, this paper attempts to investigate the possibility if Bitcoin can be hedged by selected fiat currencies (EUR, JPY and GBP) as Bitcoin prices have experienced high and persistent volatility. To do so, we compute optimal hedge ratios between Bitcoin and fiat currencies over the period 02/02/2012-30/11/2017 based on the VAR-DCC-GARCH model, VAR-ADCC-GARCH model and VAR-component GARCH-DCC model. A rolling window analysis is employed to establish out-of-sample one-step-ahead forecasts of dynamic conditional correlations between different assets. This leads to establish time-varying hedge ratios and thus dynamic cross-hedging Bitcoin/fiat currency markets. The empirical results clearly show the time-varying correlations between Bitcoin and fiat currencies under different specifications, implying a dynamic behavior of the relationship between such assets. For all the proposed models, such dynamic correlations are rather characterized by trending downward over the period under study. The results also display time-varying hedge ratios which lead to an ongoing regular demand for rebalancing the hedged positions under different specifications. As a matter of fact, using various models which take into account different aspects of volatility and correlation structures allows to better implement dynamic hedging strategies.","[Majdoub, Jihed; Ben Sassi, Salim; Bejaoui, Azza] Univ Tunis, High Inst Management, Le Bardo 2000, Tunisia; [Majdoub, Jihed; Ben Sassi, Salim] Univ Tunis Manar, LAREQUAD FSEG Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia","Universite de la Manouba; Universite de Tunis; Universite de Tunis-El-Manar","Bejaoui, A (corresponding author), Univ Tunis, High Inst Management, Le Bardo 2000, Tunisia.","jihed.majdoub@gmail.com; salimbensassi@yahoo.fr; bjaouiazza2@yahoo.fr","","","","","","","52","7","7","1","6","SPRINGER INT PUBL AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","1593-8883","1129-6569","","DECIS ECON FINANC","Decis.

However, their short term profitability using algorithmic trading strategies remains unanswered. In this work, we focus on the short term profitability of BTC against the euro and the yen for an eight-year period using seven trading algorithms over trading periods of length 15 and 30 days. We use the classical buy and hold (BH) as a benchmark strategy. Rather surprisingly, we found that on average, the yen is more profitable than BTC and the euro; however the answer also depends on the choice of algorithm. Reservation price algorithms result in 7.5% and 10% of average returns over 15 and 30 days respectively which is the highest for all the algorithms for the three assets. For BTC, all algorithms outperform the BH strategy. We also analyze the effect of transaction fee on the profitability of algorithms for BTC and observe that for trading period of length 15 no trading strategy is profitable for BTC. For trading period of length 30, only two strategies are profitable.","[Ahmad, Iftikhar; Khalil, Muhammad Imran Khan] Univ Engn & Technol Peshawar, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Muhammad Ovais] Karlstad Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Karlstad, Sweden; [Ahmad, Muhammad Ovais] Univ Oulu, M3S Res Unit, Oulu, Finland; [Alqarni, Mohammed A.] Univ Jeddah, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Dept Software Engn, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Almazroi, Abdulwahab Ali] Univ Jeddah, Coll Comp & Informat Technol Khulais, Dept Informat Technol, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","University of Peshawar; Karlstad University; University of Oulu; University of Jeddah; University of Jeddah","Ahmad, I (corresponding author), Univ Engn & Technol Peshawar, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Peshawar, Pakistan.","ia@uetpeshawar.edu.pk","Chanelian, Serena/ABE-4873-2021; Almazroi, Abdulwahab Ali/R-9240-2019; Ahmad, Iftikhar/ABE-5182-2021","Chanelian, Serena/0000-0001-5727-6137; Almazroi, Abdulwahab Ali/0000-0001-7181-2100; Ahmad, Iftikhar/0000-0001-7863-3746; Alqarni, Mohammed A./0000-0002-3284-537X","","","","","30","1","1","2","10","PEERJ INC","LONDON","341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND","","2376-5992","","PEERJ COMPUT SCI","PeerJ Comput.

Now, we revisit this question, using a recent version of the Bitcoin network that has grown almost 100-fold since our original analysis. Furthermore, we additionally carry out a comparison with Ethereum, the second most important cryptocurrency. Our results show that preferential attachment continues to be a key factor in the evolution of both the Bitcoin and Ethereum transactoin networks.

I test this hypothesis by exploiting cross-country shadow market variation and exogenous shocks to darknet marketplaces used exclusively for illegal transactions in 28 emerging market economies. I find that Bitcoin trade volume generated by underground activity reacts much more strongly to inflation expectations than Bitcoin trade volume among the general population, providing direct evidence that shadow market participants substitute away from cash and towards cryptocurrency to conduct anonymous transactions.

Evidence from the US and China","INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS & FINANCE","","","English","Article","","","","","","Bitcoin; Gold; Financial stress index; Spillover index; Dynamic frequency analysis","","The measurement of the dynamic relationship between financial stress and the financial asset market is in its infancy. To quantify the intrinsic relationship among Bitcoin, gold and the financial stress index (FSI), this paper employs a volatility connectedness framework in the time-frequency domain. This study finds that the volatility spillover is relatively strong over a short-term horizon and sharply increased during uncertain periods. Specifically, we focus on two unexpected shocks, i.e., the immigration crisis and the China-U.S. trade conflict, that greatly affect the short-term and medium-term relationship, respectively, between the FSI and financial asset markets. During periods of uncertainty, the U.S. FSI has a medium-term impact on gold prices, whereas Bitcoin is less influenced by this stress; under normal conditions, the U.S. FSI is a short-term transmitter for Bitcoin whereas the China FSI is a medium-term transmitter for gold. Additionally, Bitcoin is greatly affected by financial stress in the U.S. exchange market and China stock market, and gold is mainly influenced by financial stress in the exchange market from the U.S. These results are important for investors and policymakers making decisions during periods of uncertainty.","[Zhang, Hongwei] Cent South Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hongwei] Cent South Univ, Inst Met Resources Strategy, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Peijin] Duke Univ, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Central South University; Central South University; Duke University","Wang, PJ (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Durham, NC 27710 USA.","hongwei@csu.edu.cn; pj.wang@duke.edu","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71874210, 71633006, 71874207, 71974208]; National Social Science Foundation of China [18ZDA061, 19BJY076]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2020JJ5784]; Innovation-Driven Project of Central South University [2020CX049]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); Innovation-Driven Project of Central South University","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 71874210, 71633006, 71874207, 71974208]; the National Social Science Foundation of China [grant number 18ZDA061, 19BJY076]; the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [grant number 2020JJ5784] and the Innovation-Driven Project of Central South University [grant number 2020CX049].","","28","14","14","1","21","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1059-0560","1873-8036","","INT REV ECON FINANC","Int.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the safe-haven properties of Bitcoin compared to the stock market. Design/methodology/approach Based on intraday data, this study compares the price efficiencies of Bitcoin and Morgan Stanley Capital Index (MSCI) using Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis for the second half of 2020. This study then evaluates Bitcoin's safe-haven property using Detrended Partial-Cross-Correlation Analysis (DPCCA). Findings This study finds that the price efficiency of Bitcoin is lower than that of MSCI. Further, Bitcoin was not a safe haven at any time for the MSCI index. The net cross-correlations between Bitcoin and MSCI are weak and they vary at different time scales. Research limitations/implications The behavior of market prices varies over time. Therefore, it is important to replicate this study for other time periods. Social implications The paper sheds light on the price behavior of Bitcoin during a period of instability. The results suggest that the construction of portfolios should differ based on the time horizons of the investors. Originality/value The authors compare Bitcoin against a global equity index instead of a specific country index or commodity.

For this purpose, a wide variety of GARCH-type models have been employed. However, there is no consensus in the literature on which specification arising from the volatility equation and the assumed error distribution is better in an out-of-sample performance. This study tries to fill this gap by comparing the forecasting performances of 110 GARCH-type models for Bitcoin volatility. Furthermore, it proposes a new combining method based on support vector machines (SVM). This method effectively selects the set of superior models to perform meta-learning. The results indicate that the best performing GARCH specification depends on the loss function chosen, and the proposed method leads to more accurate volatility forecasts than those of the best GARCH-type models and other combining methods investigated.

Our results, however, do not support prior studies' findings of a direct relationship between the industry indices and Bitcoin returns.","[Kalyvas, Antonios; Papakyriakou, Panayiotis] Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Deptt Banking & Finance, Southampton, Hants, England; [Li, Zeming] Univ Coll Dublin, Michael Smurfit Business Sch, Dublin, Ireland; [Sakkas, Athanasios] Univ Nottingham, Business Sch, Div Finance Risk & Banking, Nottingham, England","Solent University; University of Southampton; University College Dublin; University of Nottingham","Papakyriakou, P (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Deptt Banking & Finance, Southampton, Hants, England.","p.papakyriakou@soton.ac.uk","Sakkas, Athanasios/ABA-9380-2021","Sakkas, Athanasios/0000-0001-5348-3382; PAPAKYRIAKOU, PANAYIOTIS/0000-0001-7429-8063; Li, Zeming/0000-0002-1638-8180","","","","","47","0","0","1","4","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1351-847X","1466-4364","","EUR J FINANC","Eur.

Design/methodology/approach The authors used the bivariate Dynamic Conditional Correlation, Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity model, on the five-day returns of Bitcoin and Australian stock indices for the sample period between 23 April, 2011 and 19 April, 2021. Findings The results show that Bitcoin offered weak safe haven and hedging benefits when combined in a portfolio with S&P/ASX 200 Financials index, S&P/ASX 200 Banks index or S&P/ASX 300 Banks index. In regard to the S&P/ASX All Ordinaries Gold index, the authors found Bitcoin a risky candidate with inconsistent safe haven and hedging benefits. Against S&P/ASX 50 index, S&P/ASX 200 index and S&P/ASX 300 index, Bitcoin was nothing more than a diversifier. The outset of the second COVID-19 wave, which was comparatively more severe than the first, is also reflected in the results with considerably higher correlations.

Design/methodology/approach - The dynamic contemporaneous nexus has been analyzed using both the multivariate DECO-GARCH model proposed by Engle and Kelly (2012) and quantile on quantile (QQ) methodology proposed by Sim and Zhou (2015). Our study is implemented using the daily data spanning from 6 September 2012 to 12 August 2019. Findings - First, the findings show that the average return equicorrelation across Bitcoin prices and CEE stock indices are positive, even though it is found to be time-varying over the research period shown. Second, the Bitcoin-CEE stock market association has positive signs for most pairs of quantiles of both variables and represents a rather similar pattern for the cases of Poland, the Czech Republic and Croatia. However, a weaker and primarily negative connectedness is found for Hungary and Romania, respectively. Furthermore, the interconnectedness between the co-movements in the Bitcoin market and stock returns changes significantly across quantiles of both variables within each nation, indicating that the Bitcoin-stock market relationship is dependent on both the cycle of the stock market and the nature of Bitcoin price shocks. Practical implications - The evidence documented in this study has significant implications for divergent economic agents, including global investors, risk managers and policymakers, who would benefit from a comprehensive knowledge of the Bitcoin-stock market relationship to build efficient risk-hedging models and to conduct appropriate policy reactions to information spillover effects in different time horizons. Originality/value - This paper is the first study employing both the multivariate DECO-GARCH model and QQmethodology to shed light on the nexus between Bitcoin prices and the stock markets in CEE countries. The DECO model uses more information to compute dynamic correlations between each pair of returns than standard dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) models, declining the estimation noise of the correlations. Besides, QQ approach allows us to capture some nuanced features of the Bitcoin-stock market relationship and explore the interdependence in its entirely. Therefore, the main contribution of this article to the related literature in this field is significant.","[Ngo Thai Hung] Univ Finance Mkt, Fac Econ & Law, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","","Hung, NT (corresponding author), Univ Finance Mkt, Fac Econ & Law, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.","hung.nt@ufm.edu.vn","Hung, Ngo Thai/AAC-9394-2020","Hung, Ngo Thai/0000-0002-6976-1583","","","","","37","2","2","1","2","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","2444-8451","2444-8494","","EUR J MANAG BUS ECON","Eur.

We construct different algorithm calculations for returns, volume and volatility to test how this proxy impacts. We find that the global Economic Policy Uncertainty negatively causes Bitcoin volumes and volatilities. Therefore, under uncertain regimes, investors are risk-averse to trade, which makes the market less volatile. Our findings confirm the existence of pessimistic risk premium, the theory of deteriorating liquidity and the widen bid-ask spread, which lead to a decline in trading volume under uncertainties in the Bitcoin market. By using different reliable data sources as well as expanding timeframe until May 2020 with COVID-19 pandemic, our results remain robust.

Results of the static analysis show that the level and slope of the yield curve are net transmitters of shocks to both the exchange rate and its volatility. The exchange rate of the Euro and the volatility of the Euro and the Canadian dollar exchange rate are net transmitters of shocks. Meanwhile, the curvature of the yield curve and the Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc, and British Pound act mainly as net receivers. Our static connectedness analysis shows that Bitcoin is mainly independent of shocks from the yield curve's level, slope, and curvature, and from any main currency investigated. These findings hint that Bitcoin might provide hedging benefits. However, similar to the static analysis, our dynamic analysis shows that during different periods and particularly in stressful times, Bitcoin is far from being isolated from other currencies or the yield curve components. The dynamic analysis allows us to observe Bitcoin's connectedness in times of stress. Evidence supporting this contention is the substantially increased connectedness due to policy shocks, political uncertainty, and systemic crisis, implying no empirical support for Bitcoin's safe-haven property during stress times. The increased connectedness in the dynamic analysis compared with the static approach implies that in normal times and especially in stressful times, Bitcoin has the property of a diversifier. The results may have important implications for investors and policymakers regarding their risk monitoring and their assets allocation and investment strategies.","[Aharon, David Y.] Ono Acad Coll, Dept Business Adm, Zahal 104 St, IL-5545173 Kiryat Ono, Israel; [Umar, Zaghum] Zayed Univ, Coll Business, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Umar, Zaghum; Vo, Xuan Vinh] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Inst Business Res, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","Zayed University; Ho Chi Minh City University Economics","Umar, Z (corresponding author), Zayed Univ, Coll Business, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.","zaghum.umar@gmail.com","","Umar, Zaghum/0000-0002-0425-2665","University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","The authors are thankful to the editor and anonymous referees for their insightful comments.

First, using the time varying parameter vector autoregressions spillover test, we found that there is strong connectedness between the Bitcoin and precious metals markets. Second, BDS test shows that nonlinearity is a very crucial factor to be put into consideration when examining the causal effect of economic policy uncertainty on the interactions between Bitcoin and precious metals markets. Third, the non-parametric causality-in-quantile test confirms that the connectedness between the markets and economic policy uncertainty is stronger mostly around the median and higher quantiles. Thus, the connection between bitcoin and precious metals might not act as a hedge or safe haven against economic policy uncertainties especially around these periods.

A Bitcoin network is comprised of two interactive parties: individual miners and mining pool managers, each of which strives to maximize its own utility. In particular, individual miners choose which mining pool to join and decide on how much mining power to commit under limited constraints on the mining budget and mining power capacity; managers of mining pools determine how to allocate the mining reward and how to adjust the membership fee. In this work we investigate the miners' and mining pool managers' decisions in repeated Bitcoin mining competitions by building a Monte-Carlo discrete-event simulation model. Our simulation model (i) captures the behavior of these two parties and how their decisions affect each other, and (ii) characterizes the system-level dynamics of the blockchain in terms of the mining difficulty level and total mining power. In addition, we study the sensitivity of system performance metrics with respect to various control parameters. Our analysis may provide useful guidelines to mining activity participants in the Bitcoin network.","[Li, Kejun; Liu, Yunan; Wan, Hong] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Raleigh, NC 27606 USA; [Huang, Yining] North Carolina State Univ, Operat Res Grad Program, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA","University of North Carolina; North Carolina State University; University of North Carolina; North Carolina State University","Li, KJ (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Raleigh, NC 27606 USA.","kli15@ncsu.edu","","","","","","","66","2","2","1","16","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0305-0548","1873-765X","","COMPUT OPER RES","Comput.

The goal here is to determine the nature of the bubbles and crashes (i.e., whether they are endogenous due to their own price evolution or exogenous due to external market and/or policy influences). A systematic market event analysis is performed and correlated to the Bitcoin bubbles detected. Based on the daily LPPLS confidence indictor from 1 December 2019 to 24 June 2021, this analysis has disclosed that the Bitcoin boom from November 2020 to mid-January 2021 is an endogenous bubble, stemming from the self-reinforcement of cooperative herding and imitative behaviors of market players, while the price spike from mid-January 2021 to mid-April 2021 is likely an exogenous bubble driven by extrinsic events including a series of large-scale acquisitions and adoptions by well-known institutions such as Visa and Tesla. Finally, the utilities of multi-resolution LPPLS analysis in revealing both short-term changes and long-term states have also been demonstrated in this study.","[Shu, Min] Univ Wisconsin Stout, Math Stat & Comp Sci Dept, Menomonie, WI 54751 USA; [Song, Ruiqiang] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Geospatial Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Zhu, Wei] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stout; Michigan Technological University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Community College; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook","Shu, M (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Stout, Math Stat & Comp Sci Dept, Menomonie, WI 54751 USA.","shum@uwstout.edu; rsong1@mtu.edu; wei.zhu@stonybrook.edu","Shu, Min/GOK-2682-2022","Shu, Min/0000-0003-2108-3661","Faculty Research Initiative Grant at the University","Faculty Research Initiative Grant at the University","The New Faculty Start-Up Funds at the University ofWisconsin-Stout was approved on 6 November 2020.

This is especially true for Bitcoin, still, nowadays, the most popular cryptocurrency. This paper presents an analysis to detect the influence of a set of topological properties of the Bitcoin Users Graph on Bitcoin's exchange rate.1 We consider, besides classical properties, a novel notion of Trustful Transaction Graph introduced to describe partial Users Graphs derived by chains of 0-confirmation transactions. We present a temporal analysis of the evolution of a set of features with a single day granularity. Afterwards, we applied autoregressive distributed-lag linear regression to assess whether and with which strength and duration a change in the considered features is likely to influence the exchange rate up to a prespecified number of days (fifteen) in the future. The results show that some of the considered features significantly influence the exchange rate up to several days, and that such relationships are likely not to be spurious, since we found that those features contribute significantly to decrease the error in predicting the exchange rate.","[Crowcroft, Jon; Maesa, Damiano Di Francesco] Univ Cambridge, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Magrini, Alessandro; Marino, Andrea] Univ Florence, Dept Stat, Comp Sci, Applicat, I-50121 Florence, Italy; [Ricci, Laura] Univ Pisa, Dept Comp Sci, I-56126 Pisa, Italy","University of Cambridge; University of Florence; University of Pisa","Maesa, DD (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.","jon.crowcroft@cl.cam.ac.uk; d.difrancesco@for.unipi.it; alessandro.magrini@unifi.it; andrea.marino@unifi.it; laura.ricci@unipi.it","Magrini, Alessandro/AAT-8562-2021; ricci, laura/Q-7651-2016","Magrini, Alessandro/0000-0002-7278-5332; Crowcroft, Jon/0000-0002-7013-0121; ricci, laura/0000-0002-8179-8215","","","","","22","1","1","0","1","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA","2327-4697","","","IEEE T NETW SCI ENG","IEEE Trans.

Stochastic modeling has been explored to quantitatively investigate selfish mining in imperfect blockchain networks. However, prior modeling-based analysis approaches have some of the following issues: (1) only focus on Bitcoin or Ethereum, or (2) ignore extended forks and just consider natural forks, or (3) only compute the mining revenue without assessing the performance and security of the blockchain system when the system suffers from selfish mining. In this paper, we aim to address these issues. We build a Markov chain to make quantitative analysis of selfish mining in imperfect Bitcoin and Ethereum networks with natural and extended forks. Formulas are derived to calculate the mining revenue for the selfish pool (comprising selfish miners) and honest miners, respectively. Moreover, we derive the formulas of performance metrics (namely, transactions per second and stale block ratio) and the formula of security metric (namely, the probability of double-spending success) of the system. These quantitative results can help understand the impact of selfish mining on imperfect blockchain networks and then help the detection of selfish mining.","[Kang, Hongyue; Chang, Xiaolin; Yang, Runkai] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing Key Lab Secur & Privacy Intelligent Trans, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Misic, Jelena; Misic, Vojislav B.] Ryerson Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada","Beijing Jiaotong University; Toronto Metropolitan University","Chang, XL (corresponding author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing Key Lab Secur & Privacy Intelligent Trans, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.","19112051@bjtu.edu.cn; xlchang@bjtu.edu.cn; 18112049@bjtu.edu.cn; jmisic@scs.ryerson.ca; vmisic@ryerson.ca","","Kang, Hongyue/0000-0002-9908-347X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1836105]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2020YJS042]; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","The work of H.

We propose a new development of copula-based joint distribution function of returns to simulate the Value-at-Risk and expected shortfall of portfolios including Bitcoin (or gold) and those without it. The stochastic dominance method is also used to compare the return distributions of the three types of portfolios. Empirical results show that gold is a better portfolio diversifier than Bitcoin as it helps better reduce the risk of portfolios. On the other hand, Bitcoin better increases the return but also increases the risk. The stochastic dominance results further show that portfolios diversified by gold dominate those diversified by Bitcoin. Based on these findings, we conclude that in China, gold is a better portfolio diversifier than Bitcoin for risk-averse investors. However, for risk-seeking investors, Bitcoin can be a better choice. This result is found to be robust to the time, frequency and currency effects.","[Pho, Kim Hung] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Math & Stat, Fract Calculus Optimizat & Algebra Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Ly, Sel] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Math & Stat, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Lu, Richard] Feng Chia Univ, Taichung, Taiwan; [Van Hoang, Thi Hong] Montpellier Business Sch, Social & Sustainable Finance, Montpellier, France; [Wong, Wing-Keung] Asia Univ, Dept Finance, Fintech Ctr, Taichung, Taiwan; [Wong, Wing-Keung] Asia Univ, Big Data Res Ctr, Taichung, Taiwan; [Wong, Wing-Keung] China Med Univ Hosp, Dept Med Res, Taichung, Taiwan; [Wong, Wing-Keung] Hang Seng Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Ton Duc Thang University; Ton Duc Thang University; Feng Chia University; Montpellier Business School; Asia University Taiwan; Asia University Taiwan; China Medical University Taiwan; China Medical University Hospital - Taiwan; Hang Seng University of Hong Kong","Hoang, THV (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier Res Management, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34185 Montpellier, France.","phokimhung@tdtu.edu.vn; lysel@tdtu.edu.v; rclu@mail.fcu.edu.tw; thv.hoang@montpellier-bs.com; wong@asia.edu.tw","Wong, Wing-Keung/AAI-9296-2020; Pho, Kim Hung/AAO-4536-2020","Wong, Wing-Keung/0000-0001-6755-572X; Pho, Kim Hung/0000-0003-0410-8839; Ly, Sel/0000-0002-2987-2991; Pho, Kim Hung/0000-0001-9743-1306","","","","","87","12","12","1","23","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1057-5219","1873-8079","","INT REV FINANC ANAL","Int.

However, its volatility and brand new trading mode has made it challenging to devising an acceptable automatically-generating strategy. This study proposes a framework for automatic high-frequency bitcoin transactions based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm - proximal policy optimization (PPO). The framework creatively regards the transaction process as actions, returns as awards and prices as states to align with the idea of reinforcement learning. It compares advanced machine learning-based models for static price predictions including support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional network (TCN), and Transformer by applying them to the real-time bitcoin price and the experimental results demonstrate that LSTM outperforms. Then an automatically-generating transaction strategy is constructed building on PPO with LSTM as the basis to construct the policy. Extensive empirical studies validate that the proposed method perform superiorly to various common trading strategy benchmarks for a single financial product. The approach is able to trade bitcoins in a simulated environment with synchronous data and obtains a 31.67% more return than that of the best benchmark, improving the benchmark by 12.75%. The proposed framework can earn excess returns through both the period of volatility and surge, which opens the door to research on building a single cryptocurrency trading strategy based on deep learning. Visualizations of trading the process show how the model handles high-frequency transactions to provide inspiration and demonstrate that it can be expanded to other financial products.

We confirm the existence of both mediation and moderation effects in the cryptocurrency lending market by employing a moderated mediation model. First, the empirical results show that the interest rate is closely related to the loan-to-value ratio, which works as the mediation variable in lending. Second, the interest rate reveals a clear connection with price fluctuations of Bitcoin. This brings up the momentum phenomenon in the lending process and incentives borrowers to acquire more money, leading to pro-cyclical speculation. Third, the lending amount reflects a moderation effect in the lending market, and the net effect of the currency price on the interest rate turns negative when the loan amount exceeds a threshold, resulting in the 'seesaw' effect in cryptocurrency lending. The above findings confirm that cryptocurrency lending reflects a certain degree of option characteristics and complies with the risk-debt model, which provides more evidence for understanding the momentum phenomenon and investor behaviour in the cryptocurrency lending market.","[Zhang Shuai; Ba Shusong] Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch PHBS, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Hou Xinyu] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Business, 135 Xingang West Rd, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Peking University; Sun Yat Sen University","Hou, XY (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Business, 135 Xingang West Rd, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.","996034119@qq.com","","","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2020M670004]","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation)","This work is supported by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2020M670004) .

Since cybercriminals usually demand their ransom using Bitcoin, Bitcoin has also become a part of this speculation. Unfortunately, however, all of the stories are based on anecdotal evidence. Therefore, the current study explores the dynamic properties of ransomware attacks, Bitcoin prices, and terrorist activities by connecting two opportunity-based theory frameworks: The Routine Activity Theory (RAT) and Cyber-Routine Activity Theory (Cyber-RAT). The findings of the study indicated unidirectional ties between the prevalence of ransomware and Bitcoin as well as ties between the prevalence of ransomware and terrorist activities. Several policies and prevention strategies from the overall findings of interrelated relations among three events are also presented.","[Lee, Hannarae] Bridgewater State Univ, Dept Criminal Justice, 10 Shaw Dr Maxwell Lib Room 312 E, Bridgewater, MA 02325 USA; [Choi, Kyung-Shick] Boston Univ, Dept Appl Social Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Massachusetts System of Public Higher Education; Bridgewater State College; Boston University","Lee, H (corresponding author), Bridgewater State Univ, Dept Criminal Justice, 10 Shaw Dr Maxwell Lib Room 312 E, Bridgewater, MA 02325 USA.","h2lee@bridgew.edu","","","","","","","58","1","1","1","7","TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC","PHILADELPHIA","530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA","1556-4886","1556-4991","","VICTIMS OFFENDERS","Victims Offenders","APR 3","2021","16","3","","","SI","","363","384","","10.1080/15564886.2020.1835764","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15564886.2020.1835764","","","22","Criminology & Penology","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Criminology & Penology","QI0LN","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000618667000005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, previous studies have built these hybrid models in a form of a first-order GARCH(1,1) process by following general use for GARCH models. But the way of estimating parameters for GARCH and machine learning models differs considerably. Hence, we have investigated the effect of different model orders of the GARCH process on the volatility forecasts of Bitcoin obtained by the four most used machine learning models. Furthermore, we have proposed a stacking ensemble methodology based on GARCH hybrid models to improve the results further. The proposed stacking ensemble methodology utilizes the techniques of feature selection and feature extraction to reduce the dimension of the predictors before meta-learning. The results show that using higher model orders increases the accuracy of volatility forecasts for hybrid GARCH models. Also, the proposed stacking ensemble with LASSO produces forecasts superior to almost all hybrid models and better than the ordinary stacking ensemble.","[Aras, Serkan] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Econometr Dept, Izmir, Turkey","Dokuz Eylul University","Aras, S (corresponding author), Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Econometr Dept, Izmir, Turkey.","serkan.aras@deu.edu.tr","aras, serkan/Q-2098-2019","aras, serkan/0000-0002-6808-3979","","","","","68","14","14","9","20","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0957-4174","1873-6793","","EXPERT SYST APPL","Expert Syst.

First, we identify the period during which two important Bitcoin bubbles occurred based on the generalized supremum augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) method. There are two significant bubble cycles. The first bubble lasted approximately 26 days from November 25, 2017, to December 21, 2017, while the second bubble lasted approximately one week from June 22 to June 29, 2019. The occurrence of the first bubble was related to the considerable expansion of initial coin offerings (ICOs) in 2017, while the formation of the second bubble was affected by the release of Libra. Second, as the GSADF method cannot be used to accurately infer the time at which a bubble bursts, we employ the log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) model for this purpose. We verify that the LPPLS method can not only infer the timing of a bubble burst but also shows stable results. Finally, we demonstrate the implications of the 2019 bubble. During the 2019 bubble, due to the increased supervision of European and American governments and the impact of hedging assets, the bubble's duration was shorter, and the positive feedback mechanism was not as strong as that of the 2017 bubble. In addition, the oscillating frequency of the bubble in 2019 was low and unstable, which means that it would be more beneficial for investors to hold the currency for a long time.","[Yao, Can-Zhong; Li, Hong-Yu] South China Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China","South China University of Technology","Yao, CZ (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.","ycz20120911@gmail.com","","","National Social Science Foundation of China [19BJL086]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China [2019A1515010471]; Soft science research program of Guangdong Province [2020A1010020005]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2019MS082, ZDPY202025]","National Social Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Soft science research program of Guangdong Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This research was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 19BJL086), Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China (Grant 2019A1515010471), Soft science research program of Guangdong Province (Grant 2020A1010020005), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant 2019MS082, ZDPY202025).","","43","4","4","4","9","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1062-9408","1879-0860","","N AM J ECON FINANC","N.

In the recent years, cryptocurrencies (also known as a system of electronic transaction) have caught significant attention from governments, policymakers, and practitioners worldwide. Cryptocurrencies as an innovative method of exchanges without any physical form boast several potential benefits such as speedy transactions, cross-border usage, low transaction fee, transparency, high security, anonymity, and privacy, and thus are expected to bring huge revolution in the future economic system. This study aims to investigate the adoption factors of Bitcoin, a most known cryptocurrency in China. Based on Technology Acceptance Model, a research framework has been developed to test the proposed hypotheses. The data have been collected via a survey questionnaire from 385 Chinese respondents. The findings show that the perceived ease of use and the perceived usefulness have a positive relationship with the intention to use Bitcoin. The perceived usefulness mediates the relationship between the perceived ease of use and the intention to use Bitcoin. Furthermore, the results reveal that the transaction processing and the perceived ease of use have significant impacts on the perceived usefulness. However, the security and control shows an insignificant effect on the perceived usefulness. This study contributes to the growing literature of Bitcoin and offers valuable information to individual users (payees), fund managers (investors), and companies/businesses (receiving Bitcoin as a payment method).

The maximal overlap discrete wavelet transformation first decomposes the original series into granular linear and nonlinear components. We then fit polynomial regression with interaction (PRI) and support vector regression (SVR) on linear and nonlinear components and obtain component-wise projections. The sum of these projections constitutes the final forecast. For accurate predictions, the PRI coefficients and tuning of the hyperparameters of SVR must be precisely estimated. Differential evolution, a metaheuristic optimization technique, helps to achieve these goals. We compare the forecast accuracy of the proposed regression framework with six advanced predictive modeling algorithms- multilayer perceptron neural network, random forest, adaptive neural fuzzy inference system, standalone SVR, multiple adaptive regression spline, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Finally, we perform the numerical experimentation based on-(1) the daily closing prices of Bitcoin for January 10, 2013, to February 23, 2019, and (2) randomly generated surrogate time series through Monte Carlo analysis. The forecast accuracy of the proposed framework is higher than the other predictive modeling algorithms.","[Jana, R.

The pruned node is a lightweight full node as it can independently verify new transactions and blocks received from other peers in the Bitcoin network by only maintaining some recently verified blocks (not the complete blockchain) and the complete Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) set. However, the rapid increase in the size of the UTXO set has caused the main part of the UTXO set to be stored in the low-speed disk, and thus slows down the verification speed of new blocks in lightweight full nodes. Existing verification schemes for pruned nodes do not take advantage of the fact that different UTXO-related transactions are included in a new block with different probabilities, resulting in poor verification performance. In this paper, we propose a prediction-based UTXO cache optimization mechanism to increase the verification speed of new blocks. In order to achieve higher prediction accuracy and reduce the memory requirements of UTXO set, we first design a method to synchronize unconfirmed transactions for lightweight full nodes to ensure that the local and miners' unconfirmed transaction sets are highly consistent. Then, a lightweight full node predicts which unconfirmed transactions will have a greater probability of appearing in the new block by utilizing the fact that most miners will prioritize unconfirmed transactions to maximize the total transaction fee when mining a new block. Based on this mechanism, we can pre-load the UTXOs required for new block verification into the memory, thereby greatly improving the verification performance. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can accelerate the block verification of lightweight full nodes with small memory requirements.","[Niu, Yukun; Li, Haixing; Zhang, Chi; Wei, Lingbo] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Hefei 230027, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Wei, Lingbo] China Nanhu Acad Elect & Informat Technol, Jiaxing 314001, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Niu, YK (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Hefei 230027, Anhui, Peoples R China.","xiaoniu@mail.ustc.edu.cn; lihaixing@mail.ustc.edu.cn; chizhang@ustc.edu.cn; lingbowei@ustc.edu.cn","zhang, chi/GRX-3610-2022","","Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [62072426, 61871362, U19B2023]; Key Research and Development Program of Anhui [202104b1102002 9]","Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research and Development Program of Anhui","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grants 62072426, 61871362, and U19B2023, and by the Key Research and Development Program of Anhui under Grant 202104b1102002 9.","","12","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2334-0983","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8104-2","IEEE GLOB COMM CONF","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685843","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685843","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BT0PJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000790747204078","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Intraday price fluctuations of Bitcoin are represented by three measures of realized volatility, viz. total variance, upside semivariance, and downside semivariance. Our empirical analysis relies on a quantile regression framework, after orthogonalizing raw returns with respect to an array of relevant global factors and accounting for structural shifts in the series. The results suggest that developed-market returns are positively related to the realized variance proxy across various market conditions, while emerging-market returns are positively (negatively) correlated with realized variance during bear (normal and bull) market periods. The upside (downside) component of realized variance has a negative (positive) influence on returns of either market category, and the dependence structure is highly asymmetric across the return distribution.

The protocol has been shown to be vulnerable to refund attacks due to lack of authentication of the refund addresses. In this paper, we give the first formal model of the protocol and formalise the refund address security goals for the protocol, namely refund address authentication and secrecy. The formal model utilises communication channels as abstractions conveying security goals on which the protocol modeller and verifier can rely. We analyse the Payment Protocol confirming that it is vulnerable to an attack violating the refund address authentication security goal. Moreover, we present a concrete protocol revision proposal supporting the merchant with publicly verifiable evidence that can mitigate the attack. We verify that the revised protocol meets the security goals defined for the refund address.

Based on the prices and following Wilder's algorithm, the average directional movement index was calculated, and upward and downward trend periods were determined. No long-term relationship was found to exist between the strength of a trend and the volume in both bearish and bullish markets. Hence, trends do not react to volume changes. However, a long-term relationship exists between volume and trend-but only for the downward trend-with an adjustment speed of 88%. In the short-term, a statistically significant but very weak dependency is revealed; hence, the conclusion that trend strength is insensitive to volume changes can be reached.","[Szetela, Beata; Mentel, Grzegorz; Mentel, Urszula] Rzeszow Univ Technol, Rzeszow, Poland; [Bilan, Yuriy] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econom, Zlin, Czech Republic","Rzeszow University of Technology; Tomas Bata University Zlin","Bilan, Y (corresponding author), Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econom, Zlin, Czech Republic.","beata@prz.edu.pl; gmentel@prz.edu.pl; y.bilan@prz.edu.pl; u.mentel@prz.edu.pl","Bilan, Yuriy/ABC-6948-2021; Mentel, Grzegorz/T-1850-2018; Szetela, Beata/ABG-7631-2021; Mentel, Urszula/AAM-2725-2020","Mentel, Grzegorz/0000-0002-6371-1219; Szetela, Beata/0000-0002-7421-2378; Mentel, Urszula/0000-0003-2060-8980","","","","","72","4","4","3","5","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","1309-422X","2147-429X","","EURASIAN ECON REV","Eurasian Econ.

The finding of the rolling window test indicates that there is causality in different subsamples. It has found both positive and negative bidirectional causalities between GEPU and BCP across various subsamples. The decision makers need to accelerate the development of blockchain technology that can be used for hedging and portfolio diversification. Moreover, enacting laws and regulations on state interventions and prohibitions ensures investor confidence. Information about policy changes should be incorporated into portfolio selection to avoid random market fluctuations. Its unregulated nature makes it more turbulent in the short term and has undergone sudden changes, so investors should be able to obtain comprehensive information about global economic and policy changes.

In addition, with miners' financial interest playing a significant role in choosing transactions from the backlog, small fee or small fee per byte value transactions will exhibit more delays. To study the issues related to the system's performance, we developed an M(t)/M-N /1 model. The backlog's arrival follows an inhomogeneous Poison process to the system that has infinite buffer capacity, and the service time is distributed exponentially, which removes N transactions at time. Besides validating the model with measurement data, we have used the model to study the reward distribution when miners take transaction selection strategies like fee per byte, fee-based, and FIFO. The analysis shows that smaller fee transactions exhibit higher waiting times, even with increasing the block size. Moreover, the miner transaction selection strategy impacts the final gain.","[Gebraselase, Befekadu G.; Helvik, Bjarne E.; Jiang, Yuming] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, NTNU, Dept Informat Secur & Commun Technol, Trondheim, Norway","Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)","Gebraselase, BG (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, NTNU, Dept Informat Secur & Commun Technol, Trondheim, Norway.","befekadu.gebraselase@ntnu.no; bjarne@ntnu.no; yuming.jiang@ntnu.no","","Helvik, Bjarne E./0000-0001-6969-4571","","","","","42","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-1760-0","","","","2021","","","","","","","521","529","","10.1109/BLOCKCHAIN53845.2021.00079","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BLOCKCHAIN53845.2021.00079","","","9","","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","","BS9CN","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000779214600067","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We use daily data for the period January 2010-May 2020, which covers the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Empirical results show that the dynamic correlation between Bitcoin and Islamic stock markets is low and usually negative during major economic and political events suggesting that Bitcoin qualifies as a safe haven against Islamic stock markets downturns. Extending our analysis to portfolio management, findings reveal that the diversification benefits of Bitcoin are most times stable and increase significantly during turbulent periods. Thereby, adding Bitcoin in a portfolio of Islamic stocks reduce the risk of portfolio. Finally, as regards the COVID-19 outbreak period, we find that the hedging strategy involving Bitcoin leads to a higher cost during the crisis.

Both bitcoins and gold rose sharply during 2020, thanks to the relentless press of fiat money by governments and central banks that intend to keep their economies afloat as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. As digital gold, BTC appeals to the cashless Internet economy largely for its features, which include continuous price transparency and a lack of restrictions, disruptions or third-party oversight. The paper focuses on the analysis and identification of the relationship between the value of basic cryptocurrencies and gold price movements, as well as the research hypothesis that the value of the most known and used cryptocurrency bitcoin (BTC) increases with the rising price of gold - a special commodity that serves several functions of the world economy. This issue is currently gaining more and more attention also in context of risk management which is the identification, evaluation, and prioritization of risks followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events or to maximize the realization of opportunities and mobile commerce in the aspect of the impact of modern technologies and mobile communication platforms on consumer behavior and consumer preferences. Innovatively, we have made our observations of the price of bitcoin in relation to price fluctuations in the gold markets in order to develop a predictive model for simulating the development of the price of bitcoin.

It has long been a pivot point of attention for investors who are in pursuit of a safe haven asset. In this paper, we use the wavelet-based quantile-on-quantile method, and the quantile-based Granger causality method, in order to investigate the notion of Bitcoin in actually being a safe-haven asset, amid political and economic uncertainty in the US for the period between 2010:M06, and 2020: M10. Using the Partisan Conflict Index (PCI), and the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPU) as proxies of uncertainties, we find that although Bitcoin effectively appears to be a safe haven asset when uncertainties are on the rise, however, this relationship tends to change during the short- to long-run. In this regard, our sample provides us with a unique opportunity to evaluate the safe haven hypothesis for Bitcoin, amid a time span with three Presidential elections in the US, and recently, an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, which has been declared as a global pandemic. We have also supplemented our analysis with the bootstrap rolling window causality method, as a measure of robustness. In light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and the dynamic economic situation, our work provides valuable knowledge for investors, who wish to construct investment portfolios based on Bitcoin, and also provide insights for regulators about how to regulate the cryptocurrency speculation in an effective manner.","[Umar, Muhammad; Su, Chi-Wei] Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Rizvi, Syed Kumail Abbas] Lahore Sch Econ, Fac Business Adm, Lahore, Pakistan; [Shao, Xue-Feng] Univ Newcastle, Law & Business Fac, Sch Management, Newcastle, NSW, Australia","Qingdao University; Lahore School of Economics; University of Newcastle","Su, CW (corresponding author), Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.","umar@qdu.edu.cn; cwsu7137@gmail.com; kumail@lahoreschool.edu.pk; david.shao@newcastle.edu.au","Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021; Rizvi, Syed Kumail Abbas/AAR-2381-2021; Umar, Muhammad/AFG-9168-2022","Umar, Muhammad/0000-0001-5773-5954; Su, Chi Wei/0000-0001-9722-8105; Shao, Xuefeng/0000-0002-4267-9600; Shao, Xuefeng/0000-0002-1278-8398; Rizvi, Syed Kumail Abbas/0000-0003-1246-0912","National Social Science Fund of China [20BJY021]","National Social Science Fund of China","This research is partly supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (20BJY021).","","70","64","64","16","69","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","0040-1625","1873-5509","","TECHNOL FORECAST SOC","Technol.

This paper presents the first study on time-frequency domain connectedness and hedging among five hedges (Bitcoin, crude oil, commodities, gold and the U.S. dollar (USD) index) and four stock indices (developed markets ex U.S., emerging markets ex China, U.S. and China). We find that the connectedness between hedges and stock markets varies by time across time horizons. Specifically, the connectedness between Bitcoin and stock indices is the smallest among all hedges, especially for the short horizon. Gold and USD are isolated from other markets at longer horizons. The hedging ratio, optimal portfolio weights and hedging effectiveness also vary across investment horizons. For short-term investment, gold has better hedging effectiveness, especially for emerging stock markets and the U.S. stock market. For median- and long-term investment, USD has better performance, especially for developed markets ex U.S. and emerging stock markets. Additionally, although Bitcoin has good hedging properties, it has high volatility compared with other hedging assets. In other words, if Bitcoin is included in a portfolio, investors should pay attention to its wide variation. These empirical findings highlight the important role that gold and USD play in hedging against global stock markets.","[Wang, Peijin] Duke Univ, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Wang, Peijin; Zhang, Hongwei; Guo, Yaoqi] Cent South Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hongwei; Guo, Yaoqi] Cent South Univ, Inst Met Resources Strategy, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China; [Yang, Cai] Hunan Univ, Sch Business Adm, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China","Duke University; Central South University; Central South University; Hunan University","Zhang, HW (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China.","pj.wang@duke.edu; hongwei@csu.edu.cn; yangcaier@hnu.edu.cn; guoyaoqi@csu.edu.cn","","","Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2020JJ5784]; InnovationDriven Project of Central South University [2020CX049]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [72074228, 71874210, 71633006, 71874207, 71974208]","Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); InnovationDriven Project of Central South University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [grant number 2020JJ5784], the InnovationDriven Project of Central South University [grant number 2020CX049], and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 72074228, 71874210, 71633006, 71874207, 71974208].","","66","8","8","6","22","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0275-5319","1878-3384","","RES INT BUS FINANC","Res.

To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, Forecast Error (FE), Mean Forecast Error (MFE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), as well as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), are considered in our study.","[Rostami, Marzieh] Raja Univ Qazvin, Dept Informat Technol Engn, Qazvin, Iran; [Bahaghighat, Mahdi; Mohammadi Zanjireh, Morteza] Imam Khomeini Int Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Qazvin, Iran","Imam Khomeini International University","Rostami, M (corresponding author), Raja Univ Qazvin, Dept Informat Technol Engn, Qazvin, Iran.","mrz.rst@gmail.com; Bahaghighat@eng.ikiu.ac.ir; Zanjireh@eng.ikiu.ac.ir","","","","","","","44","0","0","2","3","SCIENDO","WARSAW","BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND","1844-6086","2066-7760","","ACTA U SAPIEN INFORM","Acta Univ.

The research sample covers five years and includes several downturns on the financial markets, starting from the Chinese stock market turbulences in 2015/2016 and ending up with the recent pandemic outbreak in 2020. We find that only gold used to be a strong safe-haven against the stock market indices. Yet, this property evaporated during the crisis caused by the COVID pandemic. Occasionally, cryptocurrencies could have been considered weak safe-havens against the examined instruments.

Therefore, investors seek an alternative investment that generates profits during this financially risky situation. Cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, has become a new currency tool for speculators and investors, and it is expected to be used in future exchanges. Therefore, this paper uses a Value at Risk (VaR) model to measure the risk of investment in Bitcoin. In this paper, we showed the results of the predicted daily loss of investment by using the historical simulation VaR model, the delta-normal VaR model, and the Monte Carlo simulation VaR model with the confidence levels of 99%, 95%, and 90%. This paper displayed backtesting methods to investigate the accuracy of VaR models, which consisted of the Kupiec's POF and the Kupiec's TUFF statistical testing results. Finally, Christoffersen's independence test and Christoffersen's interval forecasts evaluation showed effectiveness in the predictions for the robustness of VaR models for each confidence level.","[Likitratcharoen, Danai; Wiwattanalamphong, Karawan; Pinmanee, Chakrin] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Business Adm, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Kronprasert, Nopadon] Chiang Mai Univ, Excellence Ctr Infrastruct Technol & Transport Ex, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Kronprasert, Nopadon] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand","Chiang Mai University; Chiang Mai University; Chiang Mai University","Likitratcharoen, D (corresponding author), Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Business Adm, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.","danai.l@cmu.ac.th; nopkron@eng.cmu.ac.th; wiwattanalamphong@hotmail.com; chakrin_p@cmu.ac.th","","Kronprasert, Nopadon/0000-0003-1360-2097","Excellence Center in Infrastructure Technology and Transportation Engineering (ExCITE) of Chiang Mai University","Excellence Center in Infrastructure Technology and Transportation Engineering (ExCITE) of Chiang Mai University","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the research project from the Excellence Center in Infrastructure Technology and Transportation Engineering (ExCITE) of Chiang Mai University.","","45","0","0","3","4","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-9091","","RISKS","Risks","DEC","2021","9","12","","","","","","","222","10.3390/risks9120222","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/risks9120222","","","16","Business, Finance","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Business & Economics","YB1MG","","Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000738784700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Litigation funding covers litigant's lawsuit-related expenses using the legal outcome as collateral. This study investigates the dynamic relationship between litigation funding, Gold, Bitcoin and the stock market using data from July 2015 to July 2020. Three important findings emerge by employing return spillover effects, Markov regime-switches and dynamic correlations; (1) litigation funding and the stock market share a lower degree of correlation with each other; (2) capital started flowing away from the stock market to litigation funding after the COVID-19 market shock; and (3) the dynamic correlations between litigation funding and Gold (Bitcoin) started increasing (decreasing) after the COVID-19 market shock. Because the judgement or settlement amount is a contingent outcome, litigation funding is immune from the market shocks, and relevant for portfolio diversification and other investment strategies.","[Singh, Amanjot] Deakin Univ, Dept Finance, Geelong, Vic 3125, Australia","Deakin University","Singh, A (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Dept Finance, Geelong, Vic 3125, Australia.","amanjotsingh@deakin.edu.au","","Singh, Amanjot/0000-0003-3575-4382; Singh, Amanjot/0000-0002-0828-2749","","","","","51","3","3","2","13","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0264-9993","1873-6122","","ECON MODEL","Econ.

Design/methodology/approach This paper offers a crucial viewpoint to the predictive capacity of COVID-19 surprises and production pronouncements for the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) among Bitcoin and Gold returns and volatilities using generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity-DCC-(1,1) through the period of study since July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020. To assess the unexpected impact of COVID-19, this study pursues the Kuttner's (2001) methodology. Findings The empirical findings indicate strong important correlation among Bitcoin and Gold if COVID-19 surprises are integrated in variance. This study validates the financialization hypothesis of Bitcoin and Gold. The correlation between Bitcoin and Gold begin to react significantly further in the case of COVID-19 surprises in USA than those in China.

In this paper, we analyse the structure of the BLN over a period of 18 months, ranging from 12th January 2018 to 17th July 2019, at the end of which the network has reached 8.216 users, 122.517 active channels and 2.732,5 transacted bitcoins. Here, we consider three representations of the BLN: the daily snapshot one, the weekly snapshot one and the daily-block snapshot one. By studying the topological properties of the binary and weighted versions of the three representations above, we find that the total volume of transacted bitcoins approximately grows as the square of the network size; however, despite the huge activity characterising the BLN, the bitcoins distribution is very unequal: the average Gini coefficient of the node strengths (computed across the entire history of the Bitcoin Lightning Network) is, in fact, similar or equal to 0.88 causing the 10% (50%) of the nodes to hold the 80% (99%) of the bitcoins at stake in the BLN (on average, across the entire period). This concentration brings up the question of which minimalist network model allows us to explain the network topological structure. Like for other economic systems, we hypothesise that local properties of nodes, like the degree, ultimately determine part of its characteristics. Therefore, we have tested the goodness of the undirected binary configuration model (UBCM) in reproducing the structural features of the BLN: the UBCM recovers the disassortative and the hierarchical character of the BLN but underestimates the centrality of nodes; this suggests that the BLN is becoming an increasingly centralised network, more and more compatible with a core-periphery structure. Further inspection of the resilience of the BLN shows that removing hubs leads to the collapse of the network into many components, an evidence suggesting that this network may be a target for the so-called split attacks.","[Lin, Jian-Hong; Tessone, Claudio J.] Univ Zurich, URPP Social Networks, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Lin, Jian-Hong] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Scheuchzerstr 7, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Lin, Jian-Hong; Tessone, Claudio J.] Univ Zurich, UZH Blockchain Ctr, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Primicerio, Kevin] Univ Paris Saclay, CentraleSupelec, Math & Informat Complexite & Syst, FR-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Squartini, Tiziano] IMT Sch Adv Studies Lucca, Piazza San Francesco 19, I-55100 Lucca, Italy; [Decker, Christian] Blockstream Corp Inc, Montreal, PQ H4M 2X6, Canada","University of Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Zurich; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca","Squartini, T (corresponding author), IMT Sch Adv Studies Lucca, Piazza San Francesco 19, I-55100 Lucca, Italy.","tiziano.squartini@imtlucca.it","","","","","","","1","0","0","0","1","IOP PUBLISHING LTD","BRISTOL","TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","1367-2630","","","NEW J PHYS","New J.

As the interest in these digital currencies is growing, many vendors around the globe now accept payments in blockchain-based currencies. However, not much is known about how individuals around the world would react to using blockchain-based currencies as spending currencies. Given the global reach of these currencies, in this study, we explore the role of national cultural values in influencing individuals' willingness to use blockchain-based currencies. To do so, we collected survey data from the U.S. and India.

We infer that such impressive findings might result from temporary rising (falling) prices likely manipulated for appealing to investors pursuing long (short) positions. As a result, investors may realize profit instead of suffering loss frequently by adopting take-profit exits since mean reversion might often occur after such manipulation.

Currently, the interest in Bitcoin has grown, for traders and the general public. However, its high volatility represents a challenge in terms of prediction models for day-trade operations. In this way, recent studies have been proposed to predict the Bitcoin price direction for day-trade operations, but the maximum accuracy obtained was around 57.5%. In order to contribute and advance the state-of-the-art, this article experiences the impact of use Blockchain data, international economic indices, social trends information and technical indicators to overcome the predictions of the Bitcoin price direction. Thus, it is proposed a methodology based on data collection and processing, where weighted moving averages (for the Blockchain data, economic indices and social media trends) and technical indicators (considering the Bitcoin exchange rate data) were extracted/calculated from the original databases. The attributes were submitted to the Information Gain algorithm to select the most relevant ones. In the sequence, Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks models were used to predict the Bitcoin price direction for day-trade purposes. As a result, it was possible to obtain an average accuracy of 63.84% in a 1-year prediction period, overcoming other related studies.","[Mallqui, Dennys C. A.; Fernandes, Ricardo A.

However, the security of these schemes relies totally on enclaves. Since private keys of all channel funds are kept by both payment channel participants' enclaves, a malicious participant can steal funds from the counterparty by defeating her own enclave. To solve the above problem, we present a novel TEE-based payment channel scheme that transfers the responsibility of running enclaves from participants to a third party committee, while relieving both participants from monitoring the blockchain at the same time. Furthermore, since committee members can try to steal funds by defeating their own enclaves, we exploit the additive homomorphic property of signature keys in Elliptic Curve Cryptography to design a novel secret sharing scheme to tolerate a subset of committee members to be malicious. By using the above secret sharing scheme, private keys of the channel funds are never constructed in any committee member's enclave, so that a malicious committee member cannot steal funds by defeating his own enclave. Finally, experiment shows our scheme can ensure payment channel funds security without efficient compromises compared with existing TEE-based payment channel schemes.","[Xie, Yankai; Zhang, Chi; Wei, Lingbo; Wang, Qingtao; Yang, Zhe] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Cyber Sci & Technol, Hefei 230027, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Wei, Lingbo] China Nanhu Acad Elect & Informat Techol, Jiaxing 314001, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Xie, YK (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Cyber Sci & Technol, Hefei 230027, Anhui, Peoples R China.","ykxie@mail.ustc.edu.cn; chizhang@ustc.edu.cn; lingbowei@ustc.edu.cn; wqt@mail.ustc.edu.cn; yzpag@mail.ustc.edu.cn","zhang, chi/GRX-3610-2022","","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFB0804201]; Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61702474, 62072426, U19B2023, 61871362]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under grant 2018YFB0804201, and by the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under grants 61702474, 62072426, U19B2023, and 61871362.","","10","0","0","0","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1550-3607","","978-1-7281-7122-7","IEEE ICC","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500569","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500569","","","6","Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Telecommunications","BS4HX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000719386002004","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Due to the randomness and the competitiveness of mining, individual miners tend to join mining pools for low risks and steady incomes. Usually, a pool is managed by its central operator. who charges fees for providing risk-sharing services. This paper presents a hierarchical distributed computation paradigm where miners can distribute their power among multiple pools. By adding virtual pools, we separate miners' dual roles of being the operator as well as being the member when solo mining. We formulate a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game to study the joint utility maximization of pool operators and miners, thereby addressing a computation power allocation problem. We investigate two practical pool operation modes, a uniform-share-difficulty mode and a nonuniform-share-difficulty mode. We derive analytical results for the Stackelberg equilibrium of the game under both modes, based on which optimal strategies are designed for all operators and miners. Numerical evaluations are presented to verify the proposed model.","[Jiang, Suhan; Wu, Jie] Temple Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University","Jiang, SH (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.","suhan.jiang@temple.edu; jiewu@temple.edu","","","NSF [CNS 2128378, CNS 2107014, CNS 1824440, CNS 1828363, CNS 1757533, CNS 1629746, CNS 1651947]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was supported in part by NSF grants CNS 2128378, CNS 2107014, CNS 1824440, CNS 1828363, CNS 1757533, CNS 1629746, and CNS 1651947.","","20","0","0","3","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2474-025X","","978-1-6654-4496-5","IEEE CONF COMM NETW","","","2021","","","","","","","83","91","","10.1109/CNS53000.2021.9705053","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CNS53000.2021.9705053","","","9","Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BT0EU","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000786954200016","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The results show that the return transmissions vary across the two periods for both pairs. There is a unidirectional volatility spill-over from gold to oil in the pre-COVID-19 period, and from oil to gold during the COVID-19 period. There is a significant volatility spill-over from Bitcoin to oil during the pre-COVID-19 period, whereas no evidence of volatility spill-over between oil and Bitcoin is shown during the COVID-19 period. Based on optimal weights, investors should increase their investments in, (a) gold for a portfolio of oil-gold, and (b) Bitcoin for a portfolio of oil-Bitcoin during the COVID-19 period. All hedge ratios are higher during the COVID-19 period, implying a higher hedging cost compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. The results of hedging effectiveness reveal that the risk-adjusted returns can be improved by constructing a portfolio of oil-gold and oil-Bitcoin during both sample periods.

After examining 13,918 tweets from January 2017 to January 2020, we find that negative sentiment is a predictive factor for Bitcoin returns, trading volumes, realized volatility, and jumps. In addition, only negative sentiment has a Granger-causal relation with volatility. We also find that Trump's Twitter sentiment can influence the Bitcoin market in the form of time-varying dependence. This paper also extended the COVID-19 period and found that Trump's sentiment can be a predictive tool to the Bitcoin market during the pandemic.

From shells, to metals, to paper, the technology of money has continually evolved to meet the changing needs of human society. The twenty-first century is witnessing yet another evolution in the technology of money: digital currencies. Although political economy scholarship has begun to focus on digital currencies, this research has largely focused on single early examples like Bitcoin. I argue that this generally narrow focus has obscured important degrees of variation among digital currencies and, by extension, has omitted important lines of research on digital currencies as a familiar evolution in the technology of money. In this article, I revisit the history of digital currencies with explicit attention to not only economic inefficiencies but also political power structures and offer a new typology for theoretically organizing digital currencies along dimensions relevant to practitioners of political economy. I illustrate that variation along these typological dimensions produces important differences among different digital currencies and, relatedly, I explore the implications this has for digital currencies' externalities and governance demands. Drawing on this typology, I conclude with a proposed research agenda for the political economy of digital currencies.","[Marple, Tim] Univ Calif Berkeley, Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","University of California System; University of California Berkeley","Marple, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.","timarple@berkeley.edu","","Marple, Tim/0000-0001-5047-6689","","","","","100","1","1","8","45","CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND","","1469-3569","","BUS POLIT","Bus.

The probabilistic analysis of the model highlights how forks happen and how they depend on specific parameters of the protocol, such as the difficulty of the cryptopuzzle and the network communication delays. Our results confirm that considering transactions in blocks at depth larger than 5 as confirmed is reasonable because the majority of miners have consistent blockchains up-to that depth with probability of almost 1.

The VAR model is employed to investigate whether investor sentiment and Bitcoin returns are related in a dynamic setting and to make distinguish between rational and irrational investor sentiments. The results from the VAR model show that both rational and irrational investor sentiments have an impact on Bitcoin returns indicating that the Bitcoin market is also driven by emotions and noise traders have an impact on the data generating process of Bitcoin returns.

This paper aims to propose a new method for predicting the direction of BTC price using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) together with sentiment analysis. Design/methodology/approach Concretely, the authors train an LDA-based classifier that uses the current BTC price information and BTC news announcements headlines to forecast the next-day direction of BTC prices. The authors compare the results with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and random guess approach. The use of BTC price information and news announcements related to crypto enables us to value the importance of these different sources and types of information. Findings Relative to the LDA results, the SVM model was more accurate in predicting BTC next day's price movement. All models yielded better forecasts of an increase in tomorrow's BTC price compared to forecasting a decrease in the crypto price. The inclusion of news sentiment resulted in the highest forecast accuracy of 0.585 on the test data, which is superior to a random guess. The LDA (SVM) model with asset specific (news sentiment and asset specific) input features ranked first within their respective model classifiers, suggesting both BTC news sentiment and asset specific are prized factors in predicting tomorrow's price direction. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the potential effect of crypto-related sentiment and BTC specific news on BTC's price using LDA and sentiment analysis.","[Gurrib, Ikhlaas] Canadian Univ Dubai, Sch Grad Studies, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Kamalov, Firuz] Canadian Univ Dubai, Fac Engn & Architecture, Dubai, U Arab Emirates","Canadian University Dubai; Canadian University Dubai","Gurrib, I (corresponding author), Canadian Univ Dubai, Sch Grad Studies, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.","ikhlaas@cud.ac.ae","; Gurrib, Ikhlaas/D-4831-2018","Kamalov, Firuz/0000-0003-3946-0920; Gurrib, Ikhlaas/0000-0001-8393-9790","","","","","70","1","1","8","19","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1086-7376","1755-6791","","STUD ECON FINANC","Stud.

This paper focuses on examining information spillover from epidemic-related news to the crude oil, gold, and Bitcoin markets with the time-frequency analysis method. The empirical results reveal that both the return and volatility spillovers from epidemic-related news to the crude oil, gold, and Bitcoin markets are stronger in the short term (less than 1 week). In the long term, only the media sentiment index notably impacts crude oil, gold, and Bitcoin market returns. The volatility spillover from media coverage to crude oil mainly occurs in the short term. Regarding the gold and Bitcoin markets, the long-term volatility spillovers are significant. An obvious risk contagion path is found. Media hype is the main risk transmitter and transmits vast shocks to these three markets, especially the Bitcoin market, which subsequently transmits these shocks to the gold market. Risk accumulates systemically in the gold and Bitcoin markets. These findings have crucial empirical implications for policymakers and investors when formulating related short- or long-term decisions during the pandemic.","[Zhang, Hongwei; Hong, Huojun; Guo, Yaoqi] Cent South Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hongwei; Guo, Yaoqi] Cent South Univ, Inst Met Resources Strategy, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China; [Yang, Cai] Hunan Univ, Business Sch, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China","Central South University; Central South University; Hunan University","Yang, C (corresponding author), Hunan Univ, Business Sch, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China.","hongwei@csu.edu.cn; honghuojun@163.com; guoyaoqi@csu.edu.cn; yangcaier@hnu.edu.cn","Yossinomita, Yossinomita/GOH-1070-2022","Yossinomita, Yossinomita/0000-0002-2190-8128; cai, yang/0000-0002-4127-680X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [72074228, 71874210, 71633006]; Chinese National Funding of Social Sciences [19BJY076, 18ZDA061]; Innovation Driven Project of Central South University [2020CX049]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese National Funding of Social Sciences; Innovation Driven Project of Central South University","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 72074228, 71874210 and 71633006) , Chinese National Funding of Social Sciences (Nos. 19BJY076, 18ZDA061) and the Innovation Driven Project of Central South University (No. 2020CX049) .","","52","4","4","6","26","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1059-0560","1873-8036","","INT REV ECON FINANC","Int.

We use a quantile regression approach, after orthogonalizing raw equity returns with respect to a variety of relevant global factors and accounting for structural breaks in the data. For developed markets, the results indicate that upside volatility tends to exert contemporaneous and lagged negative influences on Islamic stocks more in bear than in bull market conditions, whereas the downside counterpart positively affects returns when Sharia-compliant equities are in bear and bull phases. For emerging markets, we find that Bitcoin's upside (downside) volatility has lagged negative (positive) effects on returns across all market regimes. The dependence structures tend to be asymmetric and have noticeably become stronger in the last two years than in earlier periods of the sample.

Design/methodology/approach The author employs the Bayesian structural vector autoregression to examine the phenomenon in Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin from 2nd January 2020 to 30th June 2021. A similar analysis is conducted for major stock indices, namely S&P 500, FTSE 100 and SSE Composite for comparison purposes. Findings The results suggest that cryptocurrencies returns suffered immensely in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak following declarations of the disease as a global health emergency and eventually a pandemic in March 2020. However, the returns for all three cryptocurrencies recovered by April 2020 and remained resistant to further COVID-19 panic shocks. The results are dissimilar to those of S&P 500, FTSE 100 and SSE Composite values which were vulnerable to COVID-19 panic throughout the timeframe to June 2021. The results further reveal strong predictive power of Bitcoin on prices of other cryptocurrencies. Research limitations/implications The article provides evidence to support the cryptocurrency as a safe haven during COVID-19 school of thought given their resistance to subsequent shocks during COVID-19. Thus, the author stresses the need for diversification of investment portfolios by including cryptocurrencies given their uniqueness and resistance to shocks during crises.

These models, however, largely overlooked the impact of the realistic network synchronization, which can be manipulated given the permissionless nature of the network. In this paper, we revisit the security of Bitcoin blockchain by incorporating the network synchronization into the security model and evaluating that in practice. Towards this goal, we propose the ideal functionality for the Bitcoin network synchronization and specify bounds on the network outdegree and the block propagation delay in order to preserve the consistency property. By contrasting the ideal functionality against measurements, we find deteriorating network synchronization reported by Bitnodes and a notable churn rate with approximate to 10% of the nodes arriving and departing from the network daily. Motivated by these findings, we propose SyncAttack, an attack that allows an adversary to violate the Bitcoin blockchain consistency property and double-spend without using any mining power. Moreover, during our measurements, we discover weaknesses in Bitcoin that can be exploited to reduce the cost of SyncAttack, deanonymize Bitcoin transactions, and reduce the effective network hash rate. We also observe events that suggest malicious nodes are exploiting those weaknesses in the network. Finally, we patch those weaknesses to mitigate SyncAttack and associated risks.","[Saad, Muhammad; Mohaisen, David] Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Chen, Songqing] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; George Mason University","Saad, M (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.","saad.ucf@knights.ucf.edu; sqchen@gmu.edu; mohaisen@ucf.edu","Mohaisen, David/GQP-2695-2022","","NRF [2016K1A1A2912757]; NSF [CNS-2007153]; Commonwealth Cyber Initiative grant","NRF; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Commonwealth Cyber Initiative grant","This work is supported in part by NRF grant 2016K1A1A2912757.

Providing uncertainty quantification besides the predictive probability is desirable to reflect the degree of belief in the model's decision about a given input. Recently, Monte-Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) method has been introduced as a probabilistic approach based Bayesian approximation which is computationally efficient than Bayesian neural networks. MC-dropout has revealed promising results on image datasets regarding uncertainty quantification. However, this method has been subjected to criticism regarding the behaviour of MC-dropout and what type of uncertainty it actually captures. For this purpose, we aim to discuss the behaviour of MC-dropout on classification tasks using synthetic and real data. We empirically explain different cases of MC-dropout that reflects the relative merits of this method. Our main finding is that MC-dropout captures datapoints lying on the decision boundary between the opposed classes using synthetic data. On the other hand, we apply MC-dropout method on dataset derived from Bitcoin known as Elliptic data to highlight the outperformance of model with MC-dropout over standard model.

This paper examines the role of the Morgan Stanley Capital International all-country world index, Islamic index, gold and Bitcoin as a hedge or safe-haven asset for the world conventional stock market over the period from April 30, 2015 to March 27, 2020. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the authors re-evaluate the hedge and safe haven properties of Islamic indexes, gold and Bitcoin following Baur and Lucey's (2010) and Baur and McDermott's (2010) methodology. Findings Empirical results show that the Islamic index is not a hedge or a safe haven asset for the world conventional stock market during the recent coronavirus crisis period. Different from the whole period, the authors find that gold is a strong hedge but only a weak safe or is not a safe haven during the coronavirus sub-period. Bitcoin reports distinctive properties, as it acts as a weak hedge and not a safe-haven asset. Originality/value This paper is the first study that investigates whether the global Islamic index still acts as hedges or safe-haven assets during the new COVID-19 crisis period. The results can help investors make informed decisions when adding cryptocurrencies and Islamic indexes to their portfolios during the coronavirus crisis.","[Bahloul, Slah] Univ Sfax, Higher Inst Business Adm Sfax, Lab Probabil & Stat, Sfax, Tunisia; [Mroua, Mourad] Univ Sfax, Inst Higher Business Studies, Dept Finance Res Lab Probabil & Stat, Sfax, Tunisia; [Naifar, Nader] Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ IMSIQ, Dept Finance & Investment, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Universite de Sfax; Universite de Sfax","Naifar, N (corresponding author), Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ IMSIQ, Dept Finance & Investment, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","doctoratnader@yahoo.fr","Naifar, Nader/AAJ-2859-2020; Bahloul, Slah/AAB-3184-2019","Naifar, Nader/0000-0001-9554-8236; Bahloul, Slah/0000-0001-5939-4639","","","","","44","6","6","2","15","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1753-8394","1753-8408","","INT J ISLAMIC MIDDLE","Int.J.

The bipower variation method suggests that the Bitcoin returns are efficient and contain some large finite jumps. Using MF-DFA, we find that the Bitcoin returns are multifractal and, therefore, the Bitcoin market is not efficient. By carrying out further analysis, we also find that the multifractility and inefficiency are caused by the autocorrelated returns as well as extreme returns.","[Shrestha, Keshab] Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Business, Bandar Sunway 47500, Malaysia","Monash University; Monash University Sunway","Shrestha, K (corresponding author), Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Business, Bandar Sunway 47500, Malaysia.","keshab.shrestha@monash.edu","","","School of Business, Monash University Malaysia","School of Business, Monash University Malaysia","I would like to thank School of Business, Monash University Malaysia for research support.

Furthermore, we conduct one basic and several long horizons out-of-sample forecasts to explore the predictive ability of investor attention. The results show that compared with the traditional historical average benchmark model in forecasting technologies, investor attention improves prediction accuracy in Bitcoin return.

Several authors recognize the potential of cryptocurrencies but also certain deviations with respect to the functions of a conventional currency. Instead, Bitcoin's diversifying factor and its high return potential have generated the attention of portfolio managers. In this context, understanding how its volatility is explained is a critical element of investor decision-making. By modeling the volatility of classic assets, nonlinear models such as Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) offer suitable results. Therefore, taking GARCH(1,1) as a reference point, the main aim of this study is to model and assess the relationship between the Bitcoin volatility and key financial environment variables through a Conditional Correlation (CC) Multivariate GARCH (MGARCH) approach. For this, several commodities, exchange rates, stock market indices, and company stocks linked to cryptocurrencies have been tested. The results obtained show certain heterogeneity in the fit of the different variables, highlighting the uncorrelation with respect to traditional safe haven assets such as gold and oil. Focusing on the CC-MGARCH model, a better behavior of the dynamic conditional correlation is found compared to the constant.","[Cebrian-Hernandez, Angeles] Univ Seville, Dept Appl Econ, Seville 41018, Spain; [Jimenez-Rodriguez, Enrique] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Financial Econ & Accounting, Seville 41013, Spain","University of Sevilla; Universidad Pablo de Olavide","Jimenez-Rodriguez, E (corresponding author), Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Financial Econ & Accounting, Seville 41013, Spain.","mcebrian1@us.es; ejimenez@upo.es","Cebrián-Hernández, Ángeles/AAJ-8826-2021; Jimenez-Rodriguez, Enrique/D-3902-2014","Jimenez-Rodriguez, Enrique/0000-0002-4809-0215","Pablo de Olavide University Research Fund","Pablo de Olavide University Research Fund","The study was supported by the Pablo de Olavide University Research Fund.","","82","9","9","2","13","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-7390","","MATHEMATICS-BASEL","Mathematics","FEB","2021","9","3","","","","","","","267","10.3390/math9030267","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math9030267","","","16","Mathematics","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Mathematics","QD3CV","","Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000615401700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

To overcome the shortcomings of the existing work, more comprehensive features of Bitcoin transaction data were extracted, the unbalanced dataset was equalized, and five supervised methods-the k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) techniques-as well as three unsupervised methods-the local outlier factor (LOF), one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), and Mahalanobis distance-based approach (MDB)-were used for detection. The best performer among these algorithms was the RF algorithm, which achieved recall, precision, and Fl values of 95.9%. The experimental results showed that the designed features are more effective than the currently used ones.

It ensures security and can update the channel to prevent the related problems caused by address reuse. We are taking advantage of the feature of Bitcoin that cannot be double-spent to solve the problem of burning bitcoin when paying bitcoin to a fake public key hash. In our scheme, both parties to the communication are anonymous, and the attacker cannot detect the covert data or track the transaction and address.

Recently, the concept of off-chain transactions is introduced that led to the idea of establishing a payment channel network called Lightning Network (LN), which utilizes multi-hop payments. Off-chain links provide the ability to make instant payments without a need to writing to Blockchain. However, LN's design still favors fees, and it is creating hub nodes or relays that defeat the purpose of Blockchain. In addition, it is still not reliable, as not all transactions are guaranteed to be delivered to their destinations. These issues hinder its wide adoption by retailers. To address this issue, in this paper, we argue that the retailers could create a private payment channel network among them to serve their business needs, just like the concept of private Blockchains. The goal is to build a pure peer-to-peer topology that will prevent the formation of hub nodes while also eliminating the need for any relays to increase the robustness of the payments. Assuming off-chain links as edges and retailers as nodes, we formulate the problem as a multi-flow commodity problem where transactions represent the commodities from various sources to destinations. As the multi-flow commodity problem is NP-Complete, we propose a heuristic approach that utilizes Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for payments in a dynamic way by updating the edge weights when new paths need to be found. The order of transactions is randomized to provide fairness among the retailers. We further extend this approach to guarantee the privacy of payments by forcing all the payments to travel at least three hops. We utilized k-shortest path algorithm to choose from k options that will meet our criterion. The evaluations indicate that the proposed heuristic comes close to an optimal solution while providing scalability and guaranteeing user privacy.","[Erdin, Enes] Univ Cent Arkansas, Comp Sci Dept, Conway, AR 72035 USA; [Cebe, Mumin] Marquette Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA; [Akkaya, Kemal; Uluagac, Selcuk] Florida Int Univ, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Bulut, Eyuphan] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Richmond, VA USA","University of Central Arkansas; Marquette University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Virginia Commonwealth University","Erdin, E (corresponding author), Univ Cent Arkansas, Comp Sci Dept, Conway, AR 72035 USA.","eerdin@uca.edu","Erdin, Enes/AAZ-4970-2021","Erdin, Enes/0000-0003-2979-8143; Cebe, Mumin/0000-0003-2843-8904","National Science Foundation [NSF-CNS-1663051]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This study was partially funded by the National Science Foundation under award number NSF-CNS-1663051.","","26","2","2","1","12","ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","LONDON","24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND","1084-8045","1095-8592","","J NETW COMPUT APPL","J.

Though, Bitcoin is not a fully anonymous environment, rather a pseudonymous one, accounting for a number of attempts to beat its anonymity using clustering techniques. There is, however, a recurring assumption in all the cited deanonymization techniques: that each transaction output has an address attached to it. That assumption is false. An evidence is that, as of block height 591,872, there are several millions transactions with at least one output for which the Bitcoin Core client cannot infer an address. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on sound graph theory for identifying transaction inputs and outputs. Our solution implements two simple yet innovative features: it does not rely on BTC addresses and explores all the transactions stored in the blockchain. All the other existing solutions fail with respect to one or both of the cited features. In detail, we first introduce the concept of Unknown Transaction and provide a new framework to parse the Bitcoin blockchain by taking them into account. Then, we introduce a theoretical model to detect, study, and classify, for the first time in the literature, unknown transaction patterns in the user network. Further, in an extensive experimental campaign, we apply our model to the Bitcoin network to uncover hidden transaction patterns within the Bitcoin user network. Results are striking: we discovered more than 30,000 unknown transaction DAGs representing money flows never observed before. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is the only one that enables a complete study of the unknown transaction patterns, hence enabling further research in the field, for which we provide some directions.","[Caprolu, Maurantonio; Di Pietro, Roberto] Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Qatar Fdn, Div Informat & Comp Technol, Coll Sci & Engn, Doha, Qatar; [Pontecorvi, Matteo; Signorini, Matteo] NOKIA Bell Labs, F-91620 Nozay, France; [Segarra, Carlos] Imperial Coll, London, England","Qatar Foundation (QF); Hamad Bin Khalifa University-Qatar; Nokia Corporation; Imperial College London","Caprolu, M (corresponding author), Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Qatar Fdn, Div Informat & Comp Technol, Coll Sci & Engn, Doha, Qatar.","","","","Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF), a member of The Qatar Foundation [NPRP-S-11-0109-180242]","Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF), a member of The Qatar Foundation","This publication was partially supported by the Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF), a member of The Qatar Foundation, through the award NPRP-S-11-0109-180242 for the project entitled Extending Blockchain Technology a Novel Paradigm and its Applications to Cybersecurity and Fintech.

Firstly, by applying the dynamic time warping algorithm, we identify among several financial instruments a subsample of five assets with similar characteristics to the cryptocurrency bubble. Interestingly, among the fluctuations characterizing these assets, the algorithm shows a close affinity between the Bitcoin bubble and the 2000 NASDAQ Dotcom one. Once the subsample is identified, we study the (de)synchronization among these assets via the wavelet coherence approach. Although Bitcoin is poorly correlated with the other indices, given its scarce connection with the real economy, we observe switching phenomena among these instruments. A more careful study on these portfolio reallocations, conducted via an event study analysis, reveals that traders seem to redirect capital from stock markets and gold to Bitcoin in case of positive events of the cryptocurrency.

New bitcoins are created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that the demand must follow this level of inflation to keep the price stable. Actually, the price is highly volatile, because it is affected by many factors including the supply of bitcoin, its market demand, the cost of the mining process, as well as economic and political world-class news. In this work, we illustrate a novel approach for bitcoin trend prediction, based on the One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN). First, we propose a methodology for building useful datasets that take into account social media data, the full blockchain transaction history, and a number of financial indicators. Moreover, we present a cloud-based system characterized by a highly efficient distributed architecture, which allowed us to collect a huge amount of data in order to build thousands of different datasets, using the aforementioned methodology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses 1D CNN for bitcoin trend prediction. Remarkably, an efficient and low-cost implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNN models that perform one-dimensional convolutions (i.e., scalar multiplications and additions). We show that the 1D CNN model we implemented, trained, validated and tested using the aforementioned datasets, allow one to predict the bitcoin trend with higher accuracy compared to LSTM models. Last but not least, we introduce and simulate a trading strategy based on the proposed 1D CNN model, which increases the profit when the bitcoin trend is bullish and reduces the loss when the trend is bearish.

We identified bitcoin dimensions according to the systematic review of the literature from bibliometric analysis. The data collection instrument involved two interview scripts with a qualitative approach and open responses with the participation of 20 interviewees. Collected data was analyzed through content analysis using dimensions and subdimensions of the Bitcoin ecosystem. We identified the dimensions and subdimensions of Brazilian bitcoin network. The dimensions perceived by the actors were Entrepreneurship, Technology, Regulation, and Social. A total of 15 subdimensions were defined. We conducted a cluster analysis of the subdimensions and the interviewees. Results indicated that for our sample all the dimensions had a similar importance. We did not find any significant difference also among the subdimensions because they are all related to each other. We also didn't find significant difference among interviewees. Mapping of the main dimensions and subdimensions of bitcoin network was presented. The study identified that bitcoin as a technology can be effective for many types of organizations such as financial institutions that are losing market share to startups and FinTechs.","","","","sroseane.almeida@gmail.com; luis.hernan@unifesp.br; marcia.azevedo@unifesp.br; evandro.lopes@unifesp.br","","Contreras Pinochet, Luis Hernan/0000-0003-2088-5283; Azevedo, Marcia/0000-0002-8368-9637","","","","","29","0","0","1","3","CENTRO UNIV SENAC","FLORIANOPOLIS","RUA FELIPE SCHMIDT 785, CENTRO, FLORIANOPOLIS, SC 88010-002, BRAZIL","2237-4558","","","NAVUS-REV GEST TECNO","Navus-Rev.

Design/methodology/approach The authors use a wavelet approach and a quantile-on-quantile regression (QQR) method. Findings The results show a positive interdependence between BTC and commodity price returns at both medium and low frequencies over the sample period. In contrast, the dependence is negative between BTC and EPU index at both medium and low frequencies. Furthermore, the co-movements between markets are more pronounced during crises. The results show that strategic commodities and EPU index have the ability to predict BTC price returns at both medium- and long-terms. The QQR method reveals that higher gold returns tend to predict higher/lower BTC returns when the market is in a bullish/bearish state. Moreover, lower gold returns tend to predict lower (higher) BTC returns when the market is in a bearish (bullish) state (positive (negative) relationship). The lower Brent returns tend to predict higher/lower BTC returns when the market is in a bullish/bearish state. High Brent quantiles tend to predict the lower BTC returns in its extremely bearish states. Finally, higher and lower EPU changes tend to predict lower and higher BTC returns when the market is in a bearish/bullish state (negative relationship). Originality/value There is generally a lack of understanding of the linkages between BTC, gold, oil and uncertainty index across multiple frequencies. This is, as far as the authors know, the first attempt to apply both the wavelet approach and a QQR method to examine the multiscale linkages among markets under study. The findings should encourage the relevant policymakers to consider these co-movements which vary over time and in duration when setting up regulations that deem to enhance the market efficiency.","[Hazgui, Samah] Univ Manouba, ESC, Manouba, Tunisia; [Hazgui, Samah; Sebai, Saber] Univ Tunis El Manar, IFGT, Tunis, Tunisia; [Sebai, Saber] Univ Manouba, ISCAE, Manouba, Tunisia; [Mensi, Walid] Univ Tunis El Manar, Dept Finance & Accounting, Tunis, Tunisia; [Mensi, Walid] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ & Finance, Muscat, Oman","Universite de la Manouba; Universite de Tunis-El-Manar; Universite de la Manouba; Universite de Tunis-El-Manar; Sultan Qaboos University","Mensi, W (corresponding author), Univ Tunis El Manar, Dept Finance & Accounting, Tunis, Tunisia.;Mensi, W (corresponding author), Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ & Finance, Muscat, Oman.","walidmensi1@gmail.com","","","","","","","129","3","3","4","9","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1086-7376","1755-6791","","STUD ECON FINANC","Stud.

Whilst we find an inverted asymmetry in the volatility of Bitcoin, its magnitude changes over time, and recently, it has become small. This asymmetric pattern of volatility also exists in higher frequency returns. Other measurements, such as kurtosis, skewness, average, serial correlation, and multifractal degree, also change over time. Thus, we argue that properties of the Bitcoin market are mostly time dependent. We examine efficiency-related measures: the Hurst exponent, multifractal degree, and kurtosis. We find that when these measures represent that the market is more efficient, the volatility asymmetry weakens. For the recent Bitcoin market, both efficiency-related measures and the volatility asymmetry prove that the market becomes more efficient.","[Takaishi, Tetsuya] Hiroshima Univ Econ, Hiroshima, Japan","Hiroshima University","Takaishi, T (corresponding author), Hiroshima Univ Econ, Hiroshima, Japan.","tt-taka@hue.ac.jp","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP18K01556]","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","This research was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Grand #JP18K01556;https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/index.html).","","79","5","5","0","5","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","FEB 1","2021","16","2","","","","","","","e0246209","10.1371/journal.pone.0246209","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246209","","","21","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","QF0FZ","33524019","Green Published, Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000616578400021","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This article models the novel economic structure implied by Bitcoin's innovative decentralized design, which allows the payment system to be reliably operated by unrelated parties called miners. We find that this decentralized design protects users from monopoly pricing. Competition among service providers within the platform and free entry imply no entity can profitably affect the level of fees paid by users. Instead, a market for transaction-processing determines the fees users pay to gain priority and avoid transaction-processing delays. The article (i) derives closed-form formulas of the fees and waiting times and studies their properties, (ii) compares pricing under the Bitcoin Payment System to that under a traditional payment system operated by a profit-maximizing firm, and (iii) suggests protocol design modifications to enhance the platform's efficiency.

Being WiFi supported, mobile devices nowadays are able to perform ad-hoc local communications in multi-hop manners, thus can potentially extend cryptocurrency service into areas without stable Internet connection. However, traditional blockchain architecture suffers from the intolerably high block propagation latency and communication cost which will be even trickier if adopted in wireless multi-hop networks (WMNs). This paper aims to reduce this latency and cost by leveraging node weights to distinguish the feedback speed of different nodes and constructing a low-length multicast tree to select a subset of nodes with higher feedback speed to participate in the block verification. Thus, block propagation is depicted by the minimum length multicast tree, intrinsically the Steiner Tree Problem. The primary challenge lies in that the WMNs only allow local communication and the distributed consensus protocol of the blockchain makes a predetermination of receiver nodes impossible. We design our algorithm via a toward source'' Steiner tree approach in favor of the distributed environment. Tree construction proceeds by progressively enlarging the searching areas until the accumulated weight of receiver nodes reaches a threshold. Our algorithm provably returns a tree length fairly close to that of the optimal Steiner tree with latency O(root nlog n) (where n represents the number of nodes in the network), the best so far. Furthermore, our algorithm is empirically validated to provide instructive insights for efficient block propagation with applications in Bitcoin network.","[Long, Teng] China Univ Geosci, Sch Informat Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Qu, Shan; Li, Qi; Wang, Xinbing] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Kang, Huquan; Fu, Luoyi] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Chenghu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","China University of Geosciences; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Fu, LY (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.","longteng@cugb.edu.cn; qushan@sjtu.edu.cn; liqilcn@sjtu.edu.cn; kinghiqian@sjtu.edu.cn; yiluofu@sjtu.edu.cn; xwang8@sjtu.edu.cn; zhouch@lreis.ac.cn","","","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFB2100302]; NSF China [42050105, 61960206002, 61822206, 62020106005, 61829201, 62002332]; Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader [18XD1401800]","National Key R&D Program of China; NSF China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader","This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2018YFB2100302, in part by NSF China under Grants 42050105, 61960206002, 61822206, 62020106005, 61829201, and 62002332, and in part by the Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader under Grant 18XD1401800.

This paper proposes the time-varying transition probability Markov-switching GARCH (TV-MSGARCH) models incorporated with BTC daily trading volume and daily Google searches singly and jointly as exogenous variables to model the volatility dynamics of BTC return series. Extensive comparisons are carried out to evaluate the modelling performances of the proposed model with the benchmark models such as GARCH, GJRGARCH, threshold GARCH, constant transition probability MSGARCH and MSGJRGARCH. Results reveal that the TV-MSGARCH models with skewed and fat-tailed distribution predominate other models for the in-sample model fitting based on Akaike information criterion and other benchmark criteria. Furthermore, it is found that the TV-MSGARCH model with BTC daily trading volume and student-t error distribution offers the best out-of-sample forecast evaluated based on the mean square error loss function using Hansen's model confidence set. Filardo's weighted transition probabilities are also computed and the results show the existence of time-varying effect on transition probabilities. Lastly, different levels of long and short positions of value-at-risk and the expected shortfall forecasts based on MSGARCH, MSGJRGARCH and TV-MSGARCH models are also examined.","[Tan, Chia-Yen; Koh, You-Beng; Ng, Kok-Haur] Univ Malaya, Fac Sci, Inst Math Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Ng, Kooi-Huat] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Lee Kong Chian Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Math & Actuarial Sci, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia","Universiti Malaya; Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR)","Ng, KH (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Sci, Inst Math Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.","sma170059@siswa.um.edu.my; kohyoubeng@um.edu.my; kokhaur@um.edu.my; khng@utar.edu.my","koh, you beng/J-8385-2012; NG, KOK HAUR/B-9228-2010","koh, you beng/0000-0002-8468-0757; NG, KOK HAUR/0000-0002-8763-7586; Ng, Kooi Huat/0000-0001-6426-9701","Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) [FRGS/1/2017/STG06/UM/02/9 (FP041-2017A)]","Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS)","Authors would like to thank the editor and anonymous referees for their valuable and constructive comments.

This study contributes to the related literature by investigating the endogenous interplay between investor activity on the virtual investment community and the market trading dynamics using a vector autoregressive framework to analyze an hourly dataset collected from the Bitcoin market. The main results suggest that the sentiment and the posting frequency of virtual investment community messages are largely driven by the past market outcomes, but they provide limited value-relevant information for future price prediction. It is also demonstrated that when investors express conflicting opinions, or when their discussions exhibit a lack of diversity, their incentive to trade decreases, resulting in low trading volume.

This paper fills this gap by: (1) defining metrics that quantify the impact of network latency on the mining network; (2) developing a tool, named miner entanglement (ME), to experimentally evaluate these metrics with a focus on the network latency of the top mining pools; and (3) quantifying the impact of the current network delays on Bitcoin's mining network. For example, we evaluated that Poolin, a Bitcoin mining pool, was able to gain between 0.5% and 1.9% of blocks in addition (i.e., from 36.27 BTC to 137.83 BTC) per week thanks to its low network latency. Moreover, as pools are rational in Bitcoin, we model the strategy a pool would follow to improve its network latency (e.g., by leveraging our ME tool) as a two party game. We show that a Bitcoin mining pool could improve its effective hash rate by up to 4.5%. For a multi-party game, we use a state-of-the-art Bitcoin mining simulator to study the situation where all pools attempt to improve their network latency and show that the largest mining pools would improve their revenue and reach a Nash equilibrium while the smaller mining pools would suffer from a decreased access to the network, and therefore a decreased revenue. These conclusions further incentivize the centralisation of the mining network in Bitcoin, and provide an empirical explanation for the observed tendency of pools to design and rely on low latency private networks.","[Cao, Tong] SnT Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Decouchant, Teremie] Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands; [Yu, Jiangshan] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Esteves-Verissimo, Paulo] RC3 KAUST, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","University of Luxembourg; Delft University of Technology; Monash University","Cao, T (corresponding author), SnT Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.","","Decouchant, Jeremie/AAH-4457-2021","Decouchant, Jeremie/0000-0001-9143-3984","Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg (FNR) [FNR/P14/8149128]","Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg (FNR)(Luxembourg National Research Fund)","This work is partially supported by the Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg (FNR) through PEARL grant FNR/P14/8149128.","","32","0","0","0","0","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","1060-9857","2575-8462","978-1-6654-3819-3","SYM REL DIST SYST","","","2021","","","","","","","109","119","","10.1109/SRDS53918.2021.00020","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SRDS53918.2021.00020","","","11","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS5YY","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000744463600011","View Full Record in Web of Science"

From 2014 to 2018, the Bitcoin network size has increased, while the percentage of synchronized nodes has decreased due to block propagation delay, which increases with the network size. However, in the last few months, the network synchronization has deteriorated despite a constant network size. The change in the synchronization pattern suggests that the network size is not the only factor in place, necessitating a root cause analysis of network synchronization. In this paper, we perform a root cause analysis to study four factors that affect network synchronization: the unreachable nodes, the addressing protocol, the information relaying protocol, and the network churn. Our study reveals that the unreachable nodes size is 24x the reachable network size. We also found that the network addressing protocol does not distinguish between reachable and unreachable nodes, leading to inefficiencies due to attempts to connect with unreachable nodes/addresses. We note that the outcome of this behavior is a low success rate of the outgoing connections, which reduces the average outdegree. Through measurements, we found malicious nodes that exploit this opportunity to flood the network with unreachable addresses. We also discovered that Bitcoin follows a round-robin relaying mechanism that adds a small delay in block propagation. Finally, we observe a high churn in the Bitcoin network where approximate to 8% nodes leave the network every day. In the last few months the churn among synchronized nodes has doubled, which is likely the most dominant factor in decreasing network synchronization. Consolidating our insights, we propose improvements in Bitcoin Core to increase network synchronization.","[Saad, Muhammad; Mohaisen, David] Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Chen, Songqing] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; George Mason University","Saad, M (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.","saad.ucf@knights.ucf.edu; sqchen@gmu.edu; mohaisen@ucf.edu","Mohaisen, David/GQP-2695-2022","","NRF [NRF-2016K1A1A2912757]; NSF [CNS-2007153]","NRF; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","M.

Existing approaches to protect privacy (e.g., mixcoin, shuffle, and blinded token) suffer from a number of limitations. For example, some approaches assume the existence of a trusted third party, rely on exchanges among various currencies, or broadcast sensitive details before mixing. Therefore, there is a real risk of privacy breach or losing tokens. Thus in this paper, we design a mixing scheme with one decentralized signature protocol, which does not rely on a third party or require a transaction fee. Specifically, our scheme uses a negotiation process to guarantee transaction details, which is monitored by the participants. Furthermore, the scheme includes a signature protocol based on the ElGamal signature protocol and secret sharing. The proposed scheme is then proven secure.","[Xiao, Ruiyang; Ren, Wei] China Univ Geosci, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Ruiyang] China Univ Geosci, Sch Math & Phys, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Ren, Wei] China Univ Geosci, Hubei Key Lab Intelligent Geoinformat Proc, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Ren, Wei] Guizhou Univ, Guizhou Prov Key Lab Publ Big Data, Guiyang 550000, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Tianqing] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Software, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Informat Syst & Cyber Secur, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA","China University of Geosciences; China University of Geosciences; China University of Geosciences; Guizhou University; University of Technology Sydney; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA)","Ren, W (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Ren, W (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Hubei Key Lab Intelligent Geoinformat Proc, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.","ruiyangxiaomath@cug.edu.cn; weirencs@cug.edu.cn; t.zhu@deakin.edu.au; raymond.choo@fulbrightmail.org","Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond/A-3634-2009","Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond/0000-0001-9208-5336","Major Scientific and Technological Special Project of Guizhou Province [20183001]; Open Funding of Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Big Data [2018BDKFJJ009, 2017BDKFJJ006]; National Science Foundation China [61502362]; Open Funding of Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory of Intelligent Geo-Information Processing [KLIGIP2016A05]","Major Scientific and Technological Special Project of Guizhou Province; Open Funding of Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Big Data; National Science Foundation China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Open Funding of Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory of Intelligent Geo-Information Processing","This research was financially supported by the Major Scientific and Technological Special Project of Guizhou Province (No. 20183001), the Open Funding of Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Big Data (No. 2018BDKFJJ009, No. 2017BDKFJJ006), the National Science Foundation China (No. 61502362), and the Open Funding of Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory of Intelligent Geo-Information Processing (No. KLIGIP2016A05).","","24","5","5","9","31","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA","1545-5971","1941-0018","","IEEE T DEPEND SECURE","IEEE Trans.

Where market matching uses an electronic limit order book (LOB), limit orders traders may make suboptimal price and trade decisions based on new but incomplete information arriving with market orders. This paper measures the information asymmetries in Bitcoin trading limit order books on the Kraken platform, and compares these to prior studies on equities LOB markets. In limit order book markets, traders have the option of waiting to supply liquidity through limit orders, or immediately demanding liquidity through market orders or aggressively priced limit orders. In my multivariate analysis, I control for volatility, trading volume, trading intensity and order imbalance to isolate the effect of trade informativeness on book liquidity. The current research offers the first empirical study of Glosten (1994) to yield a positive, and credibly large transaction cost parameter. Trade and LOB datasets in this study were several orders of magnitude larger than any of the prior studies. Given the poor small sample properties of GMM, it is likely that this substantial increase in size of datasets is essential for validating the model. The research strongly supports Glosten's seminal theoretical model of limit order book markets, showing that these are valid models of Bitcoin markets. This research empirically tested and confirmed trade informativeness as a prime driver of market liquidity in the Bitcoin market.","[Westland, J.

In Brazil, the regulator promotes reverse bid auctions where the winner agrees to begin production a number of years ahead under a long-term contract. If a wind farm project chooses to anticipate construction, it can sell its energy in the short-term market but becomes subject to electricity price volatility. In order to create incentives for early investment, we propose that wind farm investors can hedge electricity price risk by simultaneously investing in a cryptocurrency mining facility that uses electricity as input to produce newly minted Bitcoins. As electricity and Bitcoin prices are uncorrelated, the ability to switch between these outputs allows the wind farm to maximize revenues and minimize losses. We develop a numerical application under the real options approach to determine the financial impact of the investment in a Bitcoin facility for the wind energy producer that will allow it to optimally switch outputs depending on the relative future prices of electricity and Bitcoins. The short-term energy price and Bitcoin price/mining-difficulty ratio are modeled as distinct stochastic diffusion processes. The results indicate that the option to switch outputs significantly increases the generator's revenue while simultaneously decreasing the risk of anticipating the construction. These findings, which can also be applied to other renewable energy sources, may be of interest to both the energy generator as well as the system regulator as it creates an incentive for early investment in sustainable and renewable energy sources.","[Bastian-Pinto, Carlos L.; Araujo, Felipe V. de S.; Branda, Luiz E.; Gomes, Leonardo L.] Pontifical Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro PUC RJ, IAG Business Sch, Rua Marques S ao Vicente,225 Gavea, BR-22451900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil","","Bastian-Pinto, CL (corresponding author), Pontifical Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro PUC RJ, IAG Business Sch, Rua Marques S ao Vicente,225 Gavea, BR-22451900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.","carlos.bastian@iag.puc-rio.br; felvds@gmail.com; brandao@iag.puc-rio.br; leonardolima@iag.puc-rio.br","Bastian-Pinto, Carlos D L/D-5268-2012","Bastian-Pinto, Carlos D L/0000-0001-8074-7662; Van de Sande Araujo, Felipe/0000-0001-9259-3517","Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro FAPERJ [E-26/202.868/2018]; Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development -CNPq [303908/2018-1, 406198/2018-7]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES) [PROJ CAPES PRINT 1033427P]","Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro FAPERJ(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)); Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development -CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES))","The authors wish to thank the participants of the 23rd International Conference on Real Options in London, England, for their comments on a preliminary version of this paper.

As of March 2021, new nodes connecting to the Bitcoin blockchain already need to synchronize and validate more than 330 GB of data. Already now, this is an issue for resource-constrained thin clients who lack the required download, storage, or computing capacities to achieve this. In future, this issue will become even more relevant when blockchain technology is applied to new domains like the Internet of Things (IoT). We propose a new blockchain architecture that addresses this issue. Our proposal relies on incremental snapshot blocks that allow new and occasionally used clients to synchronize with the current state of the blockchain efficiently.

In this paper, we describe the proposed architecture in detail and evaluate its storage-saving potential using the Bitcoin blockchain.

However, criminals and terrorists quickly exploited Bitcoin's unique properties, namely its peer-to-peer nature and pseudo-anonymity, to facilitate extensive terrorist financing and money laundering schemes. Government reactions to safeguard national security interests have been extremely varied, ranging from outright bans to passive tolerance. This inconsistency stems from how to effectively classify Bitcoin. On one side are those who argue Bitcoin is a currency, and on the other are those who claim it is a type of asset. In the US alone, these discrepancies have led to a bureaucratic turf war between different regulatory bodies, namely the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Commodity Futures Trading Association, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Internal Revenue Service. This study seeks to move beyond the existing legal frameworks, arguing that Bitcoin should be classified as a technology and regulation should rest with private sector technology companies.","[Fletcher, Emily; Larkin, Charles] Johns Hopkins Univ, Kreiger Sch Arts & Sci, Baltimore, MD USA; [Larkin, Charles] Univ Bath, Inst Policy Res, Bath, Avon, England; [Larkin, Charles] Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Business Sch, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Corbet, Shaen] Dublin City Univ, DCU Business Sch, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Corbet, Shaen] Univ Waikato, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand","Johns Hopkins University; University of Bath; Trinity College Dublin; Dublin City University; University of Waikato","Corbet, S (corresponding author), Dublin City Univ, DCU Business Sch, Dublin 9, Ireland.;Corbet, S (corresponding author), Univ Waikato, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand.","shaen.corbet@dcu.ie","Corbet, Shaen/B-4869-2017; Larkin, Charles/C-5815-2017","Corbet, Shaen/0000-0001-7430-7417; Larkin, Charles/0000-0002-0352-2504","","","","","83","5","5","6","48","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0275-5319","1878-3384","","RES INT BUS FINANC","Res.

Specifically, we examine the effect of Dark Tetrad traits (Machiavellianism, subclinical narcissism, subclinical psychopathy, and subclinical sadism) on a person's crypto attitude and buying intention. The following mediators were examined as reasons for people buying crypto: (1) conspiracy beliefs (e.g., distrust of government), (2) positivity and (3) fear of missing out (FoMO). Importantly, we are not suggesting all crypto buyers exhibit Dark Tetrad traits. Based on a pre-registered survey of the main research question rather than hypotheses (N = 566), it was found that narcissism was positively associated with crypto attitude which was mediated by positivity. Machiavellianism was associated with buying intention which was mediated by conspiracy beliefs. Machiavellians were more distrustful of government which was associated with a greater desire to buy crypto. Psychopathy affected crypto judgments through FoMO and a negative effect on positivity. Sadism is associated with FoMO and a lack of positivity which affects crypto judgments.","[Martin, Brett A.

The authors divide the sample into two subperiods to capture the changing dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach The authors retrieve the novel fear sentiment data from Thomson Reuters MarketPsych Indices (TRMI). The authors denote the subperiods as pre- and post-COVID-19 considering January 13, 2020, when the first COVID-19 confirmed case was reported outside China. The authors use bivariate vector autoregressive models given below with lag-length k, to investigate the dynamics between BTC variables and fear sentiment. Findings BTC market measures have dissimilar dynamics before and after the Coronavirus outbreak. The results reveal that due to the excessive uncertainty led by the outbreak, an increase in fear sentiment negatively affects the BTC returns more persistently and significantly. For the post-COVID-19 period, an increase in fear also results in more fluctuations in transaction volume while its initial and cumulative effects are both negative. Due to extreme uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, investors may trade more aggressively in the initial phases of the shock. Practical implications The authors are convinced that the results in this paper have more far-reaching implications for other markets regulated by the states. BTC provides a natural benchmark to understand how fear sentiment drives and impacts the markets isolated from any interventions. Hence, the results show that in the absence of regulatory frameworks, market dynamics are likely to be more volatile and the fear sentiment has more persistent impacts. The authors also highlight the importance of using micro, asset-specific sentiment measures to capture market dynamics better. Originality/value BTC is not associated with any regulatory authority and is not produced by the governments and central banks. COVID-19 as a natural experiment provides an opportunity to explore the pure effects of market sentiment on BTC considering its decentralized and unregulated features. The paper has two main contributions. First, the authors use BTC-specific fear sentiment novel data set of TRMI instead of more general market sentiments used in the existing studies. Next, this is the first study to examine the association between fear and BTC before and after COVID-19.","[Polat, Ali Yavuz] Abdullah Gul Univ, Dept Econ, Kayseri, Turkey; [Aysan, Ahmet Faruk] Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Coll Islamic Studies, Doha, Qatar; [Tekin, Hasan] Karabuk Univ, Dept Finance & Banking, Karabuk, Turkey; [Tunali, Ahmet Semih] Middle East Tech Univ, Ankara, Turkey","Abdullah Gul University; Qatar Foundation (QF); Hamad Bin Khalifa University-Qatar; Karabuk University; Middle East Technical University","Aysan, AF (corresponding author), Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Coll Islamic Studies, Doha, Qatar.","ahmetfarukaysan@gmail.com","Aysan, Ahmet/ABD-9167-2021","Aysan, Ahmet/0000-0001-7363-0116; Tekin, Hasan/0000-0003-2855-215X","","","","","35","0","0","1","6","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1086-7376","1755-6791","","STUD ECON FINANC","Stud.

The benefits of incorporating these jumps flow over into option pricing, as well as adequately capture the volatility smile in option prices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to analyze the phenomenon of price jump risk and to interpret Bitcoin option valuation as exceptionally ambiguous .

This paper focuses on the role of the unprecedented market stress induced by the COVID-19 pandemic in the interrelations among the variables. Accordingly, this paper proposes a structural change (SC)-VAR-MGARCH model and finds the COVID-19 pandemic has initiated a significant regime change. Furthermore, the relationship between the variables in the pre-pandemic regime is notably unclear, whereas an increase in belief dispersion in the pandemic regime due to market stress reduces BTCF returns but raises trading volume and volatility evidently. The outcomes in the pandemic regime are remarkably consistent with the difference of opinions model, though existing evidence on the dynamic relations is ambiguous. Moreover, the outcomes support our hypothesis that, in addition to information flows, market stress causing traders' behavioral biases should be considered as one of the crucial factors of tremendous price variability.","[Park, Beum-Jo] Dankook Univ, Dept Econ, 126 Jukjeon Dong, Yongin 448701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea","Dankook University","Park, BJ (corresponding author), Dankook Univ, Dept Econ, 126 Jukjeon Dong, Yongin 448701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.","bjpark@dankook.ac.kr","","","","","","","43","3","3","2","8","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0275-5319","1878-3384","","RES INT BUS FINANC","Res.

While several studies have been devoted to analyzing the selfish miner behavior, the impact of selfish behavior on Bitcoin network performance has received little to no attention at all. In this work, we focus on that impact using a Markov chain that models selfish behavior both from the aspect of mining and form the aspect of block distribution time. We find that blocks mined by honest miners undergo longer distribution time compared to blocks mined by selfish miners. This delay results in intentional forking and the resulting network inconsistency provides more opportunity for selfish miners to gain unfair revenue.","[Motlagh, Saeideh G.; Misic, Jelena; Misic, Vojislav B.] Ryerson Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada","Toronto Metropolitan University","Motlagh, SG (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada.","","","","","","","","15","0","0","0","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1550-3607","","978-1-7281-7122-7","IEEE ICC","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500701","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500701","","","6","Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Telecommunications","BS4HX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000719386002130","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Third-party Bitcoin mixers use obfuscation techniques to protect participants from blockchain transaction analysis. In recent years, various centralized and decentralized Bitcoin mixing methods were proposed in academic literature (e.g., CoinJoin, CoinShuffle). Although these methods strive to create a threat-free environment for users to preserve their anonymity, public Bitcoin mixers continue to be associated with theft and poor implementation. This paper explores the public Bitcoin mixer ecosystem to identify if today's mixing services have adopted academia's proposed solutions. We perform real-world interactions with publicly available mixers to analyze both implementation and resistance to common threats in the mixing landscape. We present data from 21 publicly available mixing services on the deep web and clearnet. Our results highlight a clear gap between public and proposed Bitcoin mixers in both implementation and security. We find that the majority of key security features proposed by academia are not deployed in any public Bitcoin mixers that are trusted most by Bitcoin users. Today's mixing services focus on presenting users with a false sense of control to gain their trust rather than employing secure mixing techniques.","[Pakki, Jaswant; Shoshitaishvili, Yan; Wang, Ruoyu; Bao, Tiffany; Doupe, Adam] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA","Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe","Pakki, J (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.","jpakki1@asu.edu; yans@asu.edu; fishw@asu.edu; tbao@asu.edu; doupe@asu.edu","","","National Science Foundation (NSF) [2000792, 1651661, 1703644]","National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea)","We would like to express our gratitude to the anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback.

Furthermore, we investigate these effects at various short- and long-term horizons using a variational model decomposition (VMD) method. The empirical results show that there is strong negative dependence between gold and USD, but Bitcoin and gold are weakly and positively connected. Secondly, risk spillovers exist only between Bitcoin and gold and between gold and USD. The risk spillover effect between Bitcoin and gold are not stable, that is, if Bitcoin or gold faces the downward or upward risk, both the downward and upward risk of another asset have the chance to increase. The negative risk spillover between gold and USD is stable, especially in long-term horizons. Finally, the risk spillover between Bitcoin and gold as well as between gold and USD are asymmetric at downward and upward market environment.","[Yu, Jiang; Li, Xiafei] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Shang, Yue] Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Marxism, Kunming, Peoples R China","Southwest Jiaotong University; Yunnan University of Finance & Economics","Li, XF (corresponding author), Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China.","546602717@qq.com","","Li, Xiafei/0000-0002-9349-1800","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71671145, 71971191]; Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China [17YJA790015, 17XJA790002, 18YJC790132, 18XJA790002]; Science and Technology Innovation Team of Yunnan Provincial Universities [2019014]; Yunnan Fundamental Research Projects [202001AS070018]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Science and Technology Innovation Team of Yunnan Provincial Universities; Yunnan Fundamental Research Projects","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71671145 and 71971191), Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China (17YJA790015, 17XJA790002, 18YJC790132, and 18XJA790002), Science and Technology Innovation Team of Yunnan Provincial Universities (2019014), and Yunnan Fundamental Research Projects (202001AS070018).","","68","2","2","8","32","HINDAWI LTD","LONDON","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","1026-0226","1607-887X","","DISCRETE DYN NAT SOC","Discrete Dyn.

Bitcoin has been successfully handling traditional Sybil and eclipse attacks; however, a recent Erebus attack [57] shows that effectively eclipsing a Bitcoin node is possible when the attack is combined with a network-Sybil capability; i.e., a malicious transit network can create millions or more Sybil identities. Given the immediate availability and stealthiness of the Erebus attack, Bitcoin Core has quickly implemented a few simple protocol/parameter changes to mitigate it. Our large-scale evaluations of these quick patches and three similar carefully-designed protocol tweaks confirm that, unfortunately, no simple solution can effectively handle the attack. This paper focuses on a more fundamental solution called routing-aware peering (or RAP), a proven silver bullet in detecting and circumventing similar network adversaries in other P2P networks. However, we show that, contrary to our expectation, preventing the Erebus attacks with RAP is only wishful thinking. We discover that Erebus adversaries can exploit a tiny portion of route inference errors in any RAP implementations, which gives an asymmetric advantage to the network adversaries and renders all RAP approaches ineffective. To that end, we propose an integrated defense framework that composes the available simple protocol tweaks and RAP implementation. In particular, we show that a highly customizable defense profile is required for individual Bitcoin nodes because RAP's efficacy depends significantly on where a Bitcoin node is located on the Internet topology. We present an algorithm that outputs a custom optimal defense profile that prevents most of Erebus attacks from the top-100 large transit networks.","[Tran, Muoi; Shenoi, Akshaye] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Kang, Min Suk] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Daejeon, South Korea","National University of Singapore; Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST)","Kang, MS (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Daejeon, South Korea.","","","Tran, Muoi/0000-0002-6049-5688","","","","","57","2","2","1","2","USENIX ASSOC","BERKELEY","SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA","","","978-1-939133-24-3","","","","2021","","","","","","","1253","1270","","","","","","18","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS4QP","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000722006801022","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In particular, our most interesting finding is the unusual presence of significant negative first-order autocorrelation of returns calculated on medium-frequency timeframes, such as one, two and four hours, signaling the presence of systematic mean reversion. It is also found that larger price movements lead to stronger reversals, in percentage terms. We finally point out the potential exploitability of the phenomenon by implementing a basic algorithmic trading strategy and retroactively applying it to the data.

Cryptographic accumulators, such as Merkle trees, offer a viable solution to the problem. Full nodes create a Merkle tree from the UTXO set, while stateless nodes merely store the root of the Merkle tree. When provided with a proof, stateless nodes can verify that a transaction's inputs belong to the UTXO set. In this work, we present a systematic study of Merkle tree based accumulators, with a focus on factors that reduce the proof size. Based on the observation that UTXOs typically have a short lifetime, we propose that recent UTXOs be co-located in the tree. When proofs for different transactions are batched, such a design reduces the per-transaction proof size. We provide details of our implementation of this idea, describing certain optimizations that further reduce the proof size in practice. On Bitcoin data before August 2019, we show that our design achieves a 4.6x reduction in proof size vis-a-vis UTREEXO [10], which is a different Merkle-tree based system designed to support stateless nodes.","[Bailey, Bolton; Sankagiri, Suryanarayana] Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA","University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","Bailey, B (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.","boltonb2@illinois.edu","","","National Science Foundation under the Graduate Research Fellowship Program [DGE - 1746047, CCF 19-00636]","National Science Foundation under the Graduate Research Fellowship Program","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under the Graduate Research Fellowship Program with Grant No. DGE - 1746047 and under Grant No. CCF 19-00636.

Recently, deep neural networks with advanced techniques such as ensembles have led to studies that show successful performance in various fields. In this paper, an ensemble-enabled Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with various time interval models is proposed for predicting Bitcoin price. Although hour and minute data set are shown to provide moderate shifts, daily data has relatively a deterministic shift. As such, the ensemble-enabled LSTM network architecture learned the individual characteristics and impact on price predictions from each data set. Experimental results with real-world measurement data show that this learning architecture effectively forecasts prices, especially in risky time such as sudden price fall.","[Shin, MyungJae] Seoul Natl Univ Hosp, Seoul, South Korea; [Mohaisen, David] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Comp Sci, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Kim, Joongheon] Korea Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Joongheon] Korea Univ, Coll Engn, Artificial Intelligence Engn Res Ctr, Seoul, South Korea","Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University Hospital; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; Korea University; Korea University","Shin, M (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ Hosp, Seoul, South Korea.","mjshin.cau@gmail.com; mohaisen@ucf.edu; joongheon@korea.ac.kr","Mohaisen, Aziz/ABD-6425-2021; Mohaisen, David/GQP-2695-2022","","National Research Foundation of Korea [2019R1A2C4070663]","National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (2019R1A2C4070663); J.

Therefore, violating the blockchain safety requires strong adversaries that control a mining pool with =:.. -51% hash rate. In this paper, we show that the network synchrony does not hold in the real world Bitcoin network which can be exploited to lower the cost of various attacks that violate the blockchain safety and chain quality. Towards that,fi rst we construct the Bitcoin ideal functionality to formally specify its ideal execution model in a synchronous network. We then develop a large-scale data collection system through which we connect with more than 36K IP addresses of the Bitcoin nodes and identify 359 mining nodes. We contrast the ideal functionality against the real world measurements to expose the network anomalies that can be exploited to optimize the existing attacks. Particularly, we observe a non-uniform block propagation pattern among the mining nodes showing that the Bitcoin network is asynchronous in practice. To realize the threat of an asynchronous network, we present the HashSplit attack that allows an adversary to orchestrate concurrent mining on multiple branches of the blockchain to violate common prefix and chain quality properties. We also propose the attack countermeasures by tweaking Bitcoin Core to model the Bitcoin ideal functionality. Our measurements, theoretical modeling, proposed attack, and countermeasures open new directions in the security evaluation of Bitcoin and similar blockchain systems.","[Saad, Muhammad; Anwar, Afsah; Mohaisen, David] Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Ravi, Srivatsan] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA","State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; University of Southern California","Saad, M (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.","saad.ucf@knights.ucf.edu; afsahanwar@knights.ucf.edu; srivatsr@usc.edu; mohaisen@ucf.edu","Mohaisen, David/GQP-2695-2022","","NRF [2016K1A1A2912757]","NRF","This work is supported in part by NRF grant 2016K1A1A2912757.

By investigating carbon emission flows of Bitcoin blockchain operation in China with a simulation-based Bitcoin blockchain carbon emission model, we find that without any policy interventions, the annual energy consumption of the Bitcoin blockchain in China is expected to peak in 2024 at 296.59 Twh and generate 130.50 million metric tons of carbon emission correspondingly. Internationally, this emission output would exceed the total annualized greenhouse gas emission output of the Czech Republic and Qatar. Domestically, it ranks in the top 10 among 182 cities and 42 industrial sectors in China.

We use a direct survey-based measure that captures the investors' sentiment on Bitcoins. This direct measure of Bitcoin investor sentiment is obtained from the Sentix database. The results of the study found that the Bitcoin prices experience appreciation when investors are optimistic about Bitcoin. Bitcoin sentiment has significant power in predicting the Bitcoin prices after controlling for the relevant factors. There is also evidence that the sentiment of the dominant cryptocurrency, i.e., Bitcoin, influences the price of other cryptocurrencies. Further, we extend our analysis by investigating the impact of equity market sentiment on cryptocurrency returns. We proxy equity market sentiment using two measures viz: Baker-Wurgler sentiment Index and the VIX Index. When the equity market investors' sentiment is bearish, cryptocurrency prices rise, indicating that cryptocurrency can act as an alternative avenue for investment.

However short-term trades may entail high profits if traders open and close the correct positions. The high volatility of cryptocurrencies, and in particular of Bitcoin, is what made cryptocurrency trading so profitable in these last years. The main goal of this work is to compare several frameworks each other to predict the daily closing Bitcoin price, investigating those that provide the best performance, after a rigorous model selection by the so-called k-fold cross validation method. We evaluated the performance of one stage frameworks, based only on one machine learning technique, such as the Bayesian Neural Network, the Feed Forward and the Long Short Term Memory Neural Networks, and that of two stages frameworks formed by the neural networks just mentioned in cascade to Support Vector Regression. Results highlight higher performance of the two stages frameworks with respect to the correspondent one stage frameworks, but for the Bayesian Neural Network. The one stage framework based on Bayesian Neural Network has the highest performance and the order of magnitude of the mean absolute percentage error computed on the predicted price by this framework is in agreement with those reported in recent literature works.","[Cocco, Luisanna; Tonelli, Roberto; Marchesi, Michele] Univ Cagliari, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Cagliari, Italy","University of Cagliari","Cocco, L (corresponding author), Univ Cagliari, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Cagliari, Italy.","cocco@unica.it","","Marchesi, Michele/0000-0003-1540-8773","Sardegna Ricerche Public Body, POR Sardegna FESR 2014/2020 EU grants: SardCoin -SardCoin: tecnologie blockchain a supporto del turismo in Sardegna; Top-down Cluster Projects; EasyWallet; R&D Grants for RD Projects; Crypto-Trading-R&D Grants for RD Projects","Sardegna Ricerche Public Body, POR Sardegna FESR 2014/2020 EU grants: SardCoin -SardCoin: tecnologie blockchain a supporto del turismo in Sardegna; Top-down Cluster Projects; EasyWallet; R&D Grants for RD Projects; Crypto-Trading-R&D Grants for RD Projects","This research is supported by the research projects funded by the Sardegna Ricerche Public Body, POR Sardegna FESR 2014/2020 EU grants: SardCoin -SardCoin: tecnologie blockchain a supporto del turismo in Sardegna; Top-down Cluster Projects; EasyWallet; R&D Grants for R&D Projects; Crypto-Trading-R&D Grants for R&D Projects.

Despite Bitcoin presenting some very peculiar idiosyncrasies, like the absence of macroeconomic fundamentals or connections with underlying assets or benchmarks, an asymmetry between demand and supply and the presence of inefficiency in the form of strong arbitrage opportunity, all these elements seem to be marginal in the definition of the structural statistical properties of this virtual financial asset, which result to be analogous to general individual stocks or indices. In contrast, we find some clear differences, compared to fiat money exchange rates time series, in the values of the linear autocorrelation and, more surprisingly, in the presence of the leverage effect. We also explore the dynamics of correlations, monitoring the shifts in the evolution of the Bitcoin market. This analysis is able to distinguish between two different regimes: a stochastic process with weaker memory signatures and closer to Gaussianity between the Mt. Gox incident and the late 2015, and a dynamics with relevant correlations and strong deviations from Gaussianity before and after this interval.","[de Sousa Filho, F. N.

We first present a coin mixing-based E-voting system model, which can cut off the relationship between the voter's real identity and its Bitcoin address to achieve strong anonymity. Moreover, we devise a secret sharing-based E-voting protocol, which can prevent voting number from being leaked ahead and further realize strong robustness.

A primary reason is our potential weakness toward robustly quantifying unquantifiable risks or ambiguity in Bitcoin returns. This paper introduces a behavioral channel to argue that the degree of ambiguity aversion is a prominent source of abnormal returns from investment in Bitcoin markets.

Our theoretical and empirical contributions consist of a typology that highlights four distinct roles performed by individuals shaping cryptocurrency markets. We furthermore identify six micro-level market actions, and delineate a novel theoretical model and propositions outlining the pathways with which these actions impact market size, market offerings, as well as market functioning.

Broadcast in such a network is slow and brings inconsistencies, i.e., peers have different views of the system state. Due to the delayed block propagation and the competition of mining, forking, i.e., the blockchain temporarily diverges into two or more branches, occurs frequently, which wastes computation power and causes security issues. This paper proposes an autonomous and distributed topology optimization mechanism to reduce block propagation delay and hence reduce the occurrence of blockchain forks. In the proposed mechanism, a node can autonomously update his neighbor set using the information provided by his current neighbors, since each neighbor will recommend a peer from his own neighbor set, i.e., a neighbor's neighbor, to this node. Each recommendation is based on a peer's propagation ability, which is characterized as a criteria function obtained through a combination of empirical analysis and machine learning. We further propose some metrics to evaluate a Bitcoin network topology. Experiment results reflect the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism and also indicate the correlation between block propagation time and fork rate.","[Jiang, Suhan; Wu, Jie] Temple Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University","Jiang, SH (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.","suhan.jiang@temple.edu; jiewu@temple.edu","","","NSF [CNS 1824440, CNS 1828363, CNS 1757533, CNS 1629746, CNS 1651947, CNS 1564128]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was supported in part by NSF grants CNS 1824440, CNS 1828363, CNS 1757533, CNS 1629746, CNS 1651947, and CNS 1564128.","","24","1","1","1","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-1760-0","","","","2021","","","","","","","314","320","","10.1109/Blockchain53845.2021.00050","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain53845.2021.00050","","","7","","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","","BS9CN","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000779214600038","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Design/methodology/approach The joint regression analysis of value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) can effectively overcome the non-elicitability problem of ES to better measure the risks and volatility of financial markets. And because of the incomparable advantages of the long- and short-term memory (LSTM) model in processing non-linear time series, the paper embeds LSTM into the joint regression combined forecasting framework of VaR and ES, constructs a joint regression combined forecasting model based on LSTM for jointly measuring VaR and ES, i.e. the LSTM-joint-combined (LSTM-J-C) model, and uses it to investigate the risks of the Bitcoin market. Findings Empirical results show that the proposed LSTM-J-C model can improve forecasting performance of VaR and ES in the Bitcoin market more effectively compared with the historical simulation, the GARCH model and the joint regression combined forecasting model. Social implications The proposed LSTM-J-C model can provide theoretical support and practical guidance to cryptocurrency market investors, policy makers and regulatory agencies for measuring and controlling cryptocurrency market risks. Originality/value A novel risk measurement model, namely LSTM-J-C model, is proposed to jointly estimate VaR and ES of Bitcoin. On the other hand, the proposed LSTM-J-C model provides risk managers more accurate forecasts of volatility in the Bitcoin market.","[Lu, Xunfa; Liu, Cheng] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Res Ctr Risk Management & Emergency Decis Making, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Lai, Kin Keung] Univ Int Business & Econ, Shenzhen Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Cui, Hairong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China","Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of International Business & Economics; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology","Lu, XF (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Res Ctr Risk Management & Emergency Decis Making, Nanjing, Peoples R China.","xunfalu-c@my.cityu.edu.hk","Lai, Kin Keung/AEB-4278-2022","Liu, Cheng/0000-0002-9484-8234","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71701104]; MOE Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [17YJC790102]; Social Science Fund of Jiangsu Province [20GLB008]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); MOE Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; Social Science Fund of Jiangsu Province","The authors would like to thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for the constructive comments, which helped to improve the manuscript.

The high volatility of Bitcoin and the complex factors affecting them make the study of effective price forecasting methods of great practical importance to financial investors and researchers worldwide. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called MRC-LSTM, which combines a Multi-scale Residual Convolutional neural network (MRC) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to implement Bitcoin closing price prediction. Specifically, the Multi-scale residual module is based on one-dimensional convolution, which is not only capable of adaptive detecting features of different time scales in multivariate time series, but also enables the fusion of these features. LSTM has the ability to learn long-term dependencies in series, which is widely used in financial time series forecasting. By mixing these two methods, the model is able to obtain highly expressive features and efficiently learn trends and interactions of multivariate time series. In the study, the impact of external factors such as macroeconomic variables and investor attention on the Bitcoin price is considered in addition to the trading information of the Bitcoin market. We performed experiments to predict the daily closing price of Bitcoin (USD), and the experimental results show that MRC-LSTM significantly outperforms a variety of other network structures. Furthermore, we conduct additional experiments on two other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum and Litecoin, to further confirm the effectiveness of the MRC-LSTM in short-term forecasting for multivariate time series of cryptocurrencies.","[Guo, Qiutong; Lei, Shun; Ye, Qing; Fang, Zhiyang] Sichuan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Chengdu, Peoples R China","Sichuan University","Ye, Q (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Chengdu, Peoples R China.","","","","","","","","39","1","1","1","4","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2161-4393","","978-0-7381-3366-9","IEEE IJCNN","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9534453","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9534453","","","8","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BS4TO","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000722581709022","View Full Record in Web of Science"

On the contrary, the crude oil and stock market act as volatility receivers. In addition, roles of each major commodity in the volatility spillover system are found to be significantly correlated with their respective financial properties.

Such large-scale networks however exhibit a degree of complexity that demands model-based simulations as real-world experiments are often not possible. In this work, we methodically characterize blockchain networks by reference to the paradigmatic Bitcoin peer-to-peer network, explore the state-of-the-art protocols, and emphasize this key design space. To this end, we conducted a longitudinal measurement study on the Bitcoin network, from which we extract a comprehensive network model and implement it as part of the bns network simulation framework. We validate the model in comparison to real-world measurements as well as to results from related work. Moreover, we experimentally show how network utilization and miners' geographical location impact the block propagation characteristics.","[Rohrer, Elias; Tschorsch, Florian] Tech Univ Berlin, Distributed Secur Infrastruct, Berlin, Germany","Technical University of Berlin","Rohrer, E (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, Distributed Secur Infrastruct, Berlin, Germany.","elias.rohrer@tu-berlin.de; florian.tschorsch@tu-berlin.de","","","","","","","40","1","1","1","1","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","0742-1303","","978-0-7381-2476-6","C LOCAL COMPUT NETW","","","2021","","","","","","","9","16","","10.1109/LCN52139.2021.9524930","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LCN52139.2021.9524930","","","8","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BS7TO","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000766931400002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The number of LN nodes has been significantly increasing since 2018, and today there are more than twelve thousand nodes actively participating of so-called LN payment channels. The upcoming Taproot upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol would further boost the development and adoption of the LN. Taproot is the most significant upgrade to the Bitcoin network since the block size increase of 2017, and it will make LN transactions cheaper, more flexible, and more private. We focus on the characterization of the LN network topology, using network active measurements. By crawling the underlying P2P network supporting the Bitcoin LN over a span of 10-months, we unveil the LN in terms of size and location of its nodes as well as connectivity protocols, comparing it to the P2P IP network supporting the BTC blockchain. Among our findings, we show that IP addresses exposed by LN nodes correspond mainly to customer networks, even if most BTC nodes are actually deployed at major cloud providers, and that LN nodes significantly rely on anonymized networks and protocols such as Onion, with more than 40% of LN nodes connect through Tor.","[Casas, Pedro; Romiti, Matteo; Holzer, Peter; Haslhofer, Bernhard] AIT Austrian Inst Technol, Vienna, Austria; [Ben Mariem, Sami; Donnet, Benoit] Univ Liege, Liege, Belgium","Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT); University of Liege","Casas, P (corresponding author), AIT Austrian Inst Technol, Vienna, Austria.","","","","","","","","7","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2374-3239","","978-1-6654-3538-3","IEEE INT CONF CL NET","","","2021","","","","","","","87","90","","10.1109/CloudNet53349.2021.9657121","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CloudNet53349.2021.9657121","","","4","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT1XN","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000803945200013","View Full Record in Web of Science"

While Bitcoin has attracted a substantial investment volume, the system has not achieved the status of a viable alternative monetary system. However, the distributed ledger technology (DLT) underlying the payment system is being applied successfully by financial institutions and is likely to have important implications for the future of money and banking. In this paper we therefore focus on the most advanced distributed ledger application in the financial industry: R3 Corda. This paper is structured as follows. In the first section, we relate the debate about systems of money creation to the rise of Bitcoin. Next, the development of R3 Corda is discussed and the lessons learned for monetary reform.

The interdependence among different asset classes, the two leading stock markets in Southeast Asia (Singapore and Thailand), bitcoin and gold, is analyzed for diversification opportunities. Design/methodology/approach The vector autoregressive-Baba, Engle, Kraft, and Kroner-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model is used to capture the return and volatility spillover effects between different financial assets. The data cover the period from October 2013 to May 2021. The full period is divided into two sub-sample periods, the pre-pandemic period and the during-pandemic period, to examine whether the financial turbulence caused by COVID-19 affects the interconnectedness between the assets. Findings The stocks in Southeast Asia, bitcoin and gold become more interdependent during the pandemic. During turbulent times, the contagion effect is inevitable regardless of region and asset class. Furthermore, bitcoin does not provide protection for investors in Southeast Asia. The pricing mechanism and technology behind bitcoin are different from common stocks, yet the results indicate the co-movement of bitcoin and the Singaporean and Thai stocks during the crisis. Finally, risk-averse investors should ensure that gold constitutes a significant proportion of their portfolio, approximately 40%-55%. This strategy provides the most effective hedge against risk. Originality/value The mean return and volatility spillover is analyzed between bitcoin, gold and two preeminent stock markets in Southeast Asia. Most prior studies test the spillover effect between the same asset classes such as equities in different regions or different commodities, currencies and cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the time-series data are divided into two groups based on the structural break caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of this study offer practical implications for risk management and portfolio diversification. Diversification opportunities are becoming scarce as different financial assets witness increasing integration.","[Kakinuma, Yosuke] Chiang Mai Univ, CMU Business Sch, Dept Finance, Chiang Mai, Thailand","Chiang Mai University","Kakinuma, Y (corresponding author), Chiang Mai Univ, CMU Business Sch, Dept Finance, Chiang Mai, Thailand.","yuky07@gmail.com","","Kakinuma, Yosuke/0000-0001-9098-9067","","","","","115","1","1","2","10","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1558-7894","1559-2243","","J ASIA BUS STUD","J Asia Bus.

Both the in-sample and out-of-sample performance of the various models are compared by means of appropriate selection criteria and statistical tests. These suggest that, on the whole, the piecewise linear models are the best, but in terms of forecasting accuracy they are outperformed by a model that combines the top five to produce consensus forecasts.

One manifestation of this interest has been the explosion of newly created coins and tokens. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of this burgeoning industry. We consider both cryptocurrency coins and tokens. The paper examines the dynamics of coin and token creation, competition and destruction in the cryptocurrency industry. In order to conduct the analysis, we develop a methodology to identify peaks in prices and trade volume, as well as when coins and tokens are abandoned and subsequently resurrected. We also study trading activity. Our data spans more than 4 years: there are 1082 coins and 725 tokens in the data. While there are some similarities between coins and tokens regarding dynamics, there are some striking differences as well. Overall, we find that 44% of publicly-traded coins are abandoned, at least temporarily. 71% of abandoned coins are later resurrected, leaving 18% of coins to fail permanently. Tokens experience abandonment less frequently, with only 7% abandonment and 5% permanent token abandonment at the end of the data. Using linear regressions, we find that market variables such as the bitcoin price are not associated with the rate of introducing new coins, though they are positively associated with issuing new tokens. We find that for both coins and tokens, market variables are positively associated with resurrection. We then examine the effect that the bursting of the Bitcoin bubble in December 2017 had on the dynamics in the industry. Unlike the end of the 2013 bubble, some alternative cryptocurrencies continue to flourish after the bursting of this bubble.","[Gandal, Neil] Tel Aviv Univ, Berglas Sch Econ, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Hamrick, J.

This paper develops a two-step analytical framework to explore this question across time. First, it estimates dynamic optimal weights, calibrated when investing between the aggregate market and a respective sampled cryptocurrency. This is performed separately for 11 major cryptocurrencies using the dynamic conditional correlation approach of Engle. Second, using a fractional regression approach, it uncovers linkages between optimal weights in cryptocurrencies and sources of economic uncertainty. Overall, this paper makes the following important findings. First, optimal weights in cryptocurrencies all rose rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic. In all, bitcoin showed to be the leading cryptocurrency in terms of hedging effectiveness during this recent time period. Second, most cryptocurrencies exhibit zero or negative betas consistently across time, thus making them natural hedging instruments for investors seeking to reduce their portfolio's comovement with the market. Finally, cryptocurrencies serve as better hedges for economic uncertainties arising from equity and commodity markets. They are relatively less effective for uncertainties arising from risks in the banking industry and firm default risk. This paper contributes broadly to the asset pricing literature since our two-step approach herein can tractably be extended to other asset classes or other econometric measures of systematic risk.","[Koutmos, Dimitrios] Texas A&M Univ, Coll Business, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA; [King, Timothy] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Zopounidis, Constantin] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Prod Engn & Management, Khania, Greece; [Zopounidis, Constantin] Audencia Business Sch, Dept Finance, Nantes, France","Texas A&M University System; University of Kent; Technical University of Crete; Audencia","Koutmos, D (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Coll Business, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA.","dimitrios.koutmos@tamucc.edu","","Timothy, King/0000-0002-7326-2162","","","","","68","5","5","3","13","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0270-2592","1475-6803","","J FINANC RES","J.

The hidden regimes represent different market phases identified through distinct vectors of expected values and variance-covariance matrices of the log-returns, so that they also differ in terms of volatility. Maximum-likelihood estimation of the model parameters is carried out by the expectation-maximisation algorithm, and regimes are singularly predicted for every time occasion according to the maximum-a-posteriori rule. Results show three positive and three negative phases of the market. In the most recent period, an increasing tendency towards positive regimes is also predicted.

Despite the known cryptographic guarantees present in the blockchain, there exists significant evidence of inconsistencies and suspicious behavior in the chain. In this paper, we examine the prevalence and evolution of two types of anomalies occurring in coinbase transactions in blockchain mining, which we reported on in earlier research. We further develop our techniques for investigating the impact of these anomalies on the blockchain transaction network, by building networks induced by anomalous coinbase transactions at regular intervals and calculating a range of network measures, including degree correlation and assortativity, as well as inequality in terms of wealth and anomaly ratio using the Gini coefficient. We obtain time series of network measures calculated over the full transaction network and three sub-networks. Inspecting trends in these time series allows us to identify a period in time with particularly strange transaction behavior. We then perform a frequency analysis of this time period to reveal several blocks of highly anomalous transactions. Our technique represents a novel way of using network science to detect and investigate cryptographic anomalies.","[Oskarsdottir, Maria; Mallett, Jacky] Reykjavik Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Reykjavik, Iceland","Reykjavik University","Oskarsdottir, M; Mallett, J (corresponding author), Reykjavik Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Reykjavik, Iceland.","mariaoskars@ru.is; jacky@ru.is","","Mallett, Jacky/0000-0003-1370-996X","","","","","27","0","0","3","4","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","SEP 30","2021","16","9","","","","","","","e0258001","10.1371/journal.pone.0258001","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258001","","","17","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","YI5QV","34591921","gold, Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000743903000064","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Nevertheless, not all blockchain networks are the same, and choosing the right consensus algorithm is important for companies willing to invest in this technology. Companies eager to implement blockchain should understand the underlying architecture when selecting a particular network. Through an in-depth analysis, this paper aims to explore and compare from a technical perspective the three biggest permissionless blockchain networks by market capitalisation: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple. Our research shows that Bitcoin gains a competitive advantage as a widely adopted means of payment, Ethereum excels in adopting a robust and flexible smart contract functionality whilst Ripple is most suitable for cross-border payments due to its scalability and fast processing speed. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the networks and their consensus protocols, this paper is designed to set the ground for further studies on the emerging applications of blockchain in numerous sectors.","[Fernandez-Vazquez, Simon; Rosillo, Rafael; De La Fuente, David] Univ Oviedo, Business Management Dept, East Dept Bldg,1 Floor Campus Viesques S-N, Gijon 33204, Spain; [Meijueiro, Luis; Alonso Alvarez, Raul] CTIC Ctr Tecnol, Gijon, Spain","University of Oviedo","Fernandez-Vazquez, S (corresponding author), Univ Oviedo, Business Management Dept, East Dept Bldg,1 Floor Campus Viesques S-N, Gijon 33204, Spain.","fernandezvazquez.simon@gmail.com","Meijueiro, Luis/J-8134-2016","Meijueiro, Luis/0000-0002-6148-2774","Council of Gijon through the University Institute of Industrial Technology of Asturias [IUTA-20-GIJON-1-24]","Council of Gijon through the University Institute of Industrial Technology of Asturias","This work was partially supported by the Council of Gijon through the University Institute of Industrial Technology of Asturias (Ref.

We find that cryptocurrencies are strongly interrelated in returns and volatility but less in liquidity. We show that smaller and younger cryptocurrencies (such as Ripple's XRP or Litecoin) have started to affect the returns of Bitcoin since the beginning of the pandemic. Regarding liquidity, the results of the dynamic time warping algorithm also suggest that the position of Monero has increased.

In response to increasing interest in the time-varying nexus between green bonds and other assets, the current study empirically investigates the asymmetric relationship between green bonds and other conventional assets, including Bitcoin price, S&P 500, Clean Energy Index, GSCI Commodity Index, and CBOE volatility using recently proposed and novel methods of quantile on quantile regression and Granger causality in quantiles approaches. Our mainstream results demonstrate that other assets under study strengthen green bonds over sample period studied, and this impact is more pronounced in higher quantiles of respective variables. Moreover, our quantile causality test further confirms these results with robust finding across time scales and quantiles. To enhance clean energy and energy efficiency, policymakers should take into consideration limiting eligibility criteria in policies supporting green bonds or limiting refinancing using green bonds.

The recent proliferation of 'non-traditional' financial assets, such as cryptocurren-cies and stablecoins, is increasingly challenging the viability of these pragmatic financial asset definitions. Through the analysis of the technologies and functionalities underpin-ning non-traditional financial assets, legal scholarship has aimed to categorize novel assets within the existing framework of financial asset definitions. Although a solid understand-ing of e.g. distributed ledger applications and cryptography appears a prerequisite for future policy and legislative interventions, contemporary EU financial legislation is mostly indif-ferent to the technologies on which financial assets may be wired. Categorizations based on the purposes that non-traditional assets may serve (i.e. payment, utility, and investment) are more relevant to financial law, but suffer from subjectivity because they depend on the asset usage by the asset holder. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes a novel systematiza-tion of non-traditional assets that is based upon the conceptual substructure of the assets within the scope of EU financial legislation. More specifically, this paper submits that, irre-spective of underlying technologies and functionalities, all assets that are subject to major EU financial legislation have a conceptual common denominator: they entail the liability of an entity and, hence, have intrinsic value. The proposed categorization singles out a well-defined group of novel financial assets that is not subject to EU financial law (i.e. assets that only have extrinsic value). Different from functionality-and technology-based categoriza-tions, the suggested approach allows to eradicate some ambiguities that are present in the existing taxonomies. By exploring the conceptual common denominator of the financial assets that are subject to EU financial legislation, this paper aims to foster debate on the circular and exemplary character of financial asset definitions in EU financial legislation in general and the relation of these definitions to novel types of financial assets in particular.

With the rise of deep learning recently, various researches on forecasting the price of cryptocurrency using deep neural network have reported encouraging results in the cases of low volatility. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach which combines the advantages of non-stationary parametric models such as Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) with the nonlinear modelling potential of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The results show that our hybrid model has a similar predictive performance in terms of MSE, MAE and RMSE but higher metric scores in precision, accuracy and F1 score under optimal hyperparameters. This study reveals that the combination of parametric models like GARCH with deep neural network may come up with better results in cryptocurrency price forecasting especially in the case of highly volatile data or when short data sequences are available. Moreover, the proposed framework can be used also in other applications where high volatility and scarcity of data are the main characteristics.","[Gao, Zidi; He, Yiwen; Kuruoglu, Ercan Engin] Tsinghua Berkeley Shenzhen Inst, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA","","Kuruoglu, EE (corresponding author), Tsinghua Berkeley Shenzhen Inst, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA.","kuruoglu@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn","","","","","","","12","0","0","2","4","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2161-0363","","978-1-7281-6338-3","IEEE INT WORKS MACH","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/MLSP52302.2021.9596429","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MLSP52302.2021.9596429","","","6","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BS7MI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000764097000068","View Full Record in Web of Science"

They have been on the agenda of financial markets in recent years, and they are perceived as a new type of money. Considering the historical development of money, the emergence of cryptocurrencies is similar to the evolution of traditional currency. Therefore, great deficiency exists in the in the existing literature because money rules are not tested for cryptocurrencies, which have been referred to as the money of the future. Within the scope of this study, releases and the use of cryptocurrencies were comparatively discussed with other types of money, and Fisher's quantity theory model was tested for crypto coins. Using the market value and amount of Bitcoin, the time series analysis is performed with monthly frequency data covering a period from August 2010 to April 2021. As a result of the analysis, it is understood that a linear relationship prevails between the amount and value of Bitcoin. The main reason for this situation can be explained by cryptocurrency mining activities that use the blockchain method. the econometric analysis shows that the Covid-19 outbreak has strengthened the positive relationship between Bitcoin amount and market value. To understand the results of the analysis and fill the gap in the literature, issues such as money supply, emission and seigniorage income for cryptocurrencies are discussed and the operating processes for each are explained. This study contributes to the literature by showing that the Fisher Quantity Theory is not valid for cryptocurrencies.","[Firat, Seren] Istanbul Gelisim Univ, Meslek Yuksekokulu, Lojist Program, Istanbul, Turkey; [Dasdemir, Esat] Istanbul Gelisim Univ, Meslek Yuksekokulu, Dis Ticaret Program, Istanbul, Turkey","Istanbul Gelisim University; Istanbul Gelisim University","Firat, S (corresponding author), Istanbul Gelisim Univ, Meslek Yuksekokulu, Lojist Program, Istanbul, Turkey.","skaya@gelisim.edu.tr","DAŞDEMİR, Esat/AEL-5587-2022","","","","","","38","0","0","2","2","ISTANBUL UNIV","ISTANBUL","Rektorlugu, Beyazit, Fatih, ISTANBUL, 34452, TURKEY","2602-4152","2602-3954","","ISTANBUL J ECON","Istanbul Iktisat Dergisi-Istanbul J, Econ.","","2021","71","1","","","","","81","102","","10.26650/ISTJECON2021-879423","http://dx.doi.org/10.26650/ISTJECON2021-879423","","","22","Business, Finance; Economics","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Business & Economics","4F6WU","","Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000848651800005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Divergence and distance between distributions are measured by metric entropies, and are rigorously tested for statistical significance. We assess the stationarity and normality of assets, as well as the basic statistics of cryptocurrencies and traditional asset indices, before and after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. These assessments are not subjected to possible misspecifications of conditional time series models which are also examined for their own interests. We find that the NASDAQ daily return has the most similar density and co-dependence with Bitcoin daily return, generally, but after the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020, even S&P500 daily return distribution is statistically closely dependent on, and indifferent from Bitcoin daily return. All asset distances have declined by 75% or more after the COVID-19 outbreak. We also find that the highest similarity before the COVID-19 outbreak is between Bitcoin and Coal, Steel and Mining industries, and after the COVID-19 outbreak is between Bitcoin and Business Supplies, Utilities, Tobacco Products and Restaurants, Hotels, Motels industries, compared to several others.

The analysis is based on the computation of the singular value decomposition (SVD) entropy of a matrix formed by lagged vectors of price returns. The computed entropy is compared with a reference obtained from uncorrelated time series to decide whether the rows of the lagged matrix are uncorrelated. The procedure was implemented over a sliding window to assess the time variations of the entropy. The results show that the markets are informationally efficient most of time over different scales, except for some short periods that are linked to the 2016-2017 price-boom period and the 2020 Covid-19 economic downturn.

The prior modeling-based works about this attack only considered Bitcoin and assumed that there were at most two honest pools in a perfect network (no natural fork in such networks). However, a blockchain network is imperfect due to block propagation delay, which can lead to forking. Moreover, there may be more than two pools under attack. This paper aims for a quantitative analysis of an imperfect PoW blockchain network system under selfholding attack. We develop a novel stochastic model and derive formulas to evaluate the effect of selfholding attack on miner revenue, system security and system performance. Our work can be used to analyze the scenario where there are any number of pools suffering selfholding attack in both Ethereum and Bitcoin. The model in this paper can capture the behaviors of a more realistic and more general scenario, compared with the existing models. Moreover, our model and formulas can also be applied to evaluate a blockchain system, which uses a similar reward mechanism and is vulnerable to selfholding attack. Our work can help design a more secure blockchain incentive mechanism and an in-pool reward mechanism.","[Yang, Runkai; Chang, Xiaolin; Kang, Hongyue] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing Key Lab Secur & Privacy Intelligent Trans, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Misic, Jelena; Misic, Vojislav] Ryerson Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada","Beijing Jiaotong University; Toronto Metropolitan University","Chang, XL (corresponding author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing Key Lab Secur & Privacy Intelligent Trans, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.","18112049@bjtu.edu.cn; xlchang@bjtu.edu.cn; jmisic@scs.ryersvn.ca; vmisic@scs.ryerson.ca; 19112051@bjw.edu.cn","","Kang, Hongyue/0000-0002-9908-347X","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2019YJS034]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1836105]; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","The work of Runkai Yang, Xiaolin Chang and Hongyue Kang was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 2019YJS034 and by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant U1836105.

Using administrative data, we describe the investment behavior of individuals who invest in cryptocurrencies with structured retail products. We find that cryptocurrency investors are active traders who are prone to investment biases and hold risky portfolios. Cryptocurrency investors are more likely to invest in stocks with high media sentiment and more likely to employ heuristics from technical analysis. In line with attention effects and anticipatory utility, we find that the average cryptocurrency investor substantially increases account logins and trading activity after his or her first cryptocurrency purchase. Furthermore, cryptocurrency investors tend to tilt their portfolios toward even more risky securities after cryptocurrency adoption.

Indeed, with the development of machine learning and especially deep learning, forecasting Bitcoin is receiving a particular interest. Methods We implement and apply deep forward neural network (DFFNN) for the analysis and forecasting Bitcoin high-frequency price data. Importantly, we seek to investigate the effect of standard numerical training algorithms on the accuracy obtained by DFFNN; namely, the conjugate gradient with Powell-Beale restarts, the resilient algorithm, and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The DFFNN was applied to a big dataset composed of 65,535 samples. Results In terms of root mean of squared errors (RMSEs), the simulation results show that the DFFNN trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm outperforms DFFNN trained with Powell-Beale restarts algorithm and DFFNN trained with resilient algorithm. In addition, the resilient algorithm is fast which suggests that it could be promising in online training and trading. Conclusions The DFFNN trained with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is effective and easy to implement for Bitcoin high-frequency price data forecasting.","[Lahmiri, Salim] Concordia Univ, John Molson Sch Business, Dept Supply Chain & Business Technol Management, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bekiros, Stelios] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy; [Bekiros, Stelios] IPAG Business Sch, Dept Finance & Informat Syst, Paris, France","Concordia University - Canada; European University Institute; IPAG Business School","Bekiros, S (corresponding author), European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy.;Bekiros, S (corresponding author), IPAG Business Sch, Dept Finance & Informat Syst, Paris, France.","salim.lahmiri@concordia.ca; stelios.bekiros@eui.eu","Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/K-4041-2014","Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/0000-0002-9376-8726","","","","","9","4","4","9","34","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1866-9956","1866-9964","","COGN COMPUT","Cogn.

This article examines how the rise of bitcoin has particular geographies and trajectories of uneven development across the globe. The generation (or 'mining') of cryptocurrencies is computationally-intensive, requiring computer hardware, cool air and cheap energy. Adopting the case study of Quebec, Canada, we show how these variables interact to produce a relationship between digital currencies, economic imaginaries and space in the regions where cryptomining is clustered. We argue that these new geographies of cryptocurrency 'mining' leave residual marks on the regions where they are located but remain highly mobile - moving from location to location in search of the cheap energy that supports private accumulation. Adopting an illustrative case study of Quebec, Canada, we work to render visible the materiality of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin. Far from existing both nowhere and everywhere, the generation of bitcoin is foregrounded in local contexts and regional economic imaginaries with both spatial and social implications for the cities and towns where cryptomining takes place. We conclude with a call for further research into this emergent 'crypto-regionalism' and its consequences.","[Atkins, Ed] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Follis, Luca] Univ Lancaster, Law Sch, Lancaster, England; [Neimark, Benjamin David] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, England; [Thomas, Vanessa] Carleton Univ, Sch Informat Technol, Ottawa, ON, Canada","University of Bristol; Lancaster University; Lancaster University; Carleton University","Atkins, E (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.","ed.atkins@bristol.ac.uk; l.follis@lancaster.ac.uk; b.neimark@lancaster.ac.uk; vanessa.thomas3@carleton.ca","","Neimark, Benjamin/0000-0003-3229-0869; Follis, Luca/0000-0001-7195-669X","","","","","90","0","0","1","11","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0016-7185","1872-9398","","GEOFORUM","Geoforum","JUN","2021","122","","","","","","63","73","","10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.12.019","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.12.019","","APR 2021","11","Geography","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Geography","SB2MF","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000649833400007","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this study, we propose a novel ensemble portfolio optimization (NEPO) framework utilized for broad commodity assets, which integrates a hybrid variational mode decomposition-bidirectional long short-term memory deep learning model for future returns forecast and a reinforcement learning-based model for optimizing the asset weight allocation. Our empirical results indicate that the NEPO framework could effectively improve the prediction accuracy and trend prediction ability across various commodity assets from different sectors. In addition, it could effectively incorporate Bitcoins into the asset pool and achieve better financial performance compared to traditional asset allocation strategies, commodity funds, and indices.","[Li, Yuze; Jiang, Shangrong; Wang, Shouyang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Li, Yuze; Wei, Yunjie; Wang, Shouyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Zhongguancun East Rd 55, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Wei, Yunjie; Wang, Shouyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Forecasting Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Wei, YJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Zhongguancun East Rd 55, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.","weiyunjie@amss.ac.cn","","Jiang, Shangrong/0000-0002-2780-9075","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71801213, 71988101]; National Center for Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Sciences, CAS","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Center for Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Sciences, CAS(Chinese Academy of Sciences)","This research work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants No. 71801213 and No. 71988101, and the National Center for Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Sciences, CAS.","","58","2","2","7","38","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","2199-4730","","FINANC INNOV","Financ.

(The support vector regression (SVR) accepts input from a hybrid of technical indicators (TI) and reconstructed variational mode functions (rVMF). (The model is trained, validated, and tested in a period characterized by unprecedented economic turmoil due to the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing the evaluation of the model in the presence of the pandemic. (The constructed hybrid model outperforms the single SVR model that uses only TI and rVMF as features.

We employ a novel approach to choose the optimal combination for the power law exponent and the minimum value for the volatilities bending the power law. Our results indicate that Bitcoin volatility is well-behaved in a statistical sense with a finite theoretical variance. Surprisingly, the volatilities of stablecoins are statistically unstable and contemporaneously respond to Bitcoin volatility. Also, whereas the volatilities of stablecoins are not Granger-causal for Bitcoin volatility, lagged Bitcoin volatility exhibits Granger-causal effects on the volatilities of stablecoins.

We, first, propose a geopolitical risk composite indicator based on various sources of geopolitical risks. A Principal Component Analysis is conducted to group the information on these indicators. Second, a dynamic Markov-switching copula model (which accommodates a dynamic link between the developed geopolitical risk index and Bitcoin and gold price dynamics within low and high risk regimes) is used. We show that both Bitcoin and gold respond positively to the composite geopolitical risk indicator when risk is high. This underscores that both Bitcoin and gold have the ability to act as safe havens for assets whose valuations plummet during times of violent geopolitical conflicts.

Threshold ARCH is found to provide the best fit for estimations. Outcomes reveal that Bitcoin is strongly connected with EPU while Ethereum and Litecoin are not but are strongly linked with Bitcoin performance. Moreover, weak negative effects of the VIX on both cryptocurrencies are detected while oil exerts weak positive impacts on Ethereum.

Its use can be worrisome, e.g., to hide illegal communications. Researchers found that public blockchains can be an attractive place to hide communications; however, there is not much evidence of actual use in blockchains. Besides, previous work showed a lack of steganalysis methods for blockchains. In this context, we present a steganalysis approach for blockchains, evaluating it in Bitcoin and Ethereum, both popular cryptocurrencies. The main objective is to answer if one can find steganography in real case scenarios, focusing on LSB of addresses and nonces. Our sequential analysis included 253 GiB and 107 GiB of bitcoin and ethereum, respectively. We also analyzed up to 98 million bitcoin clusters. We found that bitcoin clusters could carry up to 360 KiB of hidden data if used for such a purpose. We have not found any concrete evidence of hidden data in the blockchains. The sequential analysis may not capture the perspective of the users of the blockchain network. In this case, we recommend clustering analysis, but it depends on the clustering method's accuracy. Steganalysis is an essential aspect of blockchain security.","[Giron, Alexandre Augusto] Fed Univ Technol Parana UTFPR, Dept Comp Sci, BR-85902490 Toledo, PR, Brazil; [Giron, Alexandre Augusto; Martina, Jean Everson; Custodio, Ricardo] Fed Univ Santa Catarina UFSC, Dept Informat & Stat, Grad Program Comp Sci, BR-88040370 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil","Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Parana","Giron, AA (corresponding author), Fed Univ Technol Parana UTFPR, Dept Comp Sci, BR-85902490 Toledo, PR, Brazil.;Giron, AA (corresponding author), Fed Univ Santa Catarina UFSC, Dept Informat & Stat, Grad Program Comp Sci, BR-88040370 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.","alexandregiron@utfpr.edu.br; jean.martina@ufsc.br; ricardo.custodio@ufsc.br","","Giron, Alexandre Augusto/0000-0001-7668-7505","Federal University of Technology (UTFPR)","Federal University of Technology (UTFPR)","The authors would like to thank the support of the Federal University of Technology (UTFPR).","","60","2","2","0","5","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1424-8220","","SENSORS-BASEL","Sensors","JUN","2021","21","12","","","","","","","4078","10.3390/s21124078","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21124078","","","22","Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation","SZ1TL","34199274","Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000666356500001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Indeed, the research conducted by Alexander and Dakos (2020) is the only one that has focused on the properties and differences of several data sources, underlining inconsistencies in the time series of prices. In our paper, we contribute to this strand of the literature by examining one of the main features of digital currencies: the cryptocurrency market never sleeps. Given that cryptocurrencies trade on a 24/7 basis, specialised crypto companies offer two kinds of prices (close and weighted prices) to proxy Bitcoin daily prices. However, scholars and practitioners have not considered this issue in their analyses. We show that these prices are statistically different, which affects the financial decisions of investors and the most relevant fields in the cryptocurrency market (efficiency, risk management and volatility forecasting). Therefore, our paper demonstrates that the data processing used by specialised crypto firms is a relevant issue that changes the underlying mechanism of Bitcoin data, affecting the results of investors and scholars.","[Vidal-Tomas, D.] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain","Universitat Jaume I","Vidal-Tomas, D (corresponding author), Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.","dvidal@uji.es","Vidal-Tomas, David/ABB-5697-2020","Vidal-Tomas, David/0000-0003-4519-0592","","","","","93","4","4","3","33","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1469-7688","1469-7696","","QUANT FINANC","Quant.

Moreover, emphasis is placed on interconnectedness and hedging and/or diversifying abilities, measurement of profit-making and risk, efficiency and herding behavior. This leads to fruitful results and sheds light on a broad spectrum of aspects. In-depth analysis is provided of the speculative character of digital currencies and the possibility of improvement of the risk-return trade-off in investors' portfolios. Overall, it is found that the inclusion of Bitcoin in portfolios with conventional assets could significantly improve the risk-return trade-off of investors' decisions. Results on whether Bitcoin resembles gold are split. The same is true about whether Bitcoins volatility presents larger reactions to positive or negative shocks.

Time series were first mapped into a complex network by the horizontal visibility algorithm in order to revel the structure of their temporal characters and dynamics. Then, the synchrony of the time series was investigated to determine the possibility that the cryptocurrencies under study co-bubble simultaneously. Findings reveal similar complex structures for the three virtual currencies in terms of number and internal composition of communities. To the aim of our analysis, such result proves that price and volume dynamics of the cryptocurrencies were characterized by cyclical patterns of similar wavelength and amplitude over the time period considered. Yet, the value of the slope parameter associated with the exponential distributions fitted to the data suggests a higher stability and predictability for Bitcoin and Litecoin than for Ethereum. The study of synchrony between the time series investigated displayed a different degree of synchronization between the three cryptocurrencies before and after a collapse event. These results could be of interest for investors who might prefer to switch from one cryptocurrency to another to exploit the potential opportunities of profit generated by the dynamics of price and volumes in the market of virtual currencies.","[Provenzano, Davide] Univ Palermo, Dept Econ Business & Stat SEAS, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Baggio, Rodolfo] Bocconi Univ, Econ & Tourism, Milan, Italy; [Baggio, Rodolfo] Bocconi Univ, Dondena Ctr Res Social Dynam & Publ Policy, Milan, Italy; [Baggio, Rodolfo] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Sch Core Engn Educ, Tomsk, Russia","University of Palermo; Bocconi University; Bocconi University; Tomsk Polytechnic University","Provenzano, D (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Econ Business & Stat SEAS, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.","davide.provenzano@unipa.it","Baggio, Rodolfo/D-5469-2014","Baggio, Rodolfo/0000-0001-9207-9665; PROVENZANO, Davide/0000-0003-0674-0387","Universita degli Studi di Palermo","Universita degli Studi di Palermo","Open access funding provided by Universita degli Studi di Palermo.

Previous work has been limited to analyzing the effect of uncertainty on Bitcoin. We depart from the previous literature by focusing on top 25 cryptocurrencies and find that the cryptocurrency market can serve as a strong hedge against geopolitical risks in most cases, but it could be considered a weak hedge and safe haven against economic policy uncertainty during a bull market. Notably, the cryptocurrency market reacts to uncertainty differently, depending on the type of uncertainty. Overall, our findings suggest that uncertainty is an essential determinant of cryptocurrency returns.","[Colon, Francisco; Kim, Chaehyun; Kim, Hana; Kim, Wonjoon] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Business & Technol Management, Daejeon, South Korea","Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST)","Kim, W (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Business & Technol Management, Daejeon, South Korea.","focc@kaist.ac.kr; chkimfin@kaist.ac.kr; tea112@snu.ac.kr; wonjoon.kim@kaist.edu","Kim, Chaehyun/GYQ-4968-2022","Kim, Chaehyun/0000-0002-7936-2893","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2018S1A3A2075175]","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2018S1A3A2075175) .","","17","37","37","8","38","ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE","SAN DIEGO","525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","1544-6123","1544-6131","","FINANC RES LETT","Financ.

Blockchains that may experience severe hash rate fluctuations need difficulty algorithms that quickly adapt the mining difficulty. However, without careful design, the system could be gamed by miners using coin-hopping strategies to manipulate the block difficulty for profit. Such miner behavior results in an unreliable system due to the unstable processing of transactions. We provide an empirical analysis of how Bitcoin Cash's difficulty algorithm design leads to cyclicality in block solve times as a consequence of a positive feedback loop. In response, we mathematically derive a difficulty algorithm using a negative exponential filter which prohibits the formation of positive feedback and exhibits additional desirable properties, such as history agnosticism. We compare the described algorithm to that of Bitcoin Cash in a simulated mining environment and verify that the former would eliminate the severe oscillations in transaction throughput.","[Ilie, Dragos I.; Werner, Sam M.; Stewart, Iain D.; Knottenbelt, William J.] Imperial Coll London, London, England","Imperial College London","Ilie, DI (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, London, England.","","","","","","","","21","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-3578-9","","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461086","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461086","","","5","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS1IM","","Green Submitted, Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000691552500034","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We examine the dependence structure of the US oil market and Bitcoin through Clayton copulas, normal copulas, and Gumbel copulas. Copulas help us to test the volatility of these dependence structures through left-tailed, right-tailed or normal distributions. We collected daily data from 5 February 2014 to 24 January 2019 on Bitcoin prices and oil prices. The data on bitcoin prices were extracted from coinmarketcap.com. The US oil prices were collected from the Federal Reserve Economic Data source. Maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation was applied to the dataset and showed that the US oil returns and Bitcoin are highly vulnerable to tail risks. The multiplier bootstrap-based goodness-of-fit test as well as Kendal plots also suggest left-tail dependence, and this adds to the robustness of the results. The stationary bootstrap test for the partial cross-quantilogram indicates which quantile in the left tail has a statistically significant relationship between Bitcoin and US oil returns. The study has crucial implications in terms of portfolio diversification using cryptocurrencies and oil-based hedging instruments.","[Huynh, Toan Luu Duc; Nasir, Muhammad Ali; Huynh, Ngoc Quang Anh] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Sch Banking, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Huynh, Toan Luu Duc] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Chair Behav Finance, Vallendar, Germany; [Huynh, Toan Luu Duc] IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France; [Ahmed, Rizwan] Univ Birmingham, Dept Finance, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Nasir, Muhammad Ali] Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield Business Sch, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England; [Shahbaz, Muhammad] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shahbaz, Muhammad] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Inst Business Res, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Shahbaz, Muhammad] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge, England","Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management; IPAG Business School; University of Birmingham; University of Huddersfield; Beijing Institute of Technology; Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; University of Cambridge","Nasir, MA (corresponding author), Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Sch Banking, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.;Nasir, MA (corresponding author), Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield Business Sch, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England.","toanhld@ueh.edu.vn; r.ahmed.6@bham.ac.uk; M.A.Nasir@hud.ac.uk; muhdshahbaz77@gmail.com; anhhnq@ueh.edu.vn","Nasir, Muhammad Ali/I-6252-2019","Nasir, Muhammad Ali/0000-0003-2779-5854; Huynh, Toan Luu Duc/0000-0002-1486-127X","University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam [2021-07-05-0447]","University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","This study is funded by the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam under the registered project 2021-07-05-0447.","","143","5","5","6","10","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0254-5330","1572-9338","","ANN OPER RES","Ann.

In spite of some scepticism in the financial area, cryptocurrencies are a relevant subject of academic research. Objectives: In this paper, several tools are adopted as an instrument that can help market agents and investors to more clearly assess the cryptocurrencies price dynamics and, thus, guide investment decisions more assertively while mitigating risks. Methods: We consider three methods, namely the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Auto-Regressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, and three indices given by the Hurst and Lyapunov exponents or the Fractal Dimension. This information allows assessing the behaviour of the time series, such as their persistence, randomness, predictability and chaoticity. Results: The results suggest that, except for the Bitcoin, the other cryptocurrencies exhibit the characteristic of mean reverting, showing a lower predictability when compared to the Bitcoin. The results for the Bitcoin also indicate a persistent behavior that is related to the long memory effect. Conclusions: The ARFIMA reveals better predictive performance than the ARIMA for all cryptocurrencies. Indeed, the obtained residual values for the ARFIMA are smaller for the auto and partial auto correlations functions, as well as for confidence intervals. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Unlike fiat currency, stablecoins are fully transparent-every transfer is recorded on a public blockchain. In this regard, they can serve as a valuable case study of the disruptive effect which transparent money flows could have on financial markets. We analyze how 1,587 stablecoin transfers of $1 million or more between April 2019 and March 2020 affected Bitcoin returns and trading volume. We find highly significant positive abnormal trading volume and significant abnormal returns in the hours around stablecoin transfers. The sender and receiver of each transfer are categorized as (1) unknown, (2) cryptocurrency exchange or (3) stablecoin treasury. The effects on trading volume and returns differ across the nine resulting subsamples, suggesting that market participants presume different transfer motives and varying degrees of information asymmetry for each sender-receiver combination. The findings illustrate the feedback effects between cryptocurrency markets and stablecoin usage and suggest that transparent money flows can increase market efficiency.","[Ante, Lennart; Fiedler, Ingo; Strehle, Elias] Blockchain Res Lab, Max Brauer Allee 46, D-22765 Hamburg, Germany; [Ante, Lennart; Fiedler, Ingo; Strehle, Elias] Blockchain Res Lab, Max Brauer Allee 46, D-22765 Hamburg, Germany; [Fiedler, Ingo] Concordia Univ, Fac Arts & Sci, 1455 Maisonneuve West, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada","Concordia University - Canada","Ante, L (corresponding author), Blockchain Res Lab, Max Brauer Allee 46, D-22765 Hamburg, Germany.;Ante, L (corresponding author), Blockchain Res Lab, Max Brauer Allee 46, D-22765 Hamburg, Germany.","ante@blockchainresearchlab.org","Fiedler, Ingo/AAX-7262-2021","Fiedler, Ingo/0000-0002-4638-8915; Strehle, Elias/0000-0002-4351-7865","","","","","61","9","9","6","19","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","0040-1625","1873-5509","","TECHNOL FORECAST SOC","Technol.

The vast majority of blockchain-based projects use the Proof-of-Work (POW) consensus algorithm, which paradoxically is well-known to consume a high level of electricity - how can a new solution promote green energy with transactions that are validated through a non-green process (POW protocol)? This perspective discusses this apparent contradiction by debating the extent to which the cryptographic validation of the POWbased blockchain technology (illustrated by Bitcoin here) can really fuelled with green electricity. I explain that the vast majority of the literature dealing with the ecological influence of Bitcoin mainly focus on the energetic dimension under-estimating the environmental impact. Integrating research about Life Cycle Assessments, I suggest here a conceptual framework rejecting the implicit assumption that renewable energy fuelled mining industry would make POW based operations greener. In the light of the recent ban of mining operations in China and Iran, the issue discussed in this article is timely for policymakers who need to promote the development of standards for mining operations related equipment in order to avoid potential negative environmental side effects.","[Schinckus, Christophe] Univ Fraser Valley, 33844 King Rd, Abbotsford, BC, Canada","University of Fraser Valley","Schinckus, C (corresponding author), Univ Fraser Valley, 33844 King Rd, Abbotsford, BC, Canada.","chris.schinckus@ufv.ca","","Schinckus, Christophe/0000-0002-0977-7428","","","","","59","8","8","6","15","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","1364-0321","1879-0690","","RENEW SUST ENERG REV","Renew.

The pseudonymity features of cryptocurrencies have attracted the attention of cybercriminals, who exploit them to carry out potentially untraceable scams. The wide range of cryptocurrency-based scams observed over the last ten years has fostered the study on their effects, and the development of techniques to counter them. The research in this field is hampered by various factors. First, there exist only a few public data sources about cryptocurrency scams, and they often contain incomplete or misclassified data. Further, there is no standard taxonomy of scams, which leads to ambiguous and incoherent interpretations of their nature. Indeed, the unavailability of reliable datasets makes it difficult to train effective automatic classifiers that can detect and analyse scams. In this paper, we perform an extensive review of the scientific literature on cryptocurrency scams, which we systematise according to a novel taxonomy. By collecting and homogenising data from different public sources, we build a uniform dataset of thousands of cryptocurrency scams. We build upon this dataset to implement a tool that automatically recognises scams and classifies them according to our taxonomy. We assess the effectiveness of our tool through standard performance metrics. We then analyse the results of the classification, providing key insights about the distribution of scam types, and the correlation between different types. Finally, we propose a set of guidelines that policymakers could follow to improve user protection against cryptocurrency scams.","[Bartoletti, Massimo; Lande, Stefano; Loddo, Andrea; Pompianu, Livio; Serusi, Sergio] Univ Cagliari, Dept Math & Comp Sci, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy","University of Cagliari","Bartoletti, M; Loddo, A; Pompianu, L (corresponding author), Univ Cagliari, Dept Math & Comp Sci, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy.","bart@unica.it; andrea.loddo@unica.it; livio.pompianu@unica.it","","LODDO, ANDREA/0000-0002-6571-3816; Pompianu, Livio/0000-0003-3745-4324; Bartoletti, Massimo/0000-0003-3796-9774","Convenzione Fondazione di Sardegna e Atenei Sardi Project [F74I19000900007]; P.O.R.

Using Wavelet coherence analysis and spillover index methodologies in bivariate and multivariate settings, this study examines the correlation of these assets for different investment horizons. The findings suggest that gold, oil and Bitcoin exhibited low coherency with each stock index across almost all considered investment horizons until the onset of the COVID-19. Conversely, with the outbreak of the pandemic, the return spillover is more intense across financial assets, and a significant pairwise return connectedness between each equity index and hedging asset is observed. Hence, gold, oil, and Bitcoin do not exhibit safe-haven characteristics. However, by decomposing the time-varying co-movements into different investment horizons, we find that total and pairwise connectedness among the assets are primarily driven by a higher-frequency band (up to 4 days). It indicates that investors have diversification opportunities with gold, oil, and Bitcoin at longer horizons. The results are robust over different types of equity investors (traditional, sustainable, and Islamic) and various investment horizons.","[Disli, Mustafa; Aysan, Ahmet F.] Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Qatar Fdn, Coll Islamic Studies, Islamic Finance & Econ Program, Ar Rayyan, Qatar; [Nagayev, Ruslan] Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim Univ, Dept Islamic Econ & Finance, Istanbul, Turkey; [Salim, Kinan] INCEIF, Sch Grad & Profess Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Rizkiah, Siti K.] WWF Malaysia, Sustainable Finance Div, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia","Qatar Foundation (QF); Hamad Bin Khalifa University-Qatar; Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim University; INCEIF; World Wildlife Fund","Aysan, AF (corresponding author), Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Qatar Fdn, Coll Islamic Studies, Islamic Finance & Econ Program, Ar Rayyan, Qatar.","mdisli@hbku.edu.qa; ruslan.nagayev@izu.edu.tr; kinan@inceif.org; srizkiah@wwf.org.my; aaysan@hbku.edu.qa","Aysan, Ahmet/ABD-9167-2021; Nagayev, Ruslan/E-9888-2019","Aysan, Ahmet/0000-0001-7363-0116; Nagayev, Ruslan/0000-0001-7102-9618","","","","","97","25","25","8","28","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0275-5319","1878-3384","","RES INT BUS FINANC","Res.

In the model, the prices of the cryptocurrencies are driven by stochastic adoption and velocity shocks as well as endogenous expectations of future prices. The model is estimated with data for prices, transaction volumes, and money supplies. A majority of price fluctuations in both currencies can be attributed to shocks in adoption, velocity shocks are much less important. The money demand sensitivity to expected price changes is estimated to be larger for Bitcoin than for Ethereum, and both have higher sensitivity than fiat currencies during episodes of hyperinflation.","[Jermann, Urban J.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Jermann, Urban J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research","Jermann, UJ (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.","jermann@wharton.upenn.edu","","","","","","","23","1","1","5","6","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0164-0704","1873-152X","","J MACROECON","J.

Therefore, the reaction of the cryptocurrency markets is important. News about epidemics affects investors' decisions. Panic index (PIndex) is an index created from news about the Covid 19 outbreak. In the study, it is used to measure the impact of decisions on the crypto money market. As cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC), Etherium (ETH), and Ripple (XRP), which have the highest transaction volume in the crypto money market, are included in the analysis. The relationship between Panic Index and the three major cryptocurrencies with the largest share in the cryptocurrency market was investigated by Ardl and Hatemi-J asymmetric causality test. Traditional causality tests acknowledge that the effects of positive and negative changes are the same. However, there may be asymmetric information and different investor behaviors in financial markets. In the study, Hatemi-J [1] Asymmetric Causality Test was conducted to examine the asymmetric relationship and symmetric relationship between Pindex and cryptocurrencies by separating them into positive and negative shocks. According to the results of the Hatemi-J causality analysis, positive shocks in the panic index are the cause of negative shocks for all cryptocurrencies. In other words, increases in the panic index are caused to fall the value of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple cryptocurrencies decrease. The results show that cryptocurrencies were not a safe haven for the investor during the Covid 19 period, as they acted similarly to other financial assets.","[Vurur, Necmiye Serap] Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Sch Appl Sci, Afyon, Turkey","Afyon Kocatepe University","Vurur, NS (corresponding author), Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Sch Appl Sci, Afyon, Turkey.","serapvurur@aku.edu.tr","","","","","","","34","1","2","0","2","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","2297-4687","","FRONT APPL MATH STAT","Front.

There is a historical narrative of fear surrounding cyber-crime. This has extended to cryptocurrencies (CCs), which are often viewed as a criminal tool. Aim. To carry out the first user study of CCs for illicit activity, from the perspective of underground and dark net forums. Method. We conducted a qualitative study, using a content analysismethod, of 16,405 underground and dark net forum posts selected from CrimeBB, a dataset of 100 million posts curated by the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre. Results. Firstly, finality of payments emerged as a major motivator for the use of CCs. Second, we propose an Operational Security Taxonomy for Illicit Internet Activity to show that CCs are only one part of several considerations that combine to form security in illicit internet transactions. Third, the dark net is hard to use and requires significant study, specialist equipment and advanced knowledge to achieve relative security. Conclusion. We argue that finality is the main advantage of CCs for this user group, not anonymity as widely thought. The taxonomy shows that banning CCs is unlikely to be effective. Finally, we contend that the dark net is a niche for criminal activity and fears over cybercrime cause the threat to be exaggerated.","[Butler, Simon] Royal Holloway Univ London, Informat Secur Grp, Egham, Surrey, England","University of London; Royal Holloway University London","Butler, S (corresponding author), Royal Holloway Univ London, Informat Secur Grp, Egham, Surrey, England.","Simon.Butler.2015@live.rhul.ac.uk","","","EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Cyber Security at Royal Holloway [EP/K035584/1]","EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Cyber Security at Royal Holloway(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","Simon Butler was supported as part of the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Cyber Security at Royal Holloway, University of London (EP/K035584/1).","","52","1","1","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-79318-0; 978-3-030-79317-3","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2021","12812","","","","","","135","153","","10.1007/978-3-030-79318-0_8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-79318-0_8","","","19","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; History & Philosophy Of Science; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Computer Science; History & Philosophy of Science; Social Sciences - Other Topics","BT0NZ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000790334400008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The results of the BEKK-GARCH model show evidence of a higher volatility spillover between cryptocurrencies and lower volatility spillover between cryptocurrencies and financial assets. The results of the DCC-GARCH model identify an important effect of the launch of Bitcoin futures. During the stability period, the overarching implications of the results are that there is a persistence of correlation between cryptocurrencies in high positive value and low dynamic conditional correlations between cryptocurrencies and financial assets. Also, we find that Bitcoin and gold are considered hedges for the US investors before the coronavirus crisis. Our results show that cryptocurrencies may offer diversification benefits for investors and are diversifiers during the stability period. At the beginning of 2020, we observe that the conditional correlation increased between cryptocurrencies, stock indexes, and oil which confirm the effect of the coronavirus contagion between them.

It is critical that a client is connected to at least one honest peer, as otherwise the client can be convinced to accept a maliciously forked view of the blockchain. In such an eclipse attack, the client is unable to reliably distinguish the canonical view of the blockchain from the view provided by the attacker. The consequences of this can be catastrophic if the client makes business decisions based on a distorted view of the blockchain transactions. In this paper, we investigate the design space and propose two approaches for Bitcoin clients to detect whether an eclipse attack against them is ongoing. Each approach chooses a different trade-off between average attack detection time and network load. The first scheme is based on the detection of suspicious block timestamps. The second scheme allows blockchain clients to utilize their natural connections to the Internet (i.e., standard Web activity) to gossip about their blockchain views with contacted servers and their other clients. Our proposals improve upon previously proposed eclipse attack countermeasures without introducing any dedicated infrastructure or changes to the Bitcoin protocol and network, and we discuss an implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the gossip-based schemes through rigorous analysis using original Internet traffic traces and real-world deployment. The results indicate that our protocol incurs a negligible overhead and detects eclipse attacks rapidly with high probability, and is well-suited for practical deployment.","[Alangot, Bithin; Reijsbergen, Daniel; Venugopalan, Sarad; Szalachowski, Pawel] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Dept ISTD, Singapore 487372, Singapore; [Yeo, Kiat Seng] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Dept EPD, Singapore 487372, Singapore","Singapore University of Technology & Design; Singapore University of Technology & Design","Alangot, B (corresponding author), Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Dept ISTD, Singapore 487372, Singapore.","bithin_alangot@sutd.edu.sg","VENUGOPALAN, Sarad/CAF-5029-2022; YEO, Kiat Seng/W-1493-2019; VENUGOPALAN, Sarad/CAG-0865-2022","YEO, Kiat Seng/0000-0002-4524-707X; Venugopalan, Sarad/0000-0001-9382-3652; Alangot, Bithin/0000-0002-6891-9174","A*STAR under its RIE2020 Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering (AME) Programmtic Programme [A19E3b0099]; Ministry of Education, Singapore, under its MOE AcRF Tier 2 grant [MOE2018-T2-1-111]","A*STAR under its RIE2020 Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering (AME) Programmtic Programme(Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR)); Ministry of Education, Singapore, under its MOE AcRF Tier 2 grant","This research is supported by A*STAR under its RIE2020 Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering (AME) Programmtic Programme (Award A19E3b0099) and by Ministry of Education, Singapore, under its MOE AcRF Tier 2 grant (MOE2018-T2-1-111).","","45","2","2","5","8","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","1932-4537","","","IEEE T NETW SERV MAN","IEEE Trans.

Generalized autoregressive schemes in the form of GARCH, EGARCH, TGARCH and GJR-GARCH are adopted in order to study volatility characteristics. Findings reveal that GARCH and GJR-GARCH specifications are most appropriate in the majority of cases. This reveals the existence of thresholds in the volatility of cannabis cryptocurrencies when examining their nexus with major digital currencies. This renders them riskier but also more attractive to speculators. Thereby, they abide by the overall character of such innovative forms of liquidity and investment. Overall, evidence indicates that Bitcoin presents medium to strong positive linkage with cannabis cryptocurrencies while Ripple is the most weakly connected to them. Thereby, none of the major digital currencies under scrutiny can serve as efficient hedger against cannabis cryptocurrencies.","[Kyriazis, Nikolaos A.] Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, 28th October 78 St, Volos 38333, Greece","University of Thessaly","Kyriazis, NA (corresponding author), Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, 28th October 78 St, Volos 38333, Greece.","knikolaos@uth.gr","","KYRIAZIS, NIKOLAOS/0000-0002-1260-4448","","","","","45","0","0","1","9","SPRINGER INT PUBL AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","1593-8883","1129-6569","","DECIS ECON FINANC","Decis.

Already today, virtual financial assets and tokens are a significant part of trading in global financial markets. The cryptocurrency market capitalization currently exceeds 600 billion U.S. dollars. However, there is a lot of discussion about cryptocurrency functions and the correlation between Bitcoin prices and the basic economic indices. Therefore, the purpose of the paper is to define the statistical substantiation of the influence of fundamental economic indicators on the market of virtual financial assets and the possibility of using cryptocurrency as the investment assets. This article is based on the theoretical principles and methods of econometric analysis; the system approach methods to define the main vehicles and trends of the international financial market. The study presents correlation analysis, regression models with paired and multiple variables. For these models, R-Studio instruments are the main tools of quality estimation and results interpretation. The article shows the results of the correlation analysis of Bitcoin's U.S. dollar price dynamics and changes in the main stock, monetary market indicators, cryptocurrencies market tendency, levels of the United States fundamental economic indicators for the period from 2014 to 2021. Traditional multifactorial regression models are used to determine the level and the impact of individual indicators of the world stock market at the U.S. dollar price of Bitcoin. A comparison of the level of volatility of key investment financial assets in the market of cryptocurrencies and stock markets is carried out. The authors determine the level of correlation dependence and make a regression model of the impact of fundamental economic indicators and stock market trends on the dynamics of U.S. dollar prices for key cryptocurrencies. The article presents conclusions on trends and problems of using cryptocurrencies as an investment asset, considering volatility and profitability. Implementation of the results allows to clarify the economic essence of cryptocurrencies as a specific financial vehicle, as well as improving the existing models of investment management, considering the statistical characteristics of the virtual financial assets. The main direction of further research is to build models of medium-term prediction of prices for the main cryptocurrencies as an investment asset in conditions of changes in global financial markets, which must consider the fundamental economic indicators of the world economy and trends on key stock and commodity markets.","[Baranovskyi, O.] Sci Work Banking Univ, Kiev, Ukraine; [Kuzheliev, M.] Univ State Fiscal Serv Ukraine, Educ & Res Inst Finance & Banking, Irpin, Ukraine; [Zherlitsyn, D.] Natl Univ Life & Environm Sci Ukraine, Econ Cybernet Dept, Kiev, Ukraine; [Serdyukov, K.] Univ Customs & Finance, Dept Int Econ Relat Reg Studies & Tourism, Dnipro, Ukraine; [Sokyrko, O.] Univ State Fiscal Serv Ukraine, Dept Finance, Irpin, Ukraine","University of the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine; National University of Life & Environmental Sciences of Ukraine; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; University of Customs & Finance; University of the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine","Baranovskyi, O (corresponding author), Sci Work Banking Univ, Kiev, Ukraine.","bai@ubs.gov.ua; m-kristo@ukr.net; dzherlitsyn@gmail.com; serdyukov@umsf.dp.ua; osokirko@gmail.com","Oleksandr, Baranovskyi Ivanovych/P-3508-2018; Kuzheliev, Mykhailo O/G-6791-2019; Zherlitsyn, Dmytro/M-6343-2017; NULES, NUBiP/ABC-8391-2021","Kuzheliev, Mykhailo O/0000-0002-7895-7879; Zherlitsyn, Dmytro/0000-0002-2331-8690; ","","","","","31","0","0","4","12","BANKING UNIV","LVIV","ST SICHEVYKH STREITSOV, 11, LVIV, UKRAINE","2306-4994","2310-8770","","FINANC CREDIT ACT","Financ.

In addition, we examine the effects of several financial, economic and cryptocurrency specific predictors on the cryptocurrency return series. Our results indicate that the non-homogeneous hidden Markov (NHHM) model with four states has the best one-step-ahead forecasting performance among all competing models for all three series. The dominance of the predictive densities over the single regime random walk model relies on the fact that the states capture alternating periods with distinct return characteristics. In particular, the four state NHHM model distinguishes bull, bear and calm regimes for the Bitcoin series, and periods with different profit and risk magnitudes for the Ether and Ripple series. Also, conditionally on the hidden states, it identifies predictors with different linear and non-linear effects on the cryptocurrency returns. These empirical findings provide important benefits for portfolio management and policy implementation.","[Koki, Constandina] Athens Univ Econ & Business, 76 Patission Str, GR-10434 Athens, Greece; [Koki, Constandina] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Leonardos, Stefanos; Piliouras, Georgios] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, 8 Somapah Rd, Singapore 487372, Singapore","Athens University of Economics & Business; University of Warwick; Singapore University of Technology & Design","Koki, C (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Math Inst, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.","Constandina.Koki@warwick.ac.uk","Koki, Constandina/AAA-7137-2021","Koki, Constandina/0000-0002-3236-8876; Leonardos, Stefanos/0000-0002-1498-1490","NRF [NRFNRFF2018-07]; National Research Foundation, Singapore under its AI Singapore Program [AISG2-RP-2020-016]; AME Programmatic Fund from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) [A20H6b0151]; Ethereum Foundation; ALIAS grant [NRF2019-NRF-ANR095];  [PIE-SGP-AI-2018-01]","NRF; National Research Foundation, Singapore under its AI Singapore Program; AME Programmatic Fund from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)(Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR)); Ethereum Foundation; ALIAS grant; ","This research is supported in part by NRF 2018 Fellowship NRFNRFF2018-07, the National Research Foundation, Singapore under its AI Singapore Program (AISG Award No: AISG2-RP-2020-016) , NRF2019-NRF-ANR095 ALIAS grant, grant PIE-SGP-AI-2018-01, AME Programmatic Fund (Grant No. A20H6b0151) from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and the Ethereum Foundation.","","81","2","2","1","11","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0275-5319","1878-3384","","RES INT BUS FINANC","Res.

This article has emphasized the ways, which terrorists appraise for being a reliable fundraising means and their adoption. Methodology. For the purposes of the study, the methods of scientific abstraction, synthesis, observation, generalization, as well as the method of induction of literature and legal documents were used to determine the features of bitcoin, promoting and preventing its use for terrorism financing. Results. The development of the Internet and electronic devices has radically changed all spheres of human life, including criminal activity. Digitalization has led to the improvement of ordinary crimes and the emergence of new types of crime, which, in principle, cannot exist without special digital electronic devices. Among the first implementers of new technologies were terrorists, who took advantage of digitalization to increase profitability. Thus, terrorists have now significantly increased their attention to cryptocurrency as a digital means of payment, namely Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a number of features that have attracted the attention of criminals as a way to evade responsibility for a crime. In particular, decentralization avoids the need for confirmation by a central authority, and pseudo-anonymity provides a certain level of anonymity. In addition, terrorists are aware that Bitcoin's confidentiality is extremely fragile and needs to be enhanced. The paper analyzes several ways to enhance anonymity, such as software that anonymizes traffic and prevents IP identification, peer-to-peer mixers, centralized mixing services (tumbler), and other approaches. It is worth emphasizing that for the fight against crime, the main issue is the de-anonymization of the Bitcoin owner/user, which allows the identification of the criminal. Currently, law enforcement agencies use direct and indirect de-anonymization, proliferation analysis, quantitative analysis, time analysis, and transactional network analysis, among others, to achieve the above goal, which are discussed in detail in this article. In addition, agencies around the world investigated and uncovered terrorist groups and their financial facilitators. Specifically, on August 13, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Public Affairs announced the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the context of terrorism in history. To investigate the agenda, the legal documents of those investigations that contain information about the terrorist fund-raising mechanism were examined and analyzed. The legal documents revealed that these investigations used the aforementioned de-anonymization approaches.","[Dyntu, Valeriia; Dykyj, Oleg] Natl Univ Odessa Law Acad, Odessa, Ukraine","Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; National University Odesa Law Academy","Dyntu, V (corresponding author), Natl Univ Odessa Law Acad, Odessa, Ukraine.","dyntuvaleriia@gmail.com; olegdykyj@gmail.com","Dyntu, Valeriia/AAO-3927-2020; Dykyj, Oleg/G-4515-2017","Dykyj, Oleg/0000-0001-9659-9350","","","","","17","0","0","4","10","BALTIC JOURNAL ECONOMIC STUDIES","RIGA","VALDEKU IELA 62-156, RIGA, LV-1058, LATVIA","2256-0742","2256-0963","","BALT J ECON STUD","Balt.

It does this entire task with a mere shared chain of transaction history utilizing blocks of 5-tuples (transaction ID, transaction fee, transaction size, sender(s) private key(s) and amount(s), recipient(s) public key(s) and amount(s)) that get added to the distributed ledger across all nodes in the peer-to-peer network around once every ten minutes. With Bitcoin's market capitalization at nearly a billion dollars, and many rising competitors taking advantage of Blockchain for financial transactions, it is not hard to see that this new way to transcribe digital information is sweeping the financial world at a blistering rate. For reasons explained further in this paper, we will explore why Blockchain financial ledgers tremendously increase security, transparency and privacy in comparison to traditional database financial ledgers.","[Nissan, Fady; Hamade, Jacob; Xiao, Jimmy; Ragle, Jonah; Price, Joshua; Fares, Julien; Mahmoud, Mohammed] Oakland Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Rochester, MI 48063 USA","Oakland University","Nissan, F (corresponding author), Oakland Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Rochester, MI 48063 USA.","fnissan@oakland.edu; jacobhamade@oakland.edu; jxiao@oakland.edu; jonahragle@oakland.edu; joshuaprice@oakland.edu; julienfares@oakland.edu; mahmoud2@oakland.edu","","","","","","","29","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-5841-2","","","","2021","","","","","","","625","632","","10.1109/CSCI54926.2021.00166","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CSCI54926.2021.00166","","","8","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT4NL","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000832229300109","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The blocks added also have a significant network delay owing to their large size. Large delay combined with randomness causes forks that are responsible for many security problems. One can reduce fork occurrences by designing a system with large block intervals and size but this design compromises performance aspects such as confirmation time guarantees. The trade-off between security and performance in PoW blockchain is a well discussed topic in the literature. In this paper, we aim to reduce the conflict between security and performance through our novel concept of Links. Links are small, fast and frequent structures that can be incorporated on any new or existing PoW blockchains. Links help reduce the confirmation time of its underlying blockchain while preserving its consistency security guarantees. Our novel lower-bound growth rate for PoW systems with links in the presence of a general adversary in a partially synchronous network, shows that links provide a more steady chain growth rate than classic PoW systems without links. On a well-established, secure system like Bitcoin, we use the derived growth rate to show that when links are incorporated to Bitcoin, they help reduce its confirmation time from 60 minutes by half to 30 minutes, while retaining the consistency threshold guarantees of the original Bitcoin system. We provide a proof of concept emulation of links in a Bitcoin test bed consisting of 210 nodes having real world latencies between them. We benchmark a system with links against Bitcoin to show links cause negligible network overheads and no compromises on security in terms of orphaned weight due to forks. Our theoretical analyses and experiments can easily be extended to other Nakamoto style PoW systems.","[Seshadri, Ovia; Kumar, Aditya] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Delhi, India; [Ribeiro, Vinay J.] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India","Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay","Seshadri, O (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Delhi, India.","ovia.seshadri@cse.iitd.ac.in; vinayr@iitb.ac.in; aditya.kumar@alumni.iitd.ac.in","","","Visvesvaraya Scheme by Meity, GOI","Visvesvaraya Scheme by Meity, GOI","This work was supported by the Visvesvaraya Scheme by Meity, GOI.

Using one-minute data on Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple against the US dollar, we implement the wavelet Hidden Markov Tree model. This model allows us to estimate the transition probability of high or low volatility at one time scale (horizon) propagating to high or low volatility at the next time scale. We find that when moving from long to short horizons, volatility cascades tend to be symmetric: low volatility at long horizons is likely to be followed by low volatility at short horizons, and high volatility is likely to be followed by high volatility. In contrast, when moving from short to long horizons, volatility cascades are strongly asymmetric: high volatility at short horizons is now likely to be followed by low volatility at long horizons. These results are robust across time periods and cryptocurrencies.","[Gradojevic, Nikola; Tsiakas, Ilias] Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Gradojevic, Nikola] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Novi Sad, Serbia","University of Guelph; University of Novi Sad","Gradojevic, N (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Lang Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ & Finance, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.","ngradoje@uoguelph.ca; itsiakas@uoguelph.ca","","","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [430418]","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC))","The authors are grateful for useful comments to Rossen Valkanov (Editor) , two anonymous referees, and Luka Vulicevic for excellent research assistance.

A multivariate VARMA-AGARCH model was used to model the transmission mechanism of mean return, return spillovers and volatility spillovers between these market pairs. Significant return spillovers and volatility spillovers were observed across these market pairs. Volatility spillovers in some markets were bi-directional and in other markets, uni-directional. We thus conclude that at the peaks and troughs of a stock market, investors migrate between these market pairs to maximize returns and reduce exposure to risk, resulting in return and volatility spillovers between the market pairs.

Sophisticated methodologies for accurate prediction of cryptocurrency are highly desired. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are good approximators, however their accuracy is greatly subjective to optimal network structure and learning method. This article designs optimal ANNs for efficient cryptocurrency prediction using quasi opposition based Rao algorithms, i.e. QORA-ANN. The model explores a set of potential ANNs in the search space and lands at an optimal network through the evolving process. Historical data from four emerging cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Ripple are used to evaluate the QORA-ANN. The prediction ability of the proposed approach is compared with few similar methods such as ANN trained with genetic algorithm, differential evolution and particle swarm optimization (i.e. ANN-GA, ANN-DE, ANN-PSO), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). From exhaustive simulation studies and comparative result analysis it is found that the QORA-ANN method performed better than others and hence can be suggested as an efficient tool for cryptocurrencies prediction.","[Dash, Ch Sanjeev Kumar] Silicon Inst Technol, Comp Sci & Engn, Silicon Hills, Bhubaneswar 751024, Odisha, India; [Behera, Ajit Kumar] Silicon Inst Technol, Dept MCA, Silicon Hills, Bhubaneswar 751024, Odisha, India; [Nayak, Sarat Chandra] CMR Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Hyderabad 501401, India; [Dehuri, Satchidananda] Fakir Mohan Univ, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Balasore 756019, Odisha, India","Silicon Institute of Technology; Silicon Institute of Technology; Fakir Mohan University","Dash, CSK (corresponding author), Silicon Inst Technol, Comp Sci & Engn, Silicon Hills, Bhubaneswar 751024, Odisha, India.","sanjeev_dash@yahoo.com; ajit_behera@hotmail.com; saratnayak234@gmail.com; satchi.lapa@gmail.com","Dehuri, Satchidananda/AFQ-1029-2022","Dehuri, Satchidananda/0000-0003-1435-4531","","","","","19","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-8876-8","","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/I2CT51068.2021.9417870","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/I2CT51068.2021.9417870","","","5","Engineering, Multidisciplinary","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering","BR9PH","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000679383900018","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate which one of the cryptocurrency markets contributes the most to the common volatility component inherent in the market. Design/methodology/approach The paper extracts each of the cryptocurrency's markets' latent volatility using a stochastic volatility model and, subsequently, models their dynamics in a fractionally cointegrated vector autoregressive model. The authors use the refinement of Lien and Shrestha (2009, J. Futures Mark) to come up with unique Hasbrouck (1995, J. Finance) information shares. Findings The authors' findings indicate that Bitfinex is the leading market for Bitcoin and Ripple, while Bitstamp dominates for Ethereum and Litecoin. Based on the dominant market for each cryptocurrency, the authors find that the volatility of Bitcoin explains most of the volatility among the different cryptocurrencies. Research limitations/implications The authors' findings are limited by the availability of the cryptocurrency data. Apart from Bitcoin, the data series for the other cryptocurrencies are not long enough to ensure the precision of the authors' estimates. Originality/value To date, only price discovery in cryptocurrencies has been studied and identified. This paper extends the current literature into the realm of volatility discovery. In addition, the authors propose a discrete version for the evolution of a markets fundamental volatility, extending the work of Dias et al.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are two prevalent Blockchain platforms, where the participants are globally connected in a peer-to-peer manner and anonymously perform trade electronically. The vast number of decentralized transactions and the pseudo-anonymity of participants open the door for scams, cyber frauds, hacks, money laundering and fraudulent transactions. It is challenging to detect such fraudulent activities using traditional auditing techniques, since they need more processing power, time and memory for complex queries to join combinations of tables. This paper proposes several algorithms to extract the transaction-related features from the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks and to represent the features as graphs. Moreover, the paper discusses how visualisation of graphs can reflect the anomalies and patterns of fraudulent activities.","[Tharani, Jeyakumar Samantha; Hou, Zhe; Muthukkumarasamy, Vallipuram] Griffith Univ, Sch Informat & Commun Technol, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Charles, Eugene Yougarajah Andrew] Univ Jaffna, Dept Comp Sci, Jaffna, Sri Lanka; [Palaniswami, Marimuthu] Univ Melbourne, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Griffith University; University Jaffna; University of Melbourne","Tharani, JS (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Informat & Commun Technol, Nathan, Qld, Australia.","jeyakumar.samanthatharani@griffithuni.edu.au","","Hou, Zhe/0000-0001-7164-0580","","","","","12","0","0","8","11","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","0742-1303","","978-0-7381-2476-6","C LOCAL COMPUT NETW","","","2021","","","","","","","427","430","","10.1109/LCN52139.2021.9524878","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LCN52139.2021.9524878","","","4","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BS7TO","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000766931400067","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Furthermore, the negative shocks/news have more impact on the volatilities than positive shocks/news in most of the cases, except the stock index of China and Bitcoin. Most of the correlation pairs exhibit higher correlation during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-COVID-19, except Hong Kong-The US and Malaysia-Indonesia. Moreover, the correlation between Asian stock indexes during the COVID-19 pandemic is statistically higher than the pre-COVID-19 pandemic.

We measure market liquidity as the log rates of bid-ask spreads in a sample of three cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple) and 16 major fiat currencies from 9 February 2018 to 8 February 2019. We find that the KNN approach is better suited for capturing the market liquidity in a cryptocurrency in the short-term than the ARMA and GARCH models maybe due to the complexity of the microstructure of the market. Considering traditional time series models, we find that ARMA models perform well when estimating the liquidity of fiat currencies in developed markets, whereas GARCH models do the same for fiat currencies in emerging markets. Nevertheless, our results show that the KNN approach can better predict the log rates of the bid-ask spreads of crypto and fiat currencies than ARMA and GARCH models.","[Cortez, Klender; Rodriguez-Garcia, Martha del Pilar] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Contaduria Publ & Adm, San Nicolas De Los Garza 66451, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Mongrut, Samuel] Tecnol Monterrey, EGADE Business Sch, San Pedro Garza Garcia 66269, Mexico; [Mongrut, Samuel] Univ Pacifico, Dept Finanzas, Jesus Maria 15072, Peru","Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon; Tecnologico de Monterrey; Universidad del Pacifico Peru","Rodriguez-Garcia, MD (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Contaduria Publ & Adm, San Nicolas De Los Garza 66451, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.","klender.cortezal@uanl.edu.mx; martha.rodriguezgc@uanl.edu.mx; smongrut@tec.mx","Cortez, Klender/AAI-7416-2021; Mongrut, Samuel/G-5332-2016","Cortez, Klender/0000-0003-1204-5815; Mongrut, Samuel/0000-0003-2081-5576","Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon [CSA1312-20]","Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon","This article was written as part of a research project titled Impact of technology on finance: evolution and future of Fintech (PAICYT, CSA1312-20), which was sponsored by the Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon.","","53","2","2","1","19","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-7390","","MATHEMATICS-BASEL","Mathematics","JAN","2021","9","1","","","","","","","56","10.3390/math9010056","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math9010056","","","15","Mathematics","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Mathematics","PQ0WJ","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000606271000001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The models are validated in a period characterized by unprecedented turmoil and tested in a period of bear markets, allowing the assessment of whether the predictions are good even when the market direction changes between the validation and test periods. The classification and regression methods use attributes from trading and network activity for the period from August 15, 2015 to March 03, 2019, with the test sample beginning on April 13, 2018. For the test period, five out of 18 individual models have success rates of less than 50%. The trading strategies are built on model assembling. The ensemble assuming that five models produce identical signals (Ensemble 5) achieves the best performance for ethereum and litecoin, with annualized Sharpe ratios of 80.17% and 91.35% and annualized returns (after proportional round-trip trading costs of 0.5%) of 9.62% and 5.73%, respectively.

We find that the breakeven transaction costs are substantially higher than those typically found in cryptocurrency markets. To safeguard against data-snooping, we implement a number of multiple hypothesis procedures which confirms our findings that technical trading rules do offer significant predictive power and profitability to investors. We also show that the technical trading rules offer substantially higher risk-adjusted returns than the simple buy-and-hold strategy, showing protection against lengthy and severe drawdowns associated with cryptocurrency markets.

Moreover, an empirical investigation takes place in order to find the impact that TPU exerts on Bitcoin market values by employing a spectrum of Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) specifications. Existing studies support that trade policy uncertainty leads to lower-quality and more expensive products and weak participation in international trade. Moreover, it contributes to lower democratic sentiment, hesitant internal migration and lesser socio-economic mobility and higher fluctuations in profitable assets. Moreover, our econometric findings reveal that TPU positively affects Bitcoin prices while crude oil values negatively influence this major cryptocurrency. Thereby, higher trade policy uncertainty is found to increase demand and favorite investments into risky assets in order to ameliorate the risk-return trade-off in investors' portfolios. This study provides a compass for investing during turmoil due to trade wars and tariffs.","[Kyriazis, Nikolaos A.] Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, Volos 38333, Greece","University of Thessaly","Kyriazis, NA (corresponding author), Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, Volos 38333, Greece.","knikolaos@uth.gr","","KYRIAZIS, NIKOLAOS/0000-0002-1260-4448","","","","","65","4","4","2","11","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

To mitigate these problems, various solutions have been proposed. The lightning network (LN) is considered one of the most promising ones, and it has been widely deployed in different versions. However, the LN itself is subject to a scalability problem due to the used channel state revocation technique. It especially requires O(n) storage cost to store the private keys, where n is the number of transactions that happened in the channel and expected to be infinite. Though there are some techniques to resolve this problem, none of them is compatible with the current Bitcoin system. Aiming at solving this dilemma, in this paper, we propose two space-efficient Bitcoin-compatible key management schemes for the LN, based on the hash function and trapdoor one-way function, respectively. Both schemes reduce the storage complexity from O(n) to O(1). The detailed security analysis shows that our schemes hold the security level of the original LN or its variants. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed schemes are efficient and feasible, with a significant reduction in storage overhead.","[Wei, Guiyi; Mao, Xiaohang; Shao, Jun; Lu, Genhua] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Lu, Rongxing; Guan, Yunguo] Univ New Brunswick, Fac Comp Sci, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada","Zhejiang Gongshang University; University of New Brunswick","Shao, J (corresponding author), Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China.","weigy@zjgsu.edu.cn; mxiaohangg@gmail.com; rlu1@unb.ca; chn.junshao@gmail.com; yguan4@unb.ca; genhualu22@gmail.com","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFB1804500]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LZ18F020003]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1709217]; NSERC [04009];  [LMCRF-S-2020-03]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); ","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFB1804500] , the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [grant number LZ18F020003] , the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number U1709217] , NSERC Discovery Grants (04009) , and LMCRF-S-2020-03.","","36","0","0","1","3","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1389-1286","1872-7069","","COMPUT NETW","Comput.

Although these attacks have been proposed, there lacks a systematic exploration of how these attacks have been conducted and what underlying relationship they have.

Such currencies rely on a peer-to-peer network where users can broadcast transactions containing their pseudonyms and ask for approval. Previous research has shown that application-level eavesdroppers, meaning nodes connected to a large portion of the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network, are able to deanonymize multiple users by tracing back the source of transactions. Yet, such attacks are highly visible as the attacker needs to maintain thousands of outbound connections. Moreover, they can be mitigated by purely application-layer countermeasures. This paper presents a stealthier and harder-to-mitigate attack exploiting the interactions between the networking and application layers. Particularly, the adversary combines her access over Internet infrastructure with application-layer information to deanonymize transactions. We show that this attack, namely PERIMETER, is practical in today's Internet, achieves high accuracy in Bitcoin, and generalizes to encrypted cryptocurrencies e.g., Ethereum.","[Apostolaki, Maria; Maire, Cedric; Vanbever, Laurent] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich","Apostolaki, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.","apmaria@thz.ch","","","","","","","35","1","1","1","2","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-662-64322-8; 978-3-662-64321-1","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2021","12674","","","","","","147","166","","10.1007/978-3-662-64322-8_7","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-64322-8_7","","","20","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS3JR","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000712015400007","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The blocks are to be appended to the digital ledger, the blockchain. The miners compete for the mining of blocks in the main canonical blockchain. A miner can participate in block mining either individually with his computational power or join a mining pool. Here, the classification of crypto address, whether it belongs to a mining pool or an individual miner, is done with a deep learning Keras framework. The classification accuracy of 99.47% is obtained with 100,000 addresses which is higher than the machine learning random forest classification obtained by Kaggle with 22,000 addresses. The miners in mining pools deploy selfish mining or honest mining to mine a block and get the reward accordingly. In block mining, both honest and selfish miners expose the blocks produced by them. The default protocol of the main canonical blockchain leads to the selection of the longest branch of blocks of the selfish miner, discarding the honest miner's block. To alleviate this, we deploy a reinforcement learning algorithm to choose the block with high upper confidence bound value. This selection explores the branch exposed by honest miners. The algorithm is deployed after the first difficulty adjustment algorithm, where there is more selfish mining activity. Our promising results show that the main blockchain exhibits less regret by selecting the honest miner's branch.","[Rakkini, M. J.

After providing an overview of the literature dealing with the topic, it presents an outline of possible scenarios for how cryptocurrencies can be used in corruption-tainted contracts. The scenarios imply that cryptocurrencies can reduce the costs and risks related to a corruption-tainted contract and make it easier to transfer the corruption-based benefits on an anonymous basis. Their existence also allows corruption-tainted contracts to expand to areas where this did not bring any economic advantages in the past. The paper then explores whether there are any empirical correlations between cryptocurrencies and corruption in different countries. The numbers of Bitcoin automated teller machines (ATM) and cryptocurrency users were used as a proxy for cryptocurrencies and the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) as a proxy for corruption. Although we did not find any clear relationships, we discovered that the largest number of owners or users of cryptocurrencies is in countries with a high prevalence of corruption, but the level of corruption in them did not exceed the critical limit (around the value of 30 points of the CPI index).","[Wawrosz, Petr; Lansky, Jan] Univ Finance & Adm, Estonska 500, Prague 10001 10, Czech Republic","University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic","Wawrosz, P (corresponding author), Univ Finance & Adm, Estonska 500, Prague 10001 10, Czech Republic.","wawrosz.petr@mail.vsfs.cz; lansky@mail.vsfs.cz","Lansky, Jan/A-3602-2008; Wawrosz, Petr/GSN-1037-2022","Lansky, Jan/0000-0003-2485-1494; Wawrosz, Petr/0000-0001-8283-4428","","","","","47","0","0","4","17","INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS","BRATISLAVA","SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA","0013-3035","","","EKON CAS","Ekon.

Comparing the dynamics between both datasets with the index cohesive force approach, we assessed how the growth of the initial coin offerings and the exiting cryptocurrencies affected the connectedness of the market. Our results show that the expansion of the cryptocurrency system gave rise to a strong collective movement during 2018-2019. Afterwards, the group pressure, due to the bubble of the initial coin offerings, decreased in favour of the largest cryptocurrencies. Lastly, we observed changes in the hierarchical order of the most influential cryptocurrencies.

These products exhibit rather divergent features but are all either directly or indirectly linked to the blockchain, distributed ledger technology. Premise: We assume that the real innovation behind cryptocurrency is the block-chain, which enables user-to-user trading among decentralized participants and settlement and recordkeeping of such transactions without a trusted, centralized authority. The current generation of digital assets are not fiat money, but rather are functioning as a medium of exchange while some are starting to achieve success as part of alternative investment strategies. Approach: The paper reviews the salient features of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin, altcoins and stablecoins, bitcoin futures, and decentralized finance. Results: This study develops a taxonomy of cryptocurrencies from an economic perspective that will be useful to investors and regulators. The taxonomy shows that while there are overarching features, such as high volatility and the use of decentralized distributed ledgers, cryptocurrencies include a heterogeneous set of products, each with their own risk and return characteristics. Consistency: Potential investors will benefit from a comprehensive overview of the taxonomy of decentralized assets to identify potential investment opportunities. Regulators and policymakers should be able to develop more effective policies and regulations from a clear exposition of the cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance universe.","[van der Merwe, Andria] Compass Lexecon, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [van der Merwe, Andria] Johns Hopkins Inst Appl Econ Global Hlth & Study, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","","van der Merwe, A (corresponding author), Compass Lexecon, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.;van der Merwe, A (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Inst Appl Econ Global Hlth & Study, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.","avandermerwe@compasslexecon.com","","","","","","","26","3","3","2","27","ST JOHNS UNIV BUSINESS RESEARCH INST","JAMAICA","BENT HALL, JAMAICA, NY 11439 USA","0034-6454","","","REV BUS","Rev.

In the short-term, the use of wavelet decomposition shows that Bitcoin provides the best hedge to the Shanghai stock market. In the long-term, commodities dominate. Whereas WTI offers the highest hedging effectiveness, Gold ranks second by a slight margin. These results allow investors to choose the highest returns and protecting tail risk during the current sanitary crisis. Our findings suggest particularly more pronounced economic benefit of diversification including alternative financial assets while commodities futures serve as good hedge assets especially during unpredictable crisis like the current sanitary crisis relating to the covid-19.","[Tarchella, Salma] Univ Sousse, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Cite Erriadh, Sousse 4023, Tunisia; [Dhaoui, Abderrazak] Univ Sousse, IHEC, LaREMFiQ, Sousse, Tunisia; [Dhaoui, Abderrazak] Ipag Business Sch, IPAG Lab, Paris, France","Universite de Monastir; Universite de Sousse; Universite de Carthage; Universite de Sousse; IPAG Business School","Tarchella, S (corresponding author), Univ Sousse, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Cite Erriadh, Sousse 4023, Tunisia.","salmatarchella@yahoo.fr; abderrazak.dhaoui@yahoo.fr","","Tarchella, Salma/0000-0003-1449-4390","","","","","41","4","4","5","12","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0275-5319","1878-3384","","RES INT BUS FINANC","Res.

Our findings contradict the belief in Wall Street that volume can significantly influence price levels and from an economic perspective our model reveals weak positive correlation between return and volume at the tails, which suggests that a misinterpretation among market participants can cause cryptocurrency markets to be relatively illiquid, thus leading to extreme price movements.

The sudden rise and fall of cryptocurrency rates affects the economies and future perspectives of various businesses. In order to minimize business risks, to track the differences and avoid serious economic loss, prediction of daily digital currency rates becomes a crucial task. Our study performs a comparative analysis of Bitcoin price prediction utilizing efficient neural network techniques such as LSTM and GRU.

We analyse a comprehensive dataset from 2015 to 2020 (encompassing 87,780,546 nodes and 856,207,725 transactions) to understand the mechanism that drives their growth. In a seminal analysis, Kondor et al. (PLoS ONE, 2014, 9: e86197) showed that during its first year, the aggregated Bitcoin transaction network grew following linear preferential attachment. For the Ethereum-based cryptoassets, we find that they present in general super-linear preferential attachment, i.e., the probability for a node to receive a new incoming link is proportional to k(alpha), where k is the node's degree. Specifically, we find an exponent alpha = 1.2 for Binance and Chainlink, for Ether alpha = 1.1, and for USDT alpha = 1.05. These results reveal that few nodes become hubs rapidly. We then analyse wealth and degree correlation between tokens since many nodes are active simultaneously in different networks. We conclude that, similarly to what happens in Bitcoin, the rich indeed get richer in Ethereum and related tokens as well, with wealth much more concentrated than in-degree and out-degree.","[De Collibus, Francesco Maria; Piskorec, Matija; Tessone, Claudio J.] Univ Zurich, Blockchain & Distributed Ledger Technol Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Partida, Alberto] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Int Doctoral Sch, Madrid, Spain; [Piskorec, Matija] Rudjer Boskovic Inst, Zagreb, Croatia; [Tessone, Claudio J.] Univ Zurich, UZH Blockchain Ctr, Zurich, Switzerland","University of Zurich; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Rudjer Boskovic Institute; University of Zurich","De Collibus, FM (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Blockchain & Distributed Ledger Technol Grp, Zurich, Switzerland.","francesco.decollibus@business.uzh.ch","","Partida, Alberto/0000-0001-5586-0321; De Collibus, Francesco Maria/0000-0002-9776-4546; Tessone, Claudio J./0000-0001-7733-6221","University of Zurich","University of Zurich","Funding CT acknowledges financial support from the University of Zurich through the University Research Priority Programme on Social Networks.

Firstly, it discusses the relationship between five cryptocurrencies, oil prices, and US indices. Secondly, it focuses on determining the best portfolio hedging strategy. Using daily data relevant to the period ranging from January 4, 2016, to November 29, 2019, this study applies the FIEGARCH-EVT-Copula and Hedge ratios analysis. The findings obtained have shown that the crude oil (WTI) and the US indices return highlights the persistence of a negative and significant leverage effect while the cryptocurrency markets present a positive asymmetric volatility effect. Moreover, this paper show evidence of very weak dependence between all the different pairs considered before and after the introduction of Bitcoin Futures. Based on the Hedging ratio and mean-variance approach, this article suggests that to minimize the risk while keeping the same expected returns of the digital-conventional financial asset portfolio, the investor should hold more conventional financial assets than digital assets except for WTI-Bitcoin, WTI- Dash and WTI-Ethereum pairs which the values of their hedge ratios are rather important with respect to OLS regression.","[Jeribi, Ahmed] Fac Econ & Management Mahdia, Mahdia, Tunisia; [Fakhfekh, Mohamed] Higher Inst Business Adm Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia","Universite de Sfax","Jeribi, A (corresponding author), Fac Econ & Management Mahdia, Mahdia, Tunisia.","ahmedjeribi07@yahoo.fr; fakhfekh_moh@yahoo.fr","jeribi, ahmed/AAG-8273-2021","jeribi, ahmed/0000-0003-3029-1585","","","","","37","11","11","1","6","PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD","BASINGSTOKE","BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND","1470-8272","1479-179X","","J ASSET MANAG","J.

However, the blockchain also faces many challenges, such as security and scalability, which have been the subject of recent researches. Much work has been done to solve the scalability problem in blockchain; one of these methods is sharding. This method is based on dividing the network into different groups and validating transactions in parallel. These methods use traditional consensus algorithms. One of the problems in this regard is the incentive that should be provided for nodes to participate in these consensus algorithms. In this paper, Repchain, one of the existing methods in this field, is examined, and the problems that this method has is analyzed. Next, it is proved that the proposed method causes the network nodes not to follow the protocol and also causes collusion between network nodes.","[Hemati, Mojdeh; Shajari, Mehdi] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Comp Engn, Tehran, Iran","Amirkabir University of Technology","Hemati, M (corresponding author), Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Comp Engn, Tehran, Iran.","M.hemati0094@aut.ac.it; Mshajari@aut.ac.ir","","","","","","","19","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-1241-4","","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/CSICC52343.2021.9420606","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CSICC52343.2021.9420606","","","5","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR9OJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000679167200061","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this paper we argue that the unsustainable trajectory of some cryptocurrencies disproportionately impacts poor and vulnerable communities where cryptocurrency producers and other actors take advantage of economic instabilities, weak regulations, and access to cheap energy and other resources. Globally, over 100 million people hold cryptocurrency, mostly as a speculative asset. The digital infrastructure behind the most popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin, currently requires as much energy as the whole of Thailand, with a carbon footprint exceeding the gold mining industry. Should bitcoin's mass adoption continue, an escalating climate crisis is inevitable, disproportionately exacerbating social and environmental challenges for communities already experiencing multiple dimensions of deprivation. In mitigating these impacts, the paper considers 4 potential regulatory pathways, including: 1) promoting voluntary private-sector commitments to using only renewable energy, 2) encouraging a system of voluntary carbon offsetting, 3) using existing financial regulations and tax frameworks, and 4) imposing national and/or international bans on cryptocurrency 'mining'. The paper argues that effective environmental regulation of cryptocurrencies is urgently required, both to reduce the threat of catastrophic climate change, and to help the world's poorest towards sustainable development. However, regulating cryptocurrency mining in any context is likely to require a combination of efforts and is unlikely to result in win-win outcomes for all.","[Howson, Peter] Northumbria Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [de Vries, Alex] Digiconomist, Almere, Netherlands","Northumbria University","Howson, P (corresponding author), Northumbria Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.","pete.howson@northumbria.ac.uk; alex@digiconomist.net","de Vries, Alex/HCI-0924-2022","de Vries, Alex/0000-0002-9594-1289; Howson, Peter/0000-0002-3731-2775","","","","","75","4","4","6","16","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","2214-6296","2214-6326","","ENERGY RES SOC SCI","Energy Res.

The stock trend is affected by non-linearity, complexity, noise, and especially the surrounding news. External factors such as daily news became one of the investors' primary resources for buying or selling assets. However, this kind of information appears very fast. There are thousands of news generated by different web sources, taking a long time to analyze them, causing significant losses for investors due to late decisions. Although recent contextual language models have transformed the area of natural language processing, models to make predictions using news that influence stock values still face barriers such as unlabeled data and class imbalance. This paper proposes a hybrid methodology that enriches the time series forecasting considering textual knowledge extracted from sites without a widely annotated corpus. We show that the proposed method can improve forecasting using an empirical evaluation of Bitcoin prices prediction.","[Steve Ataucuri Cruz, Lord Flaubert; Silva, Diego Furtado] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Comp, Sao Carlos, Brazil","Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos","Cruz, LFSA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Comp, Sao Carlos, Brazil.","lordataucuri@estudante.ufscar.br; diegofs@ufscar.br","","","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [149096/2018-6]; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) [2019/25010-5]","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP))","This work was financed by the grant #149096/2018-6 Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de N ' ivel Superior (CAPES) and grant #2019/25010-5, S ~ao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP).","","30","0","0","1","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-4337-1","","","","2021","","","","","","","385","390","","10.1109/ICMLA52953.2021.00066","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA52953.2021.00066","","","6","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS9CM","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000779208200058","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Effectively detecting such malicious events should thus be an essential task for securing blockchain networks and services. Due to its importance, several studies investigated anomaly detection in Bitcoin and blockchain networks, but their analyses mainly focused on the blockchain ledger in the application context (e.g., transactions) and targets specific types of attacks (e.g., double-spending, deanonymization, etc). In this study, we present a security mechanism based on the analysis of blockchain network traffic statistics (rather than ledger data) to detect malicious events, through the functions of data collection and anomaly detection. The data collection engine senses the underlying blockchain traffic and generates multi-dimensional data streams in a periodic manner. The anomaly detection engine then detects anomalies from the created data instances based on semi-supervised learning, which is capable of detecting previously unseen patterns, and we introduce our profiling-based detection engine implemented on top of AutoEncoder (AE). Our experimental results support the effectiveness of the presented security mechanism for accurate, online detection of malicious events from blockchain networking traffic data. We also show further reduction in time complexity (up to 66.8% for training and 85.7% for testing), without any performance degradation using feature prioritization compared to the utilization of the entire features.","[Kim, Jinoh; Nakashima, Makiya] Texas A&M Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Commerce, TX 75428 USA; [Fan, Wenjun; Wuthier, Simeon; Zhou, Xiaobo; Chang, Sang-Yoon] Univ Colorado, Dept Comp Sci, Colorado Springs, CO 80918 USA; [Kim, Ikkyun] ETRI, Cybersecur Res Div, Daejeon 34129, South Korea","Texas A&M University System; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado at Colorado Springs; Electronics & Telecommunications Research Institute - Korea (ETRI)","Kim, J (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Commerce, TX 75428 USA.","","","Wuthier, Simeon/0000-0003-4088-7518","Colorado State Bill [18-086]; National Science Foundation [1922410]; Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) - Korean government [20ZR1300]","Colorado State Bill; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) - Korean government","This research was supported in part by Colorado State Bill 18-086 and by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1922410.

Cryptocurrencies analyzed include the Bitcoins, Ethereum, Litecoin, Steller, Bitcoin Cash, and USD Tether. The results suggest that, on average, correlation between digital assets in the cryptocurrencies' ecosystem is positive. However, there is evidence of an outlier with respect to the USD Tether (USDT) in the global market, revealing that the USDT is negatively associated with all other cryptocurrencies. This is supported by the dynamic regression results that provided evidence of reinforcement effect in favor of the USDT in the global crypto market, thus confirming the status of the USDT as Stablecoin as it is pegged 1:1 to USD. In the global market context, the results also revealed that USDT/USD returns had identical outliers that could portend lesser chances of extreme gains or losses compared with suggestions of extreme gains or losses in the EMEs. Furthermore, USDT did not seem to have similar evolution in the EMEs where it had relatively marginal influence in the markets. The vector error correction (VEC) estimate showed mixed results between Altcoins in all the markets; moreover, our finding showed that reinforcement effects hold in favor of Steller (XLM) both in the Russian ruble and Indian rupee crypto markets, whereas the Chinese yuan crypto market was predominantly characterized by substitution effect in favor of Bitcoin.","[Anisiuba, Chika Anastesia; Egbo, Obiamaka P.; Alio, Felix C.; Ifediora, Chuka; Igwemeka, Ebele C.; Odidi, C.

The article proposes two models suitable for adoption and contends that smart contracts as supported by the Ethereum blockchain provides the most ideal structure for contracting parties in such transactions. However, a major inhibitor in its realisation is the current Australian legislative framework, which is outdated and inadequate in supporting novel technologies. Recommendations on how legislators may overcome these limitations are provided. The use of cryptocurrencies in collateralised lending presents an opportunity for prospective lenders to expand their borrowing base, and unlocks an additional avenue for borrowers in attaining finance.","[Chan, Ryan] Univ Melbourne, Laws, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Chan, Ryan] Univ Queensland, Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Chan, Ryan] Univ Queensland, Laws Hons, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","University of Melbourne; University of Queensland; University of Queensland","Chan, R (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Laws, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.;Chan, R (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.;Chan, R (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Laws Hons, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.","","","","","","","","86","0","0","2","2","LAWBOOK CO LTD","PYRMONT","LEVEL 6, 19 HARRIS ST, PYRMONT, NSW 2009, AUSTRALIA","1034-3040","","","J BANK FINANC LAW PR","J.

In particular, they exhibit different return-volatility relationships: While Ethereum and Litecoin show a negative relationship, Chainlink displays a positive one and interestingly, Bitcoin's one changes from negative to positive in June 2016.

Blockchain is regarded as one of the most important next generation infrastructure technologies of the financial industry, as well as artificial intelligence and big data. In 2020, cryptocurrencies based on blockchain, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or XRP, have a value of more than $450 billion in the market capitalization. Furthermore, on blockchains such as Ethereum, transactions can also represent automatic executions of programs, which are called smart contracts. Thus, many institutes in various categories show their positive attitude toward processing financial transactions or non-financial contracts on blockchain. Although many researchers have studied for various types of issues on blockchain, there always exist security and privacy concerns for blockchain. In this paper, we point out a new concern for abusing the publicity of blockchain and also show the possibility of suspicions aroused by the concern. Then we propose a selective mechanism for self-protecting against the approach from crimes or computer viruses on blockchain, whether the disclosure of user's privacy occurs or not. Next, we also propose a concrete implementation of our proposed selective mechanism with two new address types. We aim to incorporate the mechanism in Bitcoin Core, which is the official Bitcoin client software, and using libbitcoin library functions for Bitcoin software development. We show experimental results to estimate overhead costs for processing our proposed address types toward processing the current standard address type in nodes on the peer-to-peer network.","[Kamidoi, Yoko; Wakabayashi, Shin'ichi] Hiroshima City Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Hiroshima 7313194, Japan; [Yamauchi, Ryousuke] Hiroshima City Univ, Fac Informat Sci, Hiroshima 7313194, Japan","","Kamidoi, Y (corresponding author), Hiroshima City Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Hiroshima 7313194, Japan.","yoko@hiroshima-cu.ac.jp","Kamidoi, Yoko/CAF-2511-2022","Kamidoi, Yoko/0000-0001-8690-0904","","","","","21","2","2","4","8","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2021","9","","","","","","24390","24405","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3056623","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3056623","","","16","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","QG1KY","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000617350600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It is a form of digital currency (cryptocurrency) that can be used for trading and has the potential to replace fiat money, where the underlying infrastructure is called Blockchain. The Blockchain is an open ledger that provides decentralization, transparency, immutability, and confidentiality. Blockchain can be used in enormous applications, such as healthcare, logistics, supply chain management, the IoT, and so forth. Most of the industrial applications rely on the permissioned blockchain. However, the permissioned blockchain fails in some aspects, such as interoperability among different platforms. This paper suggests a sustainable system to solve the interoperability issue of the permissioned blockchain by designing a new infrastructure. This work has been tested in ethereum and hyperledger frameworks, which obtained a success rate of 100 percent.","[Punathumkandi, Swathi; Sundaram, Venkatesan Meenakshi] Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Mangalore 575025, Karnataka, India; [Panneer, Prabhavathy] Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Informat Technol & Engn, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India","National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Karnataka; Vellore Institute of Technology","Punathumkandi, S (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Mangalore 575025, Karnataka, India.","swathip.187co005@nitk.edu.in; venkisakthi@nitk.edu.in; pprabhavathy@vit.ac.in","","P, Swathi/0000-0001-8975-8659","","","","","32","1","1","6","19","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2071-1050","","SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL","Sustainability","OCT","2021","13","20","","","","","","","11132","10.3390/su132011132","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132011132","","","12","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","WM8CD","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000711306100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Blockchain provides trust in a decentralised way for storing, managing, and retrieving the transactions. The double-spending issue arises due to the erroneous transaction verification mechanism in the blockchain. Research has shown that transaction malleability like double-spending creates millions of bitcoins losses to the owners as well as few bitcoin exchanges. This research aims to detect and prevent the double-spending of bitcoins in single and multiple blocks. In this context, double-spend data in a single block is identified using the DPL2A method. Further, the original transaction from the double-spend transaction list is identified using the ACRT method which acts as a prevention of double-spend in a forthcoming occurrence. Similarly, double-spend data in multiple blocks are identified using MBDTD along with the Cognizant Merkle tree. Finally, a system named F2DP is constructed to detect and prevent the double-spend data in inter and intra blocks of the blockchain. The result indicates these methods will act best for double-spend detection and prevention with a limited set of transaction records. Further research is needed to increase the scalability of transaction records.","[Vijayalakshmi, J.] Dr Ambedkar Govt Arts Coll Autonomous, Dept Comp Sci, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; Univ Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","University of Madras","Vijayalakshmi, J (corresponding author), Dr Ambedkar Govt Arts Coll Autonomous, Dept Comp Sci, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.","jeyamaha2002@gmail.com; amurugan1972@gmail.com","","","","","","","32","0","0","0","2","INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD","GENEVA","WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG, 29 ROUTE DE PRE-BOIS, CASE POSTALE 856, CH-1215 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND","1742-7185","1742-7193","","INT J COMPUT SCI ENG","Int.

In this paper we explore this new paradigm through a study of BitMEX, one of the first and most successful derivatives platforms for leveraged cryptocurrency trading. BitMEX trades on average over 3 billion dollars worth of volume per day, and allows users to go long or short Bitcoin with up to 100x leverage. We analyze the evolution of BitMEX products-both settled and perpetual offerings that have become the standard across other cryptocurrency derivatives platforms. We additionally utilize on-chain forensics, public liquidation events, and a site-wide chat room to describe the diverse ensemble of amateur and professional traders that forms this community. These traders range from wealthy agents running automated strategies, to individuals trading small, risky positions and focusing on very short time-frames. Finally, we discuss how derivative trading has impacted cryptocurrency asset prices, notably how it has led to dramatic price movements in the underlying spot markets.","[Soska, Kyle; Dong, Jin-Dong; Zetlin-Jones, Ariel; Routledge, Bryan; Christin, Nicolas] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Khodaverdian, Alex] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Carnegie Mellon University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley","Soska, K (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.","ksoska@cmu.edu; jd0@cmu.edu; alexkhodaverdian@berkeley.edu; azj@cmu.edu; routledge@cmu.edu; nicolasc@cmu.edu","Christin, Nicolas/E-3038-2016","Christin, Nicolas/0000-0002-2506-8031","Ripple's University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI) at Carnegie Mellon","Ripple's University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI) at Carnegie Mellon","We thank our anonymous reviewers for helpful feedback, and Flood (https://twitter.com/ThinkingUSD) for insightful discussions.

To prevent the damage caused by illegal transactions, rapid anomaly detection of transactions is required because transactions can be modified before approval. However, existing anomaly detection methods must process all transactions in blockchain, and the processing time is longer than the interval of each approval. In this paper, we propose a subgraph-based anomaly detection method to perform the detection using a part of the blockchain data. The proposed structure of the subgraph is suitable for graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate detection by using parallel processing. In an evaluation using real Bitcoin transaction data, when the number of targeted transactions was one hundred, the proposed method was 11.1x faster than an existing GPU-based method without lowering the detection accuracy.","[Morishima, Shin] Toyama Prefectural Univ, Fac Engn, 5180 Kurokawa, Imizu, Toyama 9390398, Japan","Toyama Prefectural University","Morishima, S (corresponding author), Toyama Prefectural Univ, Fac Engn, 5180 Kurokawa, Imizu, Toyama 9390398, Japan.","morisima@pu-toyama.ac.jp","","Morishima, Shin/0000-0002-1690-6195","JSPS KAKENHI [JP19K24350]","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The author expresses his gratitude for the assistance from to JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP19K24350.","","16","1","1","3","9","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0045-7906","1879-0755","","COMPUT ELECTR ENG","Comput.

In doing so, it distinguishes between privacy and non-privacy coins. Most recently, privacy coins have attracted increasing attention in the public debate as non-privacy cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, do not satisfy some users' demands for anonymity. Analyzing ten cryptocurrencies with the highest market capitalization in each submarket in the 2016-2018 periods, we find that privacy coins exhibit a distinct market equilibrium. Contributing to the current debate on the market efficiency of cryptocurrency markets, our findings provide evidence of market inefficiency. Moreover, the asset market equilibrium of privacy coins appears to originate from non-privacy coins with highest market capitalizations. We argue that the reason for this finding could be that non-privacy coins may be the first choice for criminals who might prefer cryptocurrencies exhibiting both a high level of anonymity and liquidity.","[Sapkota, Niranjan] Univ Vaasa, Vaasa, Finland; [Grobys, Klaus] Univ Vaasa, Finance, Vaasa, Finland","University of Vaasa; University of Vaasa","Sapkota, N (corresponding author), Univ Vaasa, Dept Accounting & Finance, Wolffintie 34, Vaasa 65200, Finland.","niranjan.sapkota@uva.fi; klaus.grobys@uva.fi","","","","","","","48","4","4","1","7","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1042-4431","1873-0612","","J INT FINANC MARK I","J.

It is also intended to provide a method of issuing cryptocurrency before its creation, and an operation method afterwards. Activities before the creation of cryptocurrency must determine desirable behaviors and rewards to create value, and suggest countermeasures to prevent participants from engaging in undesirable behaviors. After the creation of a cryptocurrency, it is necessary to propose a method to induce scarcity and increase demand so that the value of the generated cryptocurrency can be sustained. To observe this, we looked at the contents of the value design of the eight types of cryptocurrencies currently in use in the market. Some cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are choosing mining as a reward, to secure scarcity for maintaining the value of cryptocurrency, limiting the amount of issuance, and burning the already issued cryptocurrency in the market. Also, increasing demand helps maintain the value of cryptocurrency. This study can contribute to supporting the growth of a healthy cryptocurrency market through cryptocurrency-related research.","[Yoo, Soonduck] Hansei Univ, Business Adm, Gunpo 15852, South Korea","Hansei University","Yoo, S (corresponding author), Hansei Univ, Business Adm, Gunpo 15852, South Korea.","koreasally@gmail.com","","","","","","","12","2","2","1","19","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

Much research and many discussions have revolved around policies of governments worldwide in how to handle the new cryptocurrency phenomenon. The purpose of this short study was to observe the valuation impact of that announcement on the three largest cryptocurrencies and two others. Research findings show the altcoins with valuations not tied to the dollar had substantial increases in value while the stablecoins, which the announcement specified are now allowed to be used by banks, changed very little. Specifically, Bitcoin and Etherium increased over 20% in value within 5 days of the announcement while the stablecoins Tether and USDCoin changed in value by no more than 0.10% for the same event window. This shows that stablecoins lived up to their name even though they were promoted as an acceptable payment system in the US.","[Schaub, Mark] Stephen F Austin State Univ, SFA Stn, Dept Econ & Finance, Finance, Nacogdoches, TX 75962 USA","","Schaub, M (corresponding author), Stephen F Austin State Univ, SFA Stn, Dept Econ & Finance, Finance, Nacogdoches, TX 75962 USA.","schaubm@sfasu.edu","","Schaub, Mark/0000-0002-6911-9347","","","","","8","0","0","1","1","CONSCIENTIA BEAM","New York","Rockefeller Center, 45 Rockefeller Plaza,  20th Flr Unit #5, New York, NY, UNITED STATES","2312-6310","2312-430X","","ECON FINANCE LETT","Econ.

The P2P network topologies of popular blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, therefore, deserve our highest attention. The current Ethereum blockchain explorers (e.g., Etherscan) focus on the tracking of block and transaction records but omit the characterization of the underlying P2P network. This work presents the Ethereum Network Analyzer (Ethna), a tool that probes and analyzes the P2P network of the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike Bitcoin that adopts an unstructured P2P network, Ethereum relies on the Kademlia DHT to manage its P2P network. Therefore, the existing analytical methods for Bitcoin-like P2P networks are not applicable to Ethereum. Ethna implements a novel method that accurately measures the degrees of Ethereum nodes. Furthermore, it incorporates an algorithm that derives the latency metrics of message propagation in the Ethereum P2P network. We ran Ethna on the Ethereum Mainnet and conducted extensive experiments to analyze the topological features of its P2P network. Our analysis shows that the Ethereum P2P network possesses a certain effect of small-world networks, and the degrees of nodes follow a power-law distribution that characterizes scale-free networks.","[Wang, Taotao; Zhao, Chonghe; Yang, Qing; Zhang, Shengli] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Liew, Soung Chang] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Informat Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Shenzhen University; Chinese University of Hong Kong","Zhang, SL (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.","ttwang@szu.edu.cn; zhaochonghe_szu@163.com; yang.qing@szu.edu.cn; zsl@szu.edu.cn; soung@ie.cuhk.edu.hk","","Zhang, Shengli/0000-0002-7937-5870; Liew, Soung Chang/0000-0001-7055-6483","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFB2100705]; Chinese NSF [61771315]; Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Province [2020A1515010708]","National Key R&D Program of China; Chinese NSF(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province)","This research was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2018YFB2100705, in part by Chinese NSF project under Grant 61771315, and in part by the Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Province under Grant 2020A1515010708.","","37","7","7","11","17","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA","2327-4697","","","IEEE T NETW SCI ENG","IEEE Trans.

In recent years, the successful integrations of Public-Key Cryptographic (PKC) algorithms with cryptocurrencies have driven researchers to pursue the study of PKC. However, it is challenging to technically integrate PKC algorithms with blockchain properly in that the studies of blockchain leverage to broad domains and each existing problem can lead to diverse solutions. For cryptographically-solvable problems, it is important to find a secure and practical integration of PKC algorithm with blockchain. We systematically review three major topics in cryptocurrencies, including security, privacy and scalability. We conduct a case analysis which demonstrates how to integrate PKC with blockchains. As an illustration, we propose mutable blockchain which incorporates multiple PKC schemes and show how to use it to remove double-spending transactions via redaction. We then give a concrete construction. As suggested by our performance evaluation, the adopted PKC algorithms can run scalably and efficiently and avoid bottlenecks in the system.","[Huang, Ke] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Coll Cyber Secur, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ting] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Mu, Yi] City Univ Macao, Inst Data Sci, Macau, Peoples R China; [Rezaeibagha, Fatemeh] Murdoch Univ, Murdoch, WA, Australia","University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; City University of Macau; Murdoch University","Mu, Y (corresponding author), City Univ Macao, Inst Data Sci, Macau, Peoples R China.","","","","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0802300, 2018YFB0804100, 2018YFB08040505]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62002048, 61872087, 61872057, U19A2066]; University Startup Grant [Y030202059018061]; Blockchain Research Lab of UESTC, Chengdu Jiaozi Financial Holding Group Company Ltd.; China Mobile Information Communication Technology Co., Ltd, Chengdu; 2020 UAV Operation Management Platform Phase II (Package 2: Safety Subsystem) [CMCMII-202001245]","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); University Startup Grant; Blockchain Research Lab of UESTC, Chengdu Jiaozi Financial Holding Group Company Ltd.; China Mobile Information Communication Technology Co., Ltd, Chengdu; 2020 UAV Operation Management Platform Phase II (Package 2: Safety Subsystem)","This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant No. 2017YFB0802300, Grant No. 2018YFB0804100, and Grant No. 2018YFB08040505; the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62002048, 61872087, 61872057, and U19A2066; the University Startup Grant under Grant No. Y030202059018061; and the Blockchain Research Lab of UESTC, Chengdu Jiaozi Financial Holding Group Company Ltd.; China Mobile Information Communication Technology Co., Ltd, Chengdu; 2020 UAV Operation Management Platform Phase II (Package 2: Safety Subsystem) No. CMCMII-202001245.","","14","0","0","2","6","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","0890-8044","1558-156X","","IEEE NETWORK","IEEE Netw.","NOV-DEC","2021","35","6","","","","","240","246","","10.1109/MNET.101.2100088","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MNET.101.2100088","","NOV 2021","7","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","YK8ZD","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000732815800001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The first and best-known cryptocurrency example is bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are used to make transactions anonymously and securely over the internet. The decentralization behavior of a cryptocurrency has radically reduced central control over them, thereby influencing international trade and relations. Wide fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices motivate the urgent requirement for an accurate model to predict its price. Cryptocurrency price prediction is one of the trending areas among researchers. Research work in this field uses traditional statistical and machine-learning techniques, such as Bayesian regression, logistic regression, linear regression, support vector machine, artificial neural network, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. No seasonal effects exist in cryptocurrency, making it hard to predict using a statistical approach. Traditional statistical methods, although simple to implement and interpret, require a lot of statistical assumptions that could be unrealistic, leaving machine learning as the best technology in this field, being capable of predicting price based on experience. This article provides a comprehensive summary of the previous studies in the field of cryptocurrency price prediction from 2010 to 2020. The discussion presented in this article will help researchers to fill the gap in existing studies and gain more future insight.","[Khedr, Ahmed M.; Arif, Ifra; Raj, Pravija P., V; Sreedharan, Meenu] Univ Sharjah, Dept Comp Sci, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates; [Khedr, Ahmed M.] Zagazig Univ, Math Dept, Zagazig, Egypt; [El-Bannany, Magdi] Univ Sharjah, Dept Accounting, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates; [Alhashmi, Saadat M.] Univ Sharjah, Dept Informat Syst, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates","University of Sharjah; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Zagazig University; University of Sharjah; University of Sharjah","Khedr, AM (corresponding author), Univ Sharjah, Dept Comp Sci, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates.","akhedr@sharjah.ac.ae","","El-Bannany, Magdi/0000-0001-8795-3661","","","","","141","7","7","25","72","JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD","CHICHESTER","THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND","1055-615X","1099-1174","","INTELL SYST ACCOUNT","Intell.

Although current P2P accommodation platforms use rating systems and arbitrations to solve the problems, they may not be practical in reality, since interpersonal expectations and interactions between a guest and a host play an important role in rating a P2P accommodation. In this paper, we introduce a new technique based on a credit network to solve these problems. A credit network is a network that uses currency to model transitive trust (or credit) between different users in a distributed fashion. It is modified from the current Bitcoin-based credit network by using a trusted hardware and a protocol for a guest to book a P2P accommodation without revealing unnecessary private information of either the guest or the host with high efficiency. Security and performance analysis shows that our scheme can help a guest find a trustworthy host in a privacy-preserving way, while still achieving high efficiency.","[Li, Songwei; Wang, Zhen; Zhang, Chi; Wei, Lingbo] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Cyberspace Sci & Technol, Hefei 230027, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jianqing] Univ Alabama, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA; [Ma, Ying; Fang, Yuguang] Univ Florida, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Huntsville; State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Zhang, C (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Cyberspace Sci & Technol, Hefei 230027, Anhui, Peoples R China.","bgplsw@mail.ustc.edu.cn; wang1992@mail.ustc.edu.cn; chizhang@ustc.edu.cn; lingbowei@ustc.edu.cn; jiangqing.liu@uah.edu; mayinggator@ufl.edu; fang@ece.ufl.edu","zhang, chi/GRX-3610-2022; Fang, Yuguang/A-7484-2009","Fang, Yuguang/0000-0002-1079-3871","Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [62072426, U19B2023, 61871362]","Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under grants 62072426, U19B2023, and 61871362.","","10","1","1","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-86130-8; 978-3-030-86129-2","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2021","12938","","","","","","326","337","","10.1007/978-3-030-86130-8_26","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-86130-8_26","","","12","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Mathematics; Telecommunications","BS5DH","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000728191600026","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Because online payment and data security issues are involved in outsourcing services, the mutual distrust between users and service providers may severely impede the wide adoption of cloud computing. Nevertheless, most existing solutions only consider a specific type of services and rely on a trusted third-party to realize fair payment. In this paper, to realize secure and fair payment of outsourcing services in general without relying on any third-party, trusted or not, we introduce BPay, an outsourcing service fair payment framework based on blockchain in cloud computing. We first propose the system architecture, adversary model and design goals of BPay, then describe the design details. Our security and compatibility analysis indicates that BPay achieves soundness and robust fairness and it is compatible with the Bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain. The key to the robust fairness and compatibility lies in an all-or-nothing checking-proof protocol and a top-down checking method. In addition, our experimental results show that BPay is computationally efficient. Finally, we present the applications of BPay in outsourcing services.","[Zhang, Yinghui; Zheng, Dong] Xian Univ Posts & Telecommun, Natl Engn Lab Wireless Secur, Xian 710121, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yinghui; Deng, Robert H.; Liu, Ximeng] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Informat Syst, Singapore, Singapore; [Zhang, Yinghui; Zheng, Dong] Westone Cryptol Res Ctr, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China","Xi'an University of Posts & Telecommunications; Singapore Management University","Zhang, YH; Zheng, D (corresponding author), Xian Univ Posts & Telecommun, Natl Engn Lab Wireless Secur, Xian 710121, Peoples R China.;Zhang, YH (corresponding author), Singapore Management Univ, Sch Informat Syst, Singapore, Singapore.","yhzhaang@163.com; robertdeng@smu.edu.sg; snbnix@gmail.com; zhengdong@xupt.edu.cn","","Deng, Robert/0000-0003-3491-8146; Liu, Ximeng/0000-0002-4238-3295","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0802000]; AXA Research Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61772418, 61472472, 61402366]; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China [2018JZ6001, 2015JQ6236]; New Star Team of Xi'an University of Posts & Telecommunications [2016-02]","National Key R&D Program of China; AXA Research Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China; New Star Team of Xi'an University of Posts & Telecommunications","The authors would like to thank the anonymous associate Editor and referees for their invaluable suggestions.

We compute the exact profitability and the minimal double spend that is profitable for this strategy. For a given amount of the transaction, we determine the minimal number of confirmations to be requested by the recipient that makes the double-spend strategy non-profitable. This number of confirmations is only 1 or 2 for average transactions and for a small relative hashrate of the attacker. This is substantially lower than the original Nakamoto number, which is about six confirmations and is widely used.

Although cryptocurrencies represent a breakthrough and provide some important benefits, their usage poses some risks that are a result of the lack of supervising institutions and transparency. Because disinformation and volatility is discouraging for personal investors, cryptocurrencies emerged hand-in-hand with the proliferation of online users' communities and forums as places to share information that can alleviate users' mistrust. This research focuses on the study of the interplay between these cryptocurrency forums and fluctuations in cryptocurrency values. In particular, the most popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) and a related active discussion community, Bitcointalk, are analyzed. This study shows that the activity of Bitcointalk forum keeps a direct relationship with the trend in the values of BTC, therefore analysis of this interaction would be a perfect base to support personal investments in a non-regulated market and, to confirm whether cryptocurrency forums show evidences to detect abnormal behaviors in BTC values as well as to predict or estimate these values. The experiment highlights that forum data can explain specific events in the financial field. It also underlines the relevance of quotes (regular mechanism to response a post) at periods: (1) when there is a high concentration of posts around certain topics; (2) when peaks in the BTC price are observed; and, (3) when the BTC price gradually shifts downwards and users intend to sell.","[Fernandez Vilas, Ana; Diaz Redondo, Rebeca P.; Couto Cancela, Daniel; Torrado Pazos, Alejandro] Univ Vigo, Informat & Comp Lab, AtlanTTic Res Ctr, Vigo 36310, Pontevedra, Spain","Universidade de Vigo; atlanTTic","Vilas, AF (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Informat & Comp Lab, AtlanTTic Res Ctr, Vigo 36310, Pontevedra, Spain.","avilas@det.uvigo.es; rebeca@det.uvigo.es; idab@det.uvigo.es; iclab2@det.uvigo.es","Diaz Redondo, Rebeca P./L-3108-2014; Fernandez Vilas, Ana/L-2055-2014","Diaz Redondo, Rebeca P./0000-0002-2367-2219; Fernandez Vilas, Ana/0000-0003-1047-2143","European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); Galician Regional Government; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, under the National Science Program [TEC2017-84197-C4-2-R]","European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Commission); Galician Regional Government; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, under the National Science Program","The authors would like to thank the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Galician Regional Government, under the agreement for funding the AtlanTTic Research Center, and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, under the National Science Program (TEC2017-84197-C4-2-R).

This article aims to compare approaches to the assessing cryptocurrencies development using the number of active Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets. For this purpose, a deterministic model based on the Verhulst equation, and a stochastic model based on ARIMA was formulated. The results show that the usage of relative differences wins over absolute ones. At the same time, the predictive value of a purely deterministic model on short segments is not very high, but it has the advantage in analytical form. Further will focus on the combination of a deterministic Bass-type model and statistical methods with stochastic analysis tools.","[Dostov, Victor; Pimenov, Pavel; Shoust, Pavel] St Petersburg State Univ, Fed State Budgetary Educ Inst Higher Educ, 7-9 Univ Skaya Emb, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Dostov, Victor; Pimenov, Pavel; Shoust, Pavel] Russian Elect Money & Remittance Assoc, 5-2 Orlikov Per, Moscow, Russia","Saint Petersburg State University","Dostov, V (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, Fed State Budgetary Educ Inst Higher Educ, 7-9 Univ Skaya Emb, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.;Dostov, V (corresponding author), Russian Elect Money & Remittance Assoc, 5-2 Orlikov Per, Moscow, Russia.","dostov@npaed.ru","; Shust, Pavel/P-1632-2018","Dostov, Victor/0000-0003-4518-2883; Shust, Pavel/0000-0002-2276-7523","","","","","15","0","0","1","1","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-86973-1; 978-3-030-86972-4","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2021","12952","","","","","","19","30","","10.1007/978-3-030-86973-1_2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-86973-1_2","","","12","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Mathematics","BS4SU","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000722424200002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This study provides high transaction throughput on critical IoT applications, particularly Bitcoin security against double-spending attacks. To this end, we investigated the signaling game approach to model the interaction between two miners while considering players behavior (malicious or honest miners) and the incoming transaction throughput. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits the signaling game to cover the incoming transactions randomness waiting for validation, which influences the honest miners behavior. With extensive simulations, we show that our proposed signaling game reduces the impact of double-spending attacks on IoT transactions. The results also illustrate the benefit of using the signaling game to model the interaction between two miners while handling the incomplete information of the incoming transactions and the type of miners.","[Benaddi, Hafsa; Jouhari, Mohammed; Ibrahimi, Khalil] Ibn Tofail Univ, Fac Sci, LaRI Lab, Kenitra, Morocco; [Benslimane, Abderrahim] Univ Avignon, CERI, LIA, Avignon, France","Ibn Tofail University of Kenitra; Avignon Universite","Benaddi, H (corresponding author), Ibn Tofail Univ, Fac Sci, LaRI Lab, Kenitra, Morocco.","hafsa.benaddi@uit.ac.ma; jouhari4med@gmail.com; ibrahimi.khalil@uit.ac.ma; abderrahim.benslimane@univ-avignon.fr","Jouhari, Mohammed/AAB-7049-2020","Jouhari, Mohammed/0000-0001-5406-8594; Hafsa, BENADDI/0000-0003-2489-0637","","","","","20","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2334-0983","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8104-2","IEEE GLOB COMM CONF","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685598","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685598","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BT0PJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000790747203020","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Traditional covert channels have become insecure due to the continuous improvement of traffic analysis techniques. In this context, there is an urgent need to identify new approaches for covert channels. Blockchain is an emerging technique with characteristics of user anonymity, a flooding propagation mechanism, and tamper resistance, which make it a compelling platform for covert channels. Previous approaches applied Bitcoin as the underlying blockchain, and its pseudoanonymity may expose the communication relationship. Moreover, the reliance of these approaches on prenegotiated labels to identify transactions containing covert messages further reduced their concealment. In this work, we present a practical and secure covert channel over Monero. Compared to Bitcoin, Monero's full anonymity efficiently protects the relationship between the sender and receiver. Moreover, no labels are employed to identify special transactions. The receiver filters and extracts the covert message using his private key. In this study, we make a complete assessment of the robustness, reliability, and anti-traceability of our protocol, as these properties are regarded as desirable for a covert channel. We also formalize the definition of security for covert channels through a transaction distinguishing experiment. A rigorous proof shows that our protocol meets this definition and is secure to use. Finally, we make a detailed comparison between our protocol and the existing blockchain-based covert channels.","[Guo, Zhaozhong; Shi, Liucheng; Xu, Maozhi] Peking Univ, Sch Math Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Yin, Hong] China Acad Railway Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Peking University","Xu, MZ (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Math Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.","mzxu@math.pku.edu.cn","","Guo, Zhaozhong/0000-0002-2425-5863; Shi, Liucheng/0000-0003-0506-8701","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [62072011, 61672059]","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant 62072011 and Grant 61672059.","","30","2","2","5","9","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2021","9","","","","","","31816","31825","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3060285","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3060285","","","10","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","QO8TO","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000623410300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Although it seems attractive to employ tokens as countermeasures for cryptocurrency leakage, Mosaic is a specific token for the New Economy Movement (NEM) cryptocurrency and is not employed for other blockchain systems or cryptocurrencies. Moreover, although some volunteers tracked leaked NEM using Mosaic in the CoinCheck incident, it would be better to verify that the volunteers can be trusted. Simultaneously, if someone (e.g., who stole cryptocurrencies) can identify the volunteers, then that person or organization may be targets of them. In this paper, we propose an anonymous trust-marking scheme on blockchain systems that is universally applicable to any cryptocurrency. In our scheme, entities called token admitters are allowed to generate tokens adding trustworthiness or untrustworthiness to addresses. Anyone can anonymously verify whether these tokens were issued by a token admitter. Simultaneously, only the designated auditor and no one else, including nondesignated auditors, can identify the token admitters. Our scheme is based on accountable ring signatures and commitment, and is implemented on an elliptic curve called Curve25519, and we confirm that both cryptographic tools are efficient.

Moreover, the findings generated from the multiple wavelet coherence illustrate the simultaneous contribution of cryptocurrencies and the Sentix Investor Confidence index in explaining the Bitcoin index movement across frequencies and over horizons, especially during bubble burst periods.

To the best of our knowledge, it is the first approach capable of facilitating double-spend collusion across different blockchains. Moreover, our technique can also be used to specifically incentivize transaction exclusion or (re)ordering. For our construction we rely on smart contracts to render the payment and receipt of bribes trustless for the briber as well as the bribee. Attacks using our approach are operated and financed out-of-band i.e., on a funding cryptocurrency, while the consequences are induced in a different target cryptocurrency. Hereby, the main requirement is that smart contracts on the funding cryptocurrency are able to verify consensus rules of the target. For a concrete instantiation of our P2W method, we choose Bitcoin as a target and Ethereum as a funding cryptocurrency. Our P2W method is designed in a way that reimburses collaborators even in the case of an unsuccessful attack. Interestingly, this actually renders our approach approximately one order of magnitude cheaper than comparable bribing techniques (e.g., the whale attack). We demonstrate the technical feasibility of P2W attacks through publishing all relevant artifacts of this paper, ranging from calculations of success probabilities to a fully functional proof-of-concept implementation, consisting of an Ethereum smart contract and a Python client.","[Judmayer, Aljosha; Stifter, Nicholas] SBA Res, Vienna, Austria; [Judmayer, Aljosha; Stifter, Nicholas; Weippl, Edgar] Uni Wien, Vienna, Austria; [Zamyatin, Alexei] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Tsabary, Itay; Eyal, Ittay] Technion, Haifa, Israel; [Tsabary, Itay; Eyal, Ittay] IC3, Haifa, Israel; [Gazi, Peter] IOHK, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Meiklejohn, Sarah] UCL, London, England","Imperial College London; University of London; University College London","Judmayer, A (corresponding author), SBA Res, Vienna, Austria.;Judmayer, A (corresponding author), Uni Wien, Vienna, Austria.","ajudmayer@sba-research.org; nstifter@sba-research.org; a.zamyatin@imperial.ac.uk; Ittay@technion.ac.il; peter.gazi@iohk.io; s.meiklejohn@ucl.ac.uk; edgar.weippl@univie.ac.at","","Weippl, Edgar/0000-0003-0665-6126","Christian-Doppler Laboratory for Security and Quality Improvement in the Production System Lifecycle; Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; Nation Foundation for Research, Technology and Development; University of Vienna, Faculty of Computer Science, Security Privacy Group; SBA Research; competence center SBA Research (SBA-K1); federal state of Vienna; FFG Bridge 1 project [864738]; US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF); Israel Cyber Bureau; Technion Hiroshi Fujiwara cyber-security research center","Christian-Doppler Laboratory for Security and Quality Improvement in the Production System Lifecycle; Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; Nation Foundation for Research, Technology and Development; University of Vienna, Faculty of Computer Science, Security Privacy Group; SBA Research; competence center SBA Research (SBA-K1); federal state of Vienna; FFG Bridge 1 project; US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF)(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation); Israel Cyber Bureau; Technion Hiroshi Fujiwara cyber-security research center","This paper is based upon work partially supported by (1) the Christian-Doppler Laboratory for Security and Quality Improvement in the Production System Lifecycle; The financial support by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs, the Nation Foundation for Research, Technology and Development and University of Vienna, Faculty of Computer Science, Security & Privacy Group is gratefully acknowledged; (2) SBA Research; the competence center SBA Research (SBA-K1) funded within the framework of COMET Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies by BMVIT, BMDW, and the federal state of Vienna, managed by the FFG; (3) the FFG Bridge 1 project 864738 PR4DLT.

A Case Study on the Use of Balanced LDA and the Reference Architecture of a Domain to Capture Online Discussions About Blockchain Platforms Across Stack Exchange Communities","IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING","","","English","Article","","","","","","Blockchain; Peer-to-peer computing; Computer architecture; Smart contracts; Programming; Bitcoin; Empirical study; reference architecture; blockchain; stack overflow; stack exchange","TOPICS; RETRIEVAL; BITCOIN","Blockchain-related discussions have become increasingly prevalent in programming Q&A websites, such as Stack Overflow and other Stack Exchange communities. Analyzing and understanding those discussions could provide insights about the topics of interest to practitioners, and help the software development and research communities better understand the needs and challenges facing developers as they work in this new domain. Prior studies propose the use of LDA to study the Stack Exchange discussions. However, a simplistic use of LDA would capture the topics in discussions blindly without keeping in mind the variety of the dataset and domain-specific concepts. Specifically, LDA is biased towards larger sized corpora; and LDA-derived topics are not linked to higher level domain-specific concepts. We propose an approach that combines balanced LDA (which ensures that the topics are balanced across a domain) with the reference architecture of a domain to capture and compare the popularity and impact of discussion topics across the Stack Exchange communities. Popularity measures the distribution of interest in discussions, and impact gauges the trend of popularity over time. We made a number of interesting observations, including: (1) Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and Corda are the four most commonly-discussed blockchain platforms on the Stack Exchange communities. (2) A broad range of topics are discussed across the various platforms of distinct layers in our derived reference architecture. (3) The Application layer topics exhibit the highest popularity (33.2 percent) and fastest growth in topic impact since November 2015. (4) The Application, API, Consensus and Network layer topics are discussed across the studied blockchain platforms, but exhibit different distributions in popularity. (5) The impact of architectural layer topics exhibits an upward trend, but is growing at different speeds across the studied blockchain platforms. The breakdown of the topic impact across the architectural layers is relatively stable over time except for the Hyperledger Fabric platform. Based on our findings, we highlighted future directions and provided recommendations for practitioners and researchers.","[Wan, Zhiyuan] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xia, Xin] Monash Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Hassan, Ahmed E.] Queens Univ, Sch Comp, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada","Zhejiang University; Monash University; Queens University - Canada","Xia, X (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.","wanzhiyuan@zju.edu.cn; xin.xia@monash.edu; ahmed@cs.queensu.ca","Xia, Xin/AAD-6217-2022","Xia, Xin/0000-0002-6302-3256; Wan, Zhiyuan/0000-0001-7657-6653","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018Y FB1003904]; NSFC Program [61602403]; Project of Science and Technology Research and Development Program of China Railway Corporation [P2018X002]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","National Key Research and Development Program of China; NSFC Program(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Project of Science and Technology Research and Development Program of China Railway Corporation; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This research was partially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018Y FB1003904), NSFC Program (No. 61602403), Project of Science and Technology Research and Development Program of China Railway Corporation (P2018X002), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.","","94","12","12","2","12","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA","0098-5589","1939-3520","","IEEE T SOFTWARE ENG","IEEE Trans.

Most of these applications trust that the blockchain will prevent issues like fraud, thanks to the built-in cryptographic mechanisms provided by the data structure and the consensus protocol. However, blockchains suffer from what is called a 51% attack or majority attack, which is considered a high risk for the integrity of these blockchains, where if a miner, or a group of them, has more than half the computing capability of the network, it can rewrite the blockchain. Even though this attack is possible in theory, it is regarded as hard-achievable in practice, due to the assumption that, with enough active members, it is very complicated to have that much computing power; however, this assumption has not been studied with enough detail. In this work, a detailed characterization of the miners in the Bitcoin and Crypto Ethereum blockchains is presented, with the aim of proving the computing distribution assumption and creating profiles that may allow the detection of anomalous behaviors and prevent 51% attacks. The results of the analysis show that, in the last years, there has been an increasing concentration of hash rate power in a very small set of miners, which generates a real risk for current blockchains. Also, that there is a pattern in mining among the main miners, which makes it possible to identify out-of-normal behavior.","[Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andres; Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval; Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo] Univ Norte, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Barranquilla 081001, Colombia; [Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andres] Univ Santo Tomas, Dept Syst Engn, Tunja 150009, Colombia; [Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval] Univ Complutense Madrid UCM, Fac Comp Sci & Engn, Dept Software Engn & Artificial Intelligence DIS, Grp Anal Secur & Syst GASS, Off 431, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Wightman, Pedro] Univ Rosario, Escuela Ingn Ciencia & Tecnol, Bogota 111711, Colombia","Universidad del Norte; Universidad Santo Tomas USTA; Complutense University of Madrid; Universidad del Rosario","Aponte-Novoa, FA (corresponding author), Univ Norte, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Barranquilla 081001, Colombia.;Aponte-Novoa, FA (corresponding author), Univ Santo Tomas, Dept Syst Engn, Tunja 150009, Colombia.","faponte@uninorte.edu.co","Novoa, Fredy Andres Aponte/T-9633-2018; Wightman, Pedro/M-9795-2018; Sandoval Orozco, Ana Lucila/H-4148-2012","Novoa, Fredy Andres Aponte/0000-0003-3773-4414; Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo/0000-0002-8682-4830; Wightman, Pedro/0000-0002-7641-2090; Sandoval Orozco, Ana Lucila/0000-0002-2846-9017","Doctorado Nacional Convocatoria para la Formacion de Capital Humano de Alto Nivel para el Departamento de Boyaca; Universidad del Norte","Doctorado Nacional Convocatoria para la Formacion de Capital Humano de Alto Nivel para el Departamento de Boyaca; Universidad del Norte","This work was supported in part by the Program ``Convocatoria 779 de 2017 Doctorado Nacional Convocatoria para la Formacion de Capital Humano de Alto Nivel para el Departamento de Boyaca 2017,'' and in part by the Universidad del Norte.","","42","4","4","5","16","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2021","9","","","","","","140549","140564","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119291","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119291","","","16","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","WJ5CK","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000709062400001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The results from Quantile-on-Quantile Regression (QQR) approach reveal that the changing intensity levels of the COVID-19 affect the Bearish and the Bullish market scenarios of cryptocurrencies differently (asymmetric impact). Additionally, there are differences between these currencies in their responses to the changing levels of this pandemic's intensity. Most of the currencies absorbed the small shocks of COVID-19 by registering positive gains but failed to resist against the huge changes except Bitcoin, ADA, CRO, and up to some extent Ethereum. Our results reveal new and asymmetric dynamics of this emerging asset class against an extremely stressful and unpredictable event (COVID-19). Moreover, these results are robust to the use of alternative proxy (COVID-19 deaths) for pandemic intensity.

Macroeconomic variables data were gained from Yahoo Finance website spanning a 4-year interval with a hourly resolution, while technical indicators data are provided by the python talib library. The variance problem on test samples has been taken into account through the cross validation technique which also allowed to evaluate a more reliable estimate of the model's performance. Furthermore, the Grid Search technique was used to find the best hyperparameters values for each implemented algorithm. The results were evaluated in terms of the well known classification metrics, i.e. accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score.

Such indices are used to specifically measure the performance of Chinese companies who are inherently involved in the R&D and production of materials and products used to mitigate and counteract the effects of influenza and coronavirus, therefore, such indices present a unique barometer of broad population-based sentiment relating to COVID-19 in comparison to traditional Chinese influenza. Within days of the formal announcement of the COVID-19 outbreak, results indicate exceptionally pronounced and persistent impacts of the coronavirus pandemic upon Chinese financial markets, compared to that of the traditional and long-standing influenza index. Further, in a novel finding to date, COVID-19 is found to have had a substantial effect on directional spillovers upon the Bitcoin market. Cryptocurrency-based confidence appears to have been instigated through government-developed education schemes, which are identified as one possible explanation for our results, which are found to remain robust across both data-frequency and methodological variation.","[Corbet, Shaen; Hou, Yang (Greg); Hu, Yang; Oxley, Les; Xu, Danyang] Univ Waikato, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Corbet, Shaen] Dublin City Univ, DCU Business Sch, Dublin 9, Ireland","University of Waikato; Dublin City University","Corbet, S (corresponding author), Univ Waikato, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand.","shaen.corbet@dcu.ie","Corbet, Shaen/B-4869-2017","Corbet, Shaen/0000-0001-7430-7417; Hou, Yang/0000-0003-0017-9912; Hu, Yang/0000-0001-9277-8992","","","","","85","65","65","13","44","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1059-0560","1873-8036","","INT REV ECON FINANC","Int.

The results demonstrated dynamic spillovers, which intensified after 2017. Furthermore, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are net transmitters of risk, which can be a contagion source; Dash, Ripple, Monero, Stellar, and Nem are net receivers of risk. Moreover, the short-term risk spillover is more pronounced than the medium- and long-term risk spillovers, which also increased after 2017. The directional spillovers among cryptocurrencies is sensitive to frequencies. Finally, adding a cryptocurrency to a benchmark Bitcoin portfolio provides diversification benefits and downside risk reductions. In contrast, adding Bitcoin to a cryptocurrency portfolio do not offers diversification opportunities.","[Mensi, Walid] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Inst Business Res, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Mensi, Walid] South Ural State Univ, 76 Lenin Prospekt, Chelyabinsk, Russia; [Al-Yahyaee, Khamis Hamed] Muscat Univ, Muscat, Oman; [Al-Jarrah, Idries Mohammad Wanas] Qatar Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Doha, Qatar; [Vo, Xuan Vinh] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Inst Business Res, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Vo, Xuan Vinh] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, CFVG, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Kang, Sang Hoon] Pusan Natl Univ, PNU Business Sch, Jangjeon2 Dong, Busan 609735, South Korea; [Kang, Sang Hoon] Univ South Australia, UniSA Business, Adelaide, SA, Australia","Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; South Ural State University; Qatar University; Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; Pusan National University; University of South Australia","Kang, SH (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, PNU Business Sch, Jangjeon2 Dong, Busan 609735, South Korea.","walidmensi1@gmail.com; kalyahyaee@muscatuniversity.edu.om; idries@qu.edu.qa; vxvinh@yahoo.com; sanghoonkang@pusan.ac.kr","Al-Jarrah, Idries/GRJ-0970-2022","","University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2020S1A5B8103268]","University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This research is partly funded by the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

Most of the existing solutions rely on a Trusted Third Party (TTP) in order to achieve fairness, which can become a bottleneck and lead to more charges and computations. Other solutions that do not rely on a TTP have a relatively high computation and communication overhead. Blockchains have allowed the creation of TTP-free protocols for fair exchange; however, the existing Blockchain-based protocols are either too expensive or do not meet the necessary fairness and confidentiality guarantees. In this work, we have developed two TTP-free Blockchain-based protocols for certified electronic mail that achieve the required security properties of strong fairness, non-repudiation, timeliness, and confidentiality. The first protocol uses simple bitcoin transactions for a single receiver, whereas the second one implements smart contracts for one or multiple receivers. We have analyzed and compared both protocols to existing TTP-free Blockchain solutions and have demonstrated their superior properties and cost. Furthermore, we have implemented the two protocols in a realistic testbed, demonstrating the viability of our approach.","[Elmaghraby, Karim; Dimitriou, Tassos] Kuwait Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Safat 13060, Kuwait","Kuwait University","Dimitriou, T (corresponding author), Kuwait Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Safat 13060, Kuwait.","tassos.dimitriou@ieee.org","","","Kuwait University [EO 01/20]","Kuwait University","This work was supported by Kuwait University Research Grant EO 01/20.","","49","0","0","1","2","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2021","9","","","","","","100708","100724","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3096661","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3096661","","","17","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","TL9PK","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000675184800001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

First, it models and forecasts the risk of the five leading cryptocurrencies, stock market indices (developed and BRICS) and gold returns. Second, it conducts different backtesting procedures forecasts. Third, it focuses on the hedging potential of cryptocurrencies and gold. Design/methodology/approach The authors used the generalized autoregressive score (GAS) models to model and forecast the risk of cryptocurrencies, stock market indices and gold returns. They conduct different backtesting procedures of the 1% and 5%-value-at-risk (VaR) forecasts. They also use the generalized orthogonal generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GO-GARCH) model to explore the hedging potential of cryptocurrencies by estimating the dynamic conditional correlation between cryptocurrencies and gold, on the one hand, and stock markets on the other hand. Findings When conducting different backtesting procedures of VaR, our finding suggests that Bitcoin has the highest VaR among cryptocurrencies and Gold and the BRICS indices returns have lower VaR compared to the developed countries. Finally, we provide evidence that the risks among developed stock markets can be hedged by Bitcoin and Gold. Bitcoin can be considered as the new Gold for these economies. Unlike Bitcoin, Gold can be considered as a hedge for Chinese and Indian investors. However, Gold and Bitcoin can be considered as diversifier assets for the other BRICS economies while Dash and Monero are diversifier assets for developed stock markets. Originality/value The first paper's empirical contribution lies in analyzing optimal forecast models for cryptocurrencies (other than Bitcoin) returns and risk. The second contribution consists of studying the hedging potential of five leading cryptocurrencies. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the role of cryptocurrencies for BRICS investors.","[Jeribi, Ahmed] Univ Monastir, Fac Sci Econ & Gest Mahdia, Monastir, Tunisia; [Ghorbel, Achraf] Univ Sfax, Fac Sci Econ & Gest Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia","Universite de Monastir; Universite de Gafsa; Universite de Sfax","Jeribi, A (corresponding author), Univ Monastir, Fac Sci Econ & Gest Mahdia, Monastir, Tunisia.","ahmedjeribi07@yahoo.fr; ghorbelachraf@yahoo.fr","jeribi, ahmed/AAG-8273-2021","Ghorbel, Achraf/0000-0001-6303-5612; jeribi, ahmed/0000-0003-3029-1585","","","","","71","6","6","5","14","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1746-8809","1746-8817","","INT J EMERG MARK","Int.

Analysis: Using participatory observation supplemented with publicly available material, this article examines the ideologies and imaginaries surrounding Ethereum and how they are articulated with its technical design. Conclusion and implications: Ethereum's design ostensibly widens the ideological spectrum of cryptocurrency while masking certain currency ideologies still prominent within it. This complicates the distinction seen in the literature between blockchain as currency and blockchain as media and points to the increasing need to study non-currency-based blockchain technologies.","[Brody, Ann] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Couture, Stephane] Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada","McGill University; Universite de Montreal","Brody, A (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.","ann.brody@mail.mcgill.ca; stephane.couture@umontreal.ca","","","","","","","56","0","0","1","2","CANADIAN JOURNAL COMMUNICATION","VANCOUVER","C/O SIMON FRASER UNIV, 515 WEST HASTINGS ST, VANCOUVER, BC V6B 5K3, CANADA","0705-3657","1499-6642","","CAN J COMMUN","Can.

"J","Yang, YC","","","","Yang, Yanchao","","","On the Legal Attributes of Digital Currency","SOCIAL SCIENCES IN CHINA","","","English","Article","","","","","","digital currency; Bitcoin; legal attributes; regulatory system; financial regulation","","Digital currency has been widely used ever since the concept of Bitcoin was formulated. It uses blockchains as its underlying technical support and is characterized by decentralization, programmability, and security verification based on the principles of cryptology. Generally speaking, theories on the legal attributes of digital currency regard it either as nonmonetary property or as currency. The former theory can be subdivided into theories on digital currency as commodity, as securities or as data. All of these subdivisions present insurmountable theoretical difficulties and practical obstacles. If we return to the substantive nature of currency as a generally accepted accounting symbol, it can be seen that currency issuance by the state or a private bank is simply a means of building currency credit rather than a necessary condition. Unlike traditional currency, digital currency relies on blockchain technology to complete the construction of decentralized currency credit. This has resulted in a new theory of currency based on the theory of digital currency. On the one hand, it offers a jurisprudential foundation for the construction of the quasi-currency attributes of digital currency; on the other, it provides a theoretical basis for the gradual improvement of digital currency legislation. We can first determine the legal attributes of digital currency as a quasi-currency and then confirm its legal position when the time is ripe. We need to confirm the legal status of digital currency as a quasi-currency through legislation, and use this as a logical starting point for the construction of a series of legal systems for digital currency as a quasi-currency. Digital currency can easily be used as a tool for crime or for evading financial controls; therefore, we need to determine a regulatory body and formulate regulatory rules.","[Yang, Yanchao] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Law, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Social Sciences","Yang, YC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Law, Beijing, Peoples R China.","yangyanchao@cass.org.cn","","","","","","","51","0","0","18","49","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0252-9203","1940-5952","","SOC SCI CHINA","Soc.

The household chose which fractions of two currencies to hold, e.g., a national currency such as a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and a global currency such as Bitcoin or Facebook's Diem, and chose the tax evasion probability for each currency. The government chose, for each currency, the probability of detecting and prosecuting tax evasion, the tax rate, and the penalty factor imposed on the household when tax evasion was successfully detected and prosecuted. The household ' s fraction of the national currency, the government's monitoring probability of the national currency, and the penalty factor imposed on the global currency, increased in the household ' s Cobb Douglas output elasticity for the national currency. The household ' s probabilities of tax evasion on both currencies increased in the government's Cobb Douglas output elasticity for the national currency. The government's taxation on both currencies decreased in the output elasticity for the national currency. High output elasticity for the national currency eventually induced the government to tax that currency more than the global currency. The household ' s probability of tax evasion on the global currency increased in the government's output elasticity for that currency. The household was less (more) likely to tax evade on the national (global) currency if the government valued taxation and penalty on the national (global) currency. The results are illustrated numerically where each of the eight parameter values was varied relative to a benchmark.","[Wang, Guizhou; Hausken, Kjell] Univ Stavanger, Fac Sci & Technol, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway","Universitetet i Stavanger","Hausken, K (corresponding author), Univ Stavanger, Fac Sci & Technol, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.","pobewang@outlook.com; kjell.hausken@uis.no","","Hausken, Kjell/0000-0001-7319-3876; , Guizhou/0000-0001-5297-8105","","","","","38","2","2","1","13","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2073-4336","","GAMES-BASEL","Games","JUN","2021","12","2","","","","","","","34","10.3390/g12020034","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/g12020034","","","24","Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences","TA3FM","","Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000667135900001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We also employ the concept of Renyi transfer entropy that allows for capturing rare and frequent events separately as well as non-linear market dependencies, focusing on extreme (tail) observations of the return distributions. We find that Bitcoin and Ripple share a bidirectional information transmission, while there is only one directional information transmission from Ripple to Ethereum. There is no nonlinear information transmission according to the Renyi's measure, which implies the linear dependency among the three cryptocurrencies. This information transmission between cryptocurrencies occurs mostly in the pre-crash period while they become independent after the 2017 cryptocurrency crash.

Many applications focus on exploiting the Blockchain-native features (e.g. trust from consensus, and smart contracts) while paying less attention to the application-specific requirements. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study on the applications in the education and training sector, where Blockchain is leveraged to combat diploma fraud. We first present a general system structure for digitized diploma management systems and identify both functional and non-functional requirements. We then show that all existing Blockchain-based systems fall short in meeting these requirements. Inspired by the analysis, we propose a Blockchain-facilitated solution by leveraging some basic cryptographic primitives and data structures. Our analysis shows that the proposed solution respects all the identified requirements by design and can be further extended to enhance its security and privacy guarantees. Finally, we investigate the proposed solution's computational complexity and demonstrate its practicality.","[Tang, Qiang] Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol, L-4362 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg","Luxembourg Institute of Science & Technology","Tang, Q (corresponding author), Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol, L-4362 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.","qiang.tang@list.lu","","","","","","","25","2","2","2","5","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2021","9","","","","","","168678","168688","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3137901","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3137901","","","11","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","XY1GP","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000736730300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

While the new generation of blockchain applications is still evolving, blockchain's technical characteristics are also advancing. Yet, immutability, a hitherto indisputable and highly advertised property according to which blockchain data cannot be edited nor deleted, remains the cornerstone of blockchain's security. Nevertheless, blockchain's immutability is being called into question lately in the light of the new erasing requirements imposed by the GDPR's Right to be Forgotten (RtbF) provision. As the RtbF obliges blockchain data to be editable in order restricted content redactions, modifications or deletions to be applied when requested, blockchains compliance with the regulation is indeed challenging, if not impracticable. Towards resolving this contradiction, various methods and techniques for mutable blockchains have been proposed to satisfy regulatory erasing requirements while preserving blockchains' security. To this end, this work aims to provide a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art research approaches, technical workarounds and advanced cryptographic techniques that have been put forward to resolve this conflict and to discuss their potentials, constraints and limitations when applied in the wild to either permissioned or permissionless blockchains.","[Politou, Eugenia; Casino, Fran; Alepis, Efthimios; Patsakis, Constantinos] Univ Piraeus, Dept Informat, Piraeus 18534, Greece; [Patsakis, Constantinos] Athena Res Ctr, Informat Management Syst Inst, Maroussi 15125, Greece","University of Piraeus","Patsakis, C (corresponding author), Univ Piraeus, Dept Informat, Piraeus 18534, Greece.","kpatsak@gmail.com","","Patsakis, Constantinos/0000-0002-4460-9331; Casino, Fran/0000-0003-4296-2876; Politou, Eugenia/0000-0001-6157-6490","European Commission under the Horizon 2020 Programme (H2020), project CyberSec4Europe [830929]; European Commission under the Horizon 2020 Programme (H2020), as part of the project LOCARD [832735]","European Commission under the Horizon 2020 Programme (H2020), project CyberSec4Europe; European Commission under the Horizon 2020 Programme (H2020), as part of the project LOCARD","This work was supported by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 Programme (H2020), as part of the projects CyberSec4Europe (Grant Agreement no. 830929) and LOCARD (Grant Agreement no. 832735).

The study tests the presence of regime changes in the GARCH volatility dynamics of the G7 stock indexes, Bitcoin, Gold, and energy assets (energy index, oil, and gas) by using the Markov-Switching GARCH model. It estimates the dynamic correlation and volatility spillover between energy and financial assets, by using the multivariate MSGARCH models. The estimation results of the Markov-Switching-BEKK-GARCH prove the volatility spillover from energy assets to financial assets. For the high regime, the results indicate a high level of dynamic correlation between energy assets and stock indexes which proves the contagion effect of the COVID-19. On the contrary, the dynamic conditional correlation between energy assets and Gold prices decreased during the COVID-19 crisis. This paper makes an original contribution in identifying the contagion between energy and financial assets and indicates that Gold is a safe haven for all energy and financial assets during the COVID-19 crisis. However, Bitcoin cannot be considered as a safe haven during the COVID-19 pandemic when investing in energy assets (crude oil and gas).","[Ghorbel, Achraf] Univ Sfax, Fac Econ & Management, St Airport,Km 4-5,LP 1088, Sfax 3018, Tunisia; [Jeribi, Ahmed] Univ Monastir, Fac Econ & Management Mahdia, Monastir, Tunisia","Universite de Monastir; Universite de Sfax; Universite de Monastir","Ghorbel, A (corresponding author), Univ Sfax, Fac Econ & Management, St Airport,Km 4-5,LP 1088, Sfax 3018, Tunisia.","ghorbelachraf@yahoo.fr","jeribi, ahmed/AAG-8273-2021","Ghorbel, Achraf/0000-0001-6303-5612; jeribi, ahmed/0000-0003-3029-1585","","","","","41","2","2","6","15","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","1309-422X","2147-429X","","EURASIAN ECON REV","Eurasian Econ.

They have concentrated on the prediction of return and risk rates of the financial product. So, an automated tool to predict the return rate of bitcoin is needed for financial products. The recently designed machine learning and deep learning models pave the way for the return rate prediction process. In this aspect, this study develops an intelligent return rate predictive approach using deep learning for blockchain financial products (RRP-DLBFP). The proposed RRP-DLBFP technique involves designing a long short-term memory (LSTM) model for the predictive analysis of return rate. In addition, Adam optimizer is applied to optimally adjust the LSTM model's hyperparameters, consequently increasing the predictive performance. The learning rate of the LSTM model is adjusted using the oppositional glowworm swarm optimization (OGSO) algorithm. The design of the OGSO algorithm to optimize the LSTM hyperparameters for bitcoin return rate prediction shows the novelty of the work. To ensure the supreme performance of the RRP-DLBFP technique, the Ethereum (ETH) return rate is chosen as the target, and the simulation results are investigated in different measures. The simulation outcomes highlighted the supremacy of the RRP-DLBFP technique over the current state of art techniques in terms of diverse evaluation parameters. For the MSE, the proposed RRP-DLBFP has 0.0435 and 0.0655 compared to an average of 0.6139 and 0.723 for compared methods in training and testing, respectively.","[Metawa, Noura] Univ Sharjah, Coll Business Adm, POB 27272, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Metawa, Noura] Mansoura Univ, Fac Commerce, Mansoura 35516, Egypt; [Alghamdi, Mohamemd I.] Al Baha Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Al Bahah 1988, Saudi Arabia; [El-Hasnony, Ibrahim M.; Elhoseny, Mohamed] Mansoura Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Mansoura 35516, Egypt","University of Sharjah; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Mansoura University; Al Baha University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Mansoura University","Elhoseny, M (corresponding author), Mansoura Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Mansoura 35516, Egypt.","nmetawa@sharjah.ac.ae; mialmushilah@bu.edu.sa; ibrahimhesin2005@mans.edu.eg; melhoseny@ieee.org","Elhoseny, Mohamed/Q-5591-2017; Al-Ghamdi, Mohammed Ibrahim/I-3651-2018","Elhoseny, Mohamed/0000-0001-6347-8368; Al-Ghamdi, Mohammed Ibrahim/0000-0002-9794-554X","","","","","43","2","2","4","10","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2071-1050","","SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL","Sustainability","NOV","2021","13","21","","","","","","","11901","10.3390/su132111901","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132111901","","","16","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","XJ6LO","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000726897100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, cryptocurrency adoption for micropayments has been limited due to slow confirmation of transactions and unforeseeable high fees, especially in the case of Bitcoin. To this end, creating off-chain payment channels between users is proposed which enables instant and nearly free transactions without writing to blockchain. Off-chain channel idea is then extended to establish payment channel networks to scale the idea to allow payment routing among many users. However, due to the way these channels are designed, both sides of a channel have a fixed one-way capacity for making transactions. Consequently, if one side consumes the whole one-way capacity, the channel becomes non-transitive in that particular direction, which causes failures of payments that would like to pass through. Eventually, the network becomes partitioned with unevenly distributed funds. In this paper, we propose the adoption of three specific techniques that aim to increase the overall success rate of payments and address channel imbalance problem to keep the payment channel network sustainable in the long run. First, we show the effectiveness of balance-aware routing that better utilizes available funds in the channels. Second, we propose an efficient method for selection of the gateway (i.e., connection point) for a user by considering the gateway?s inbound and outbound capacity. It exploits the fact that end-users can connect the network through multiple gateways any of which can be used to initiate the payment. Finally, we propose proportional payment splitting method to further increase success rate especially for large transactions. We implemented the three approaches for assessing their effectiveness. Compared to existing approaches such as maximum flow or greedy, the proposed approaches can achieve much higher success rates with channels balanced better.","[Mercan, Suat; Akkaya, Kemal] Florida Int Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Miami, FL 33174 USA; [Erdin, Enes] Univ Cent Arkansas, Dept Comp Sci, Conway, AR 72035 USA","State University System of Florida; Florida International University; University of Central Arkansas","Mercan, S (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Miami, FL 33174 USA.","smercan@fiu.edu","Erdin, Enes/AAZ-4970-2021","Erdin, Enes/0000-0003-2979-8143","","","","","27","3","3","2","14","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0140-3664","1873-703X","","COMPUT COMMUN","Comput.

To address these challenges, we propose a modular version of PoS-based blockchain systems called e-PoS that resists the centralization of network resources by extending mining opportunities to a wider set of stakeholders. Moreover, e-PoS leverages the in-built system operations to promote fair mining practices by penalizing malicious entities.

This delegation is known as the decentralization of controlling power and is a powerful security mechanism for the ecosystem. After the introduction of Bitcoin, the field of cryptocurrency has seen widespread attention from industry and academia, so much so that the original novel contribution of Bitcoin, i.e., decentralization, may be overlooked, due to decentralizations' assumed fundamental existence for the functioning of such crypto-assets. However, recent studies have observed a trend of increased centralization in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. As this increased centralization has an impact the security of the blockchain, it is crucial that it is measured, towards adequate control. This research derives an initial taxonomy of centralization present in decentralized blockchains through rigorous synthesis using a systematic literature review. This is followed by iterative refinement through expert interviews. We systematically analyzed 89 research papers published between 2009 and 2019. Our study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by highlighting the multiple definitions and measurements of centralization in the literature. We identify different aspects of centralization and propose an encompassing taxonomy of centralization concerns. This taxonomy is based on empirically observable and measurable characteristics. It consists of 13 aspects of centralization, classified over six architectural layers: Governance, Network, Consensus, Incentive, Operational, and Application. We also discuss how the implications of centralization can vary depending on the aspects studied.

The network is secured by miners who are nowadays organized in mining pools. In this paper, we consider the block withholding attack as introduced by Eyal, where mining pools may infiltrate others to decrease their revenues. However, when two mining pools attack each other and neither controls a strict majority, the so-called miner's dilemma arises. Both pools are worse off than without an attack. Knowing this, pools may make implicit non-attack agreements. Having said this, the miner's dilemma is known to emerge only if no pool controls the majority of the mining power. In this work, we extend the original model to include miner migration and show that the miner's dilemma emerges even for pools whose mining power exceeds 50%. We construct a game, where two mining pools attack each other and use simulation analysis methods to analyze the evolution the pools' mining power, infiltration preferences and revenue densities under the influence of different mining pool sizes and miner migration preferences. The results show that underlying game experiences a phase transition fueled by miners' migration preference. Without migration, it is profitable for a large mining pool to attack the other pool. The higher the migration preference of the miners, the more the game transitions into the miner's dilemma and attacking makes both pools worse off. Once the pools violate their implicit non-attack agreements, their revenues decrease.","[Li, Chuanyun] Harbin Engn Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Spychiger, Florian; Tessone, Claudio J.] Univ Zurich, UZH Blockchain Ctr, Zurich, Switzerland","Harbin Engineering University; University of Zurich","Li, CAY (corresponding author), Harbin Engn Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Harbin, Peoples R China.","lichuanyun123@hrbeu.edn.cn; florian.spychiger@uzh.ch; claudio.tessone@business.uzh.ch","","Spychiger, Florian/0000-0001-6602-8450; Tessone, Claudio J./0000-0001-7733-6221","Graduate School of Harbin Engineering University; UZH through the URPP Social Networks","Graduate School of Harbin Engineering University; UZH through the URPP Social Networks","CL acknowledges the support from the Graduate School of Harbin Engineering University that enabled a research stay at UZH.

Cryptocurrencies proliferated among like-minded individuals, generally depicted by scholars as anarcho-capitalists. Much social science literature has focused on governance and technical puzzles that these new market tools bring about as well as on the risks associated with the problems of trust, security, money laundering and illegal financing. In this article, I shift gaze to center on the material underpinnings of cryptocurrencies, such as energy systems and infrastructure, as well as how cryptocurrencies can expand in contexts of crisis in peripheral societies. I focus on the case of Venezuela to explain some of these processes in the rise and expansion of cryptocurrency markets that have remained at the margins of energy and political economy discussions. A deep dive into Venezuela allows us to devirtualize our understandings of cryptocurrencies. It redirects our attention to infrastructure, energy, rent, and precarious conditions of living in a crumbling rentier society, shedding light on the use and expansion of cryptocurrencies in a nominally socialist country.","[Rosales, Antulio] Univ New Brunswick, Dept Polit Sci, Fredericton, NB, Canada","University of New Brunswick","Rosales, A (corresponding author), Univ New Brunswick, Dept Polit Sci, Fredericton, NB, Canada.","arosales@unb.ca","","","","","","","70","6","6","3","12","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","2214-6296","2214-6326","","ENERGY RES SOC SCI","Energy Res.

Up to now, most research schemes improve efficiency by reducing reverse operations, but they fail to attach importance to such issues as forgery signature attack. At the same time, in the blockchain, the weak randomness of ECDSA will lead to the attack of forging random numbers, which is a potential problem of digital currency transactions. In consideration of this reason, in this article, an improved provably secure elliptic curve digital signature scheme is constructed. First, the new scheme introduces double parameters in the signature process, that can effectively resist the weak randomness attack of ECDSA in Bitcoin, and can be applied to blockchain digital currency trading systems. Second, in the random oracle model, it is provably indistinguishable against Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) under the super type I and type II adversary. Third, the new scheme avoids the inverse operation in the signature and verification phase. Compared with the ECDSA, the running speed is optimized by 50.1%. Similarly, the proposed scheme has higher computational efficiency than other existing algorithms.","[Liu, Shuang-Gen; Chen, Wan-Qi; Liu, Jia-Lu] Xian Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Cyberspace Secur, Xian 710121, Peoples R China","Xi'an University of Posts & Telecommunications","Liu, SG (corresponding author), Xian Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Cyberspace Secur, Xian 710121, Peoples R China.","liusgxupt@163.com","","Liu, ShuangGen/0000-0002-8188-2820","","","","","30","1","1","9","22","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2021","9","","","","","","77058","77066","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3082704","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3082704","","","9","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","TJ8XM","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000673757300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Security, bitcoin and decentralization were the categories located in the central nucleus of the social representation of Blockchain, while innovation, data, network, cryptocurrency, and technology were the categories located in the peripheral system. Based on the results obtained, there was a perceived strong association of Blockchain with bitcoin, one of its applications, and a dissonance between the existing academic literature and the perception of Brazilian professionals about the concept of Blockchain, as the latter is a privilege of the technical and operational issues of Blockchain to the detriment of its strategic potential. This dissonance can cause Blockchain initiatives to have results below expectations.

Due to the special structure of the blockchain, it has been deemed impossible to directly trade between traditional currencies and cryptocurrencies or between different types of cryptocurrencies. Generally, trading between different currencies is conducted through a centralized third-party platform. However, it has the problem of a single point of failure, which is vulnerable to attacks and thus affects the security of the transactions. In this paper, we propose a distributed cryptocurrency trading scheme to solve the problem of centralized exchanges, which can achieve secure trading between different types of cryptocurrencies. Our scheme is implemented with smart contracts on an Ethereum blockchain and deployed on an Ethereum test network. In addition to implementing transactions between individual users, our scheme also allows transactions among multiple users. The experimental result proves that the cost of our scheme is acceptable.","[Tian, Hangyu] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Elect Engn & Informat Sci, Hefei 230027, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Xue, Kaiping; Luo, Xinyi] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Cyber Secur, Hefei 230027, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Li, Shaohua] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Xu, Jie] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jianqing] Univ Alabama Huntsville, Dept Elect & Comp Engn ing, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA; [Zhao, Jun] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Wei, David S.

Whereas some cryptocurrency markets show evidence of herding, or, 'trend chasing', behaviors, in other markets we show evidence of contrarian-type behaviors. These findings are important because they elucidate upon, firstly, what forces drive cryptocurrency markets and, secondly, how this type of trading behavior affects autocorrelation patters for cryptocurrencies.

Our results highlight that Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ripple are the dominant transmitters to return spillover. The strongest interconnection is found for Bitcoin/Litecoin and Ripple/Sellar pair. Interestingly, Ethereum is the unvarying recipient in the system and is influenced by most of the cryptocurrencies. Further, NEM exhibits no connection with any of the cryptocurrency in the network acting as a potential diversifier. The quantile spillovers suggest increased intensity of connectedness at right and left tails. The sub-sample analysis confirms the low network integration across the cryptocurrencies during pre-COVID period.

This open nature of the transactional ledger allows us to gain macroeconomic insight into the USD 1 Trillion crypto economy. In this paper, we explore the free market-based economy of eight major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Litecoin, ZCash, Dogecoin, and Ethereum Classic. We specifically focus on the aspect of wealth distribution within these cryptocurrencies as understanding wealth concentration allows us to highlight potential information security implications associated with wealth concentration. We also draw a parallel between the crypto economies and real-world economies. To adequately address these two points, we devise a generic econometric analysis schema for cryptocurrencies. Through this schema, we report on two primary econometric measures: Gini value and Nakamoto Index which report on wealth inequality and 51% wealth concentration respectively. Our analysis reports that, despite the heavy emphasis on decentralization in cryptocurrencies, the wealth distribution remains in-line with the real-world economies, with the exception of Dash. We also report that 3 of the observed cryptocurrencies (Dogecoin, ZCash, and Ethereum Classic) violate the honest majority assumption with less than 100 participants controlling over 51% wealth in the ecosystem, potentially indicating a security threat. This suggests that the free-market fundamentalism doctrine may be inadequate in countering wealth inequality within a crypto-economic context: Algorithmically driven free-market implementation of these cryptocurrencies may eventually lead to wealth inequality similar to those observed in real-world economies.","[Sai, Ashish Rajendra; Buckley, Jim] Univ Limerick, Lero, Tierney Bldg, Limerick, Ireland; [Le Gear, Andrew] Univ Limerick, Nexus Ctr, Horizon Fintex Ireland DAC, Limerick, Ireland","University of Limerick; University of Limerick","Sai, AR (corresponding author), Univ Limerick, Lero, Tierney Bldg, Limerick, Ireland.","17053145@studentmail.ul.ie","","","Science Foundation Ireland [13/RC/2094_P2]; European Regional Development Fund through Southern andamp; Eastern Regional Operational Programme","Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation IrelandEuropean Commission); European Regional Development Fund through Southern andamp; Eastern Regional Operational Programme","This work was supported, in part, by Science Foundation Ireland grant 13/RC/2094_P2 and co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund through the Southern andamp; Eastern Regional Operational Programme to Lero - the Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre for Software (www.lero.ie).","","81","0","0","2","6","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","2624-7852","","","FRONT BLOCKCHAIN","Front.

A total of 3159 blockchain-related articles published through August 5, 2019, were gathered from the Web of Science. In all, 2478 articles formed the citation network, 27 of which were on the key route. These 27 key papers on blockchain represented the four developmental stages. Stage 1 focused on challenges to bitcoin. Stage 2 focused on smart contract issues. Stage 3 focused on opportunities, challenges, and development in blockchain. Finally, Stage 4 focused on smart contract applications, especially in e-healthcare, where blockchain technology is paving the way to a quicker, more secure, and more efficient means of storing and accessing medical data. The Girvan-Newman clustering technique was used to classify articles, and keyword analysis was used to analyze the top six major themes. These were bitcoin security, bitcoin financial applications, e-healthcare, Ethereum smart contracts, security and privacy in IoT, and energy. Main path analysis was also used to analyze their developmental trends. The results have significant value for both academics and practitioners.","[Tseng, Fang-Mei; Gil, Eunice Ina N.

Using a large dataset of approximately 25 million tweets about 23 of the largest cryptocurrencies, I show that investor attention, as proxied by the number of tweets, retweets, and favorites, corresponds to greater cryptocurrency price volatility. I use a Vector Autoregression (VAR) framework to show that investor attention predicts future price volatility. Additionally, days on which investors are distracted because of attention-grabbing events correspond to lower price volatility in cryptocurrency markets. The results suggest that increased investor attention to cryptocurrencies has the undesirable effect of increasing price volatility.","[Al Guindy, Mohamed] Carleton Univ, Sprott Sch Business, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Carleton University","Al Guindy, M (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Sprott Sch Business, Ottawa, ON, Canada.","mohamed.alguindy@carleton.ca","","Al Guindy, Mohamed/0000-0002-2395-4187","","","","","56","10","10","4","14","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1059-0560","1873-8036","","INT REV ECON FINANC","Int.

Specifically, trivariate GARCH-BEKK models are estimated which include suitably defined dummies corresponding to different types, targets and number per day of cyber-attacks. Significant dynamic linkages (interdependence) between the three cryptocurrencies under investigation are found in most cases when cyber-attacks are taken into account, Bitcoin appearing to be the dominant cryptocurrency. Further, Wald tests for parameter shifts during episodes of turbulence resulting from cyber-attacks provide evidence that the latter affect the transmission mechanism between cryptocurrency returns and volatilities (contagion). More precisely, cyber-attacks appear to strengthen cross-market linkages, thereby reducing portfolio diversification opportunities for cryptocurrency investors.

The results show that the dynamic conditional correlations between cryptocurrencies and equity in Vietnam increased during the pandemic, however, in most periods, positive dynamic correlations often dominate. Besides, the regression results also indicate that Bitcoin and Litecoin act as weak safe-haven investments for stocks in Vietnam during the COVID-19 turmoil. They are more suitable for diversification purposes although the dynamic correlations between them and the stock index in Vietnam vary stronger during the pandemic crisis than before. The findings of this study suggest that in the period of pandemic crisis, cryptocurrencies are not concerned as effective safe-haven assets for stock in Vietnam.

The corresponding software was implemented by SAS OPTMODEL Procedure. The paper deals with a portfolio of trade strategies built for highly-profitable, but also highly risky financial tools-cryptocurrencies. Available bitcoin assets were divided into a corresponding proportion for each of the recommended portfolio strategies, and during the selected period (one calendar month) were used for this research. The portfolio of trade strategies is rebuilt at the end of the period (every month) based on the results of trade during the period, in accordance with the conditions of risk minimizing or income maximizing. Trading strategies work in parallel, being in a state of waiting for a relevant trading signal. Strategies can be changed by moving the parameters in accordance with the current state of the financial market, removed if ineffective, and replaced where necessary. The efficiency of using a robust decision-making method in the context of uncertainty regarding cryptocurrency trading was confirmed by the results of real trading for the Bitcoin/Dollar pair.

This paper simulates the Bitcoin blockchain network traffic in a realistic setting and studies the impacts of both logical and physical network structure on the traffic redundancy. Firstly, we construct an Internet AS layer topology graph and map the Bitcoin nodes to the ASes. Then, Bitcoin 's neighbor discovery algorithm is used to connect Bitcoin nodes together logically. Finally, we simulate the Internet traffic generated by Bitcoin 's flood-based broadcast algorithm in the AS layer topology graph. Specifically, the traffic that a message generates is calculated by the number of ASes a message passes through times the message size. The difference between the total and effective traffic (i.e., the theoretical minimum) is considered traffic redundancy. Simulations show that traffic redundancy is positively correlated with the Bitcoin network scale and the number of peer neighbors for each node. Meanwhile, the underlying physical network topology, especially the average routing path length between the Bitcoin nodes, determines the traffic redundancy as well. Our findings imply that one can optimize the blockchain network's throughput by altering the underlying physical network, e.g., migrating from the Internet to a satellite environment.","[Zhang, Ying-Hao] Southeast Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiao Fan] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Media & Commun, Web Min Lab, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Southeast University - China; City University of Hong Kong","Zhang, YH (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China.","","Liu, Xiao Fan/I-6403-2015","Liu, Xiao Fan/0000-0001-8342-4623","","","","","13","1","1","1","5","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","0271-4302","","978-1-7281-9201-7","IEEE INT SYMP CIRC S","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401386","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401386","","","5","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering","BS1WK","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000696765400329","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Using the time-varying deficiency measure, we show that the COVID-19 outbreak adversely affected the efficiency of the four cryptocurrencies, given a substantial increase in the levels of inefficiency during the COVID-19 period. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the hardest hit, and at the same time, these two largest cryptocurrencies recovered faster at the end of March 2020 from their sharp dip towards inefficiency. The findings confirm previous evidence that market efficiency is time varying; also, unprecedented catastrophic events, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, have adverse effects of on the efficiency of leading cryptocurrencies.

Thus, the cryptocurrencies market provides an opportunity for the potential benefits from portfolio diversification and hedging strategies. However, cointegration is found between cryptocurrencies and ASEAN-5 stock markets thus indicating limited portfolio diversification benefits in the long-run among these markets. In addition, the results also show that ASEAN-5 stock markets are going towards a greater integration among them which is in congruence with the previous studies. However, in the short-run, Granger causality tests show that Dash, Ethereum, Lite, Ripple and Stellar have no causality relationship with all ASEAN-5 stock markets and no causality is also found between Bitcoin and three of ASEAN-5 stock markets (Malaysia, Singapore and Philippines). Therefore, there still exists an opportunity for portfolio diversification between cryptocurrencies and ASEAN-5 stock markets in the short-run.

In this context, this paper implements the frequency connectedness approach of Barunik and Krehlik (2018) and to measure short-, medium- and long-term connectedness between realized volatilities of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, this paper analyzes network graphs of directional TO/FROM spillovers before and after the announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic by the World Health Organization. Design/methodology/approach In this study, we examine the volatility connectedness among eight major cryptocurrencies by the virtue of market capitalization by using the frequency connectedness approach over the period July 26, 2017 and October 28, 2020. To this end, this paper computes short-, medium- and long-cycle overall spillover indexes on different frequency bands. All indexes properly capture well-known events such as the 2018 cryptocurrency market crash and COVID-19 pandemic and markedly surge around these incidents. Furthermore, owing to notably increased volatilities after the official announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper concentrates on network connectedness of volatility spillovers for two distinct periods, July 26, 2017-March 10, 2020 and March 11, 2020-October 28, 2020, respectively. In line with the related studies, major cryptocurrencies stand at the epicenter of the connectedness network and directional volatility spillovers dramatically intensify based on the network analysis. Findings Overall spillover indexes have fluctuated between 54% and 92% in May 2018 and April 2020. The indexes gradually escalated till November 9, 2018 and surpassed their average values (71.92%, 73.66% and 74.23%, respectively). Overall spillover indexes dramatically plummeted till January 2019 and reached their troughs (54.04%, 57.81% and 57.81%, respectively). Etherium catalyst the highest sum of volatility spillovers to other cryptocurrencies (94.2%) and is followed by Litecoin (79.8%) and Bitcoin (76.4%) before the COVID-19 announcement, whereas Litecoin becomes the largest transmitter of total volatility (89.5%) and followed by Bitcoin (89.3%) and Etherium (88.9%). Except for Etherium, the magnitudes of total volatility spillovers from each cryptocurrency notably increase after - COVID-19 announcement period. The medium-cycle network topology of pairwise spillovers indicates that the largest transmitter of total volatility spillover is Litecoin (89.5%) and followed by Bitcoin (89.3%) and Etherium (88.9%) before the COVID-19 announcement. Etherium keeps its leading role of transmitting the highest sum of volatility spillovers (89.4%), followed by Bitcoin (88.9%) and Litecoin (88.2%) after the COVID-19 announcement. The largest transmitter of total volatility spillovers is Etherium (95.7%), followed by Litecoin (81.2%) and Binance Coin (75.5%) for the long-cycle connectedness network in the before-COVID-19 announcement period. These nodes keep their leading roles in propagating volatility spillover in the latter period with the following sum of spillovers (Etherium-89.5%, Bitcoin-88.9% and Litecoin-88.1%, respectively). Research limitations/implications The study can be extended by including more cryptocurrencies and high-frequency data. Originality/value The study is original and contributes to the extant literature threefold. First, this paper identifies connectedness between major cryptocurrencies on different frequency bands by using a novel methodology. Second, this paper estimates volatility connectedness between major cryptocurrencies before and after the announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic and thereby to concentrate on its impact on the cryptocurrency market. Third, this paper plots network graphs of volatility connectedness and herewith picture the intensification of cryptocurrencies due to a major financial distress event.","[Polat, Onur] Bilecik Seyh Edebali Univ, Dept Publ Finance, Bilecik, Turkey; [Kabakci Gunay, Eylul] Izmir Demokrasi Univ, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey","Bilecik Seyh Edebali University; Izmir Democracy University","Polat, O (corresponding author), Bilecik Seyh Edebali Univ, Dept Publ Finance, Bilecik, Turkey.","onur.polat@bilecik.edu.tr; ekabakci87@gmail.com","Polat, Onur/Q-7985-2018","Polat, Onur/0000-0002-7170-4254","","","","","76","4","4","3","14","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1086-7376","1755-6791","","STUD ECON FINANC","Stud.

There have been proposed various methods to realize the requirements. Some of them require anonymous communication paths as necessary elements to satisfy the anonymity requirement for a practical electronic voting system. Cruz et al. proposed an electronic voting system that does not need anonymous communication paths, using Bitcoin, a cryptographic currency, as a distributed database. However, Bitcoin is a system in which all data are disclosed, and anyone can check what exchanges a person of a certain ID (Bitcoin address) has done. It is possible to reveal which voter made what vote, and hence(anonymity is not satisfied. In this paper, we propose a method to solve the above problem by using Bitcoin mixing. We propose an electronic voting system using Zerocoin, a variant of Bitcoin, as a database, in which zero knowledge proof is used instead of blind signature for mixing.","[Takabatake, Yu] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Informat, Kyoto, Japan; [Okabe, Yasuo] Kyoto Univ, Acad Ctr Comp & Media Studies, Kyoto, Japan","Kyoto University; Kyoto University","Takabatake, Y (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Informat, Kyoto, Japan.","takabatake@net.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp","","","","","","","21","1","1","0","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-9101-0","","","","2021","","","","","","","163","168","","10.1109/ICOIN50884.2021.9333937","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICOIN50884.2021.9333937","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BR5XX","","Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000657974100029","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Our results suggest that the equicorrelations are time-varying and highly responsive to major events, such as hacker attacks and government bans. The results lend support to the recent claim that interlinkages among cryptocurrencies have become stronger, particularly after mid-2017, with substantially increased trading activity in the market. The equicorrelations reach their peak in March 2020, after the official declaration of the World Health Organization (WHO) that novel coronavirus outbreak becomes a global pandemic, indicating potential contagion effects. We also examine the determinants of the market linkages and find that increased Bitcoin trading volume, attention-driven demand for Bitcoin and risk aversion significantly increase the equicorrelations during the COVID-19 bear market. Our results provide potential implications for investors, traders and policy makers and help improve their understanding of the cryptocurrency market's behavior during times of extreme market stress.

However, the development and implementation of RES entail various challenges, e.g., dealing with grid stability issues due to RES' intermittency. Correspondingly, increasingly volatile and even negative electricity prices question the economic viability of RES-plants. To address these challenges, this paper analyzes how the integration of an RES-plant and a computationally intensive, energy-consuming data center (DC) can promote investments in RES-plants. An optimization model is developed that calculates the net present value (NPV) of an integrated energy system (IES) comprising an RES-plant and a DC, where the DC may directly consume electricity from the RES-plant. To gain applicable knowledge, this paper evaluates the developed model by means of two use-cases with real-world data, namely AWS computing instances for training Machine Learning algorithms and Bitcoin mining as relevant DC applications. The results illustrate that for both cases the NPV of the IES compared to a stand-alone RES-plant increases, which may lead to a promotion of RES-plants. The evaluation also finds that the IES may be able to provide significant energy flexibility that can be used to stabilize the electricity grid. Finally, the IES may also help to reduce the carbon-footprint of new energy-intensive DC applications by directly consuming electricity from RES-plants.","[Fridgen, Gilbert] Univ Luxembourg, SnT Interdisciplinary Ctr Secur Reliabil & Trust, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Fridgen, Gilbert; Koerner, Marc-Fabian; Weibelzahl, Martin] Project Grp Business & Informat Syst Engn Fraunho, Bayreuth, Germany; [Koerner, Marc-Fabian; Weibelzahl, Martin] Univ Bayreuth, FIM Res Ctr, Bayreuth, Germany; [Walters, Steffen] Univ Augsburg, FIM Res Ctr, Augsburg, Germany","University of Luxembourg; University of Bayreuth; University of Augsburg","Korner, MF (corresponding author), Project Grp Business & Informat Syst Engn Fraunho, Bayreuth, Germany.;Korner, MF (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, FIM Res Ctr, Bayreuth, Germany.","marc.koerner@fim-rc.de","","Fridgen, Gilbert/0000-0001-7037-4807; Korner, Marc-Fabian/0000-0002-0724-2673","Projekt DEAL","Projekt DEAL","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.","","81","2","2","3","13","SPRINGER VIEWEG-SPRINGER FACHMEDIEN WIESBADEN GMBH","WIESBADEN","ABRAHAM-LINCOLN STASSE 46, WIESBADEN, 65189, GERMANY","2363-7005","1867-0202","","BUS INFORM SYST ENG+","Bus.

There is strong evidence of explosive periods in cryptocurrency prices expressed in US Dollars, but also when XRP and Ether are expressed in Bitcoin. Whether or not these explosive periods can be interpreted as cryptocurrency bubbles requires a sufficient understanding of the fundamental value of cryptocurrencies.

A representative example is the Bitcoin ledger. Indeed, since Bitcoin-and more generally blockchain ledgers-are known to be useful in various scenarios, it has become increasingly popular to capture such ledgers as global setup. Intuitively, one would expect UC to allow us to make security statements about protocols that use such a global setup, e.g., a global ledger, which can then be automatically translated into the setting where the setup is replaced by a protocol implementing it, such as Bitcoin. We show that the above reasoning is flawed and such a generic security-preserving replacement can only work under very (often unrealistic) strong conditions on the global setup and the security statement. For example, the UC security of Bitcoin for realizing a ledger proved by Badertscher et al. [CRYPTO'17] is not sufficient per se to allow us to replace the ledger by Bitcoin when used as a global setup. In particular, we cannot expect that all security statements in the global ledger-hybrid world would be preserved when using Bitcoin as a ledger. On the positive side, we provide characterizations of security statements for protocols that make use of global setups, for which the replacement is sound. Our results can be seen as a first guide on how to navigate the very tricky question of what constitutes a good global setup and how to use it in order to keep the modular protocol-design approach intact.","[Badertscher, Christian] IOHK, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hesse, Julia] IBM Res Europe, Zurich, Switzerland; [Zikas, Vassilis] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus","Badertscher, C (corresponding author), IOHK, Zurich, Switzerland.","christian.badertscher@iohk.io; jhs@zurich.ibm.com; vzikas@cs.purdue.edu","","","Sunday Group; NSF [2055599]","Sunday Group; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","V.

We, then, survey different researches based on the implementation of blockchain in IoT.

For this, we use two proxies, the FEARS index of Da et al. (2015) and Twitter Happiness sentiment, applying the bivariate cross-quantilogram of Han et al. (2016). Happiness sentiment index significantly predicts Bitcoin return as well as other major cryptocurrencies at the two extreme states of the market and for extreme levels of sentiment. Hence, investors should readjust their portfolios according to the market sentiment and limit their decision on the safe-haven property of Bitcoin. As to FEARS, predictability also exists but is rather pronounced for a low level of sentiment. Overall, Happiness sentiment reveals to be a persistent and robust predictor for most cryptocurrency returns. FEARS index also shows significant predictability of returns, but the predictability is weaker and mainly in the short-term. In summary, our findings provide evidence that online investor sentiment is a significant nonlinear predictor for most major cryptocurrencies returns, suggesting though the superiority of Twitter to Google-based online investor sentiment proxy. Moreover, cryptocurrency returns seem to be driven more by sentiment transmitted through social media than with macroeconomic news, which is in line with the nature of cryp-tocurrency participants, mainly young individuals computer enthusiasts.","[Naeem, Muhammad Abubakr] Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Auckland, New Zealand; [Naeem, Muhammad Abubakr] Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Coll Business, Dublin, Ireland; [Mbarki, Imen] Univ Tunis, Inst Super Gest Tunis, Finance Appl & Audit Lab, Gouvernance Entreprise, Tunis, Tunisia; [Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain] Univ Montpellier, Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier Res Management, Montpellier, France; [Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain] South Ural State Univ, Chelyabinsk, Russia","Massey University; University College Dublin; Universite de la Manouba; Universite de Tunis; Montpellier Business School; Universite de Montpellier; South Ural State University","Shahzad, SJH (corresponding author), Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France.","m.naeem@massey.ac.nz; imenmbarki@yahoo.com; j.syed@montpellier-bs.com","Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain/D-1986-2019; Naeem, Muhammad Abubakr/HCH-3576-2022","Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain/0000-0003-3511-6057; Naeem, Muhammad Abubakr/0000-0001-6962-3175","Science Foundation Ireland [16/SPP/3347]","Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation IrelandEuropean Commission)","Muhammad Abubakr Naeem gratefully acknowledges the support of Science Foundation Ireland under grant number 16/SPP/3347.","","53","20","20","7","54","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1059-0560","1873-8036","","INT REV ECON FINANC","Int.

One example is the applicability of blockchain systems to provide security and privacy of IoT networks, which is the topic of this article. Blockchain systems are on the rise, as crypto-currency payment systems (such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc.) boomed in the last few years due to their attractive de-centralized and anonymous features. As in every transaction, access of the users to IoT systems needs to be controlled. However, these systems are peer-to-peer systems and do not have centralized control, which means that traditional access control techniques will not be optimal. As a result, distributed access control schemes are needed and this paper aims at providing the state of the art in the literature. Thereby, we introduce and discuss the details and applicability of centralized (role-based) and distributed (threshold-signature, reputation, trusted-computing, identity, capability, ACL, group-signature, and hybrid) access control schemes to blockchain systems under the IoT ecosystems. Moreover, permissioned vs. permissionless blockchain systems are also discussed. Finally, challenges and research directions related to the application of all those presented blockchain systems to IoT are discussed.","[Butun, Ismail] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Comp Engn, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Butun, Ismail] Konya Food & Agr Univ, Dept Comp Engn, TR-42080 Konya, Turkey; [Osterberg, Patrik] Mid Sweden Univ, Dept Informat Syst & Technol, S-85170 Sundsvall, Sweden","Chalmers University of Technology; Konya Food & Agriculture University; Mid-Sweden University","Butun, I (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Comp Engn, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.;Butun, I (corresponding author), Konya Food & Agr Univ, Dept Comp Engn, TR-42080 Konya, Turkey.","ibutun@mail.usf.edu","Österberg, Patrik/AAH-5409-2019; Butun, Ismail/K-1246-2015","Österberg, Patrik/0000-0003-3433-2997; Butun, Ismail/0000-0002-1723-5741","Swedish Knowledge Foundation (KKS)","Swedish Knowledge Foundation (KKS)","This work was supported by the Swedish Knowledge Foundation (KKS) under grant research pro~le Nasta generations Industriella IoT (NIIT).","","65","8","9","7","35","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2021","9","","","","","","5428","5441","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3047902","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3047902","","","14","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","PS8WV","","Green Published, gold, Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000608205100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Here, we analyse 851,199 listings extracted from 30 DWMs between January 1, 2020 and November 16, 2020. We identify 788 listings directly related to COVID-19 products and monitor the temporal evolution of product categories including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), medicines (e.g., hydroxyclorochine), and medical frauds. Finally, we compare trends in their temporal evolution with variations in public attention, as measured by Twitter posts and Wikipedia page visits.

The COVID-19 crisis provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate this considerably further. Further, whether cryptocurrencies provide a diversification for equities is still an unsettled issue. We employ several econometric procedures, including wavelet coherence, and neural network analyses to rigorously examine the role of COVID-19 on the paired co-movements of four cryptocurrencies, with seven equity indices (matching countries particularly impacted by COVID-19). Our period of study includes one year prior to the onset of COVID-19, and one year during the pandemic, extending deeper into the pandemic period (February 2021) than most previous studies. We find co-movements between cryptocurrencies and equity indices gradually increased as COVID19 progressed. However, most of these co-movements are either modestly positively correlated, or minimal, suggesting cryptocurrencies in general do not provide a diversification benefit during either normal times or downturns. An exception, however, is the co-movement of tether. Tether co-moves negatively with equities to an economically significant degree, both pre COVID-19, and considerably more during COVID-19. Comovements between tether and equity indices spiked sharply during identified waves of the pandemic. Tether appears to be an important safe haven during times of market turmoil, consistent with investors seeking USD liquidity during periods of volatility.","[Goodell, John W.] Univ Akron, Dept Finance, Akron, OH USA; [Goutte, Stephane] Univ Paris Saclay, CEMOTEV, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Goutte, Stephane] Paris Sch Business, 59 Rue Nationale, F-75013 Paris, France","University System of Ohio; University of Akron; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay","Goodell, JW (corresponding author), Univ Akron, Dept Finance, Akron, OH USA.","johngoo@uakron.edu","","Goutte, Stephane/0000-0002-5206-866X; Goodell, John W./0000-0003-4126-9244","","","","","46","55","55","10","24","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1057-5219","1873-8079","","INT REV FINANC ANAL","Int.

The novelty of this newly emerged asset class has led researchers to gauge anomalous trade patterns and behavioural fallacies in the crypto market. Therefore, the present study aims to examine the herd behaviour in a newly evolved cryptocurrency market during normal, skewed, Bitcoin bubble and COVID-19 phases. It, then, investigates the significance of Bitcoin in driving herding bias in the market. Finally, the study gauges herding contagion between the crypto market and stock markets. Design/methodology/approach The study employs daily closing prices of cryptocurrencies and relevant stocks of S&P 500 (USA), S&P BSE Sensex (Index) and MERVAL (Argentina) indices for a period spanning from June 2015 to May 2020. Quantile regression specifications of Chang et al.'s (2000) absolute deviation method have been used to locate herding bias. Dummy regression models have also been deployed to examine herd activity during skewed, crises and COVID-19 phases. Findings The descriptive statistics reveal that the relevant distributions are leptokurtic, justifying the selection of quantile regression to diagnose tails for herding bias. The empirical results provide robust evidence of crypto herd activity during normal, bullish and high volatility periods. Next, the authors find that the assumptions of traditional financial doctrines hold during the Bitcoin bubble. Further, the study reveals that the recent outbreak of COVID-19 subjects the crypto market to herding activity at quantile (t) = 0.60. Finally, no contagion is observed between cryptocurrency and stock market herding. Practical implications Drawing on the empirical findings, it is believed that in this age of digitalization and technological escalation, this new asset class can offer diversification benefits to the investors. Also, the crypto market seems quite immune to behavioural idiosyncrasies during turbulence. This may relieve regulators of the possible instability this market may pose to the entire financial system. Originality/value The present study appears to be the first attempt to diagnose leptokurtic tails of relevant distribution for crypto herding in the wake of two remarkable events: the crypto asset bubble (2016-2017) and the outbreak of coronavirus (early 2020).","[Shrotryia, Vijay Kumar; Kalra, Himanshi] Univ Delhi, Fac Commerce & Business, Dept Commerce, Delhi Sch Econ, New Delhi, India","Delhi School of Economics; University of Delhi","Kalra, H (corresponding author), Univ Delhi, Fac Commerce & Business, Dept Commerce, Delhi Sch Econ, New Delhi, India.","kalra123.hk@gmail.com","Shrotryia, Vijay Kumar/ABF-4642-2021","","","","","","90","7","7","6","30","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1940-5979","1940-5987","","REV BEHAV FINANCE","Rev.

Despite many existing theories and studies on the fundamental motivations of the behavior of humans in financial systems, there is still limited empirical deduction of the behavioral compositions of the financial agents from a detailed market analysis. Blockchain technology has provided an avenue for the latter investigation with its voluminous data and its transparency of financial transactions. It has enabled us to perform empirical inference on the behavioral patterns of users in the market, which we explore in the bitcoin and ethereum cryptocurrency markets. In our study, we first determine various properties of the bitcoin and ethereum users by a temporal complex network analysis. After which, we develop methodology by combining k-means clustering and Support Vector Machines to derive behavioral types of users in the two cryptocurrency markets. Interestingly, we found four distinct strategies that are common in both markets: optimists, pessimists, positive traders and negative traders. The composition of user behavior is remarkably different between the bitcoin and ethereum market during periods of local price fluctuations and large systemic events. We observe that bitcoin (ethereum) users tend to take a short-term (long-term) view of the market during the local events. For the large systemic events, ethereum (bitcoin) users are found to consistently display a greater sense of pessimism (optimism) towards the future of the market.","[Aspembitova, Ayana T.; Chew, Lock Yue] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Phys & Appl Phys, Singapore, Singapore; [Aspembitova, Ayana T.; Feng, Ling] Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Inst High Performance Comp, Singapore, Singapore; [Feng, Ling] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Phys, Singapore, Singapore; [Chew, Lock Yue] Nanyang Technol Univ, Complex Inst, Singapore, Singapore; [Chew, Lock Yue] Nanyang Technol Univ, Data Sci & Artificial Intelligence Res Ctr, Singapore, Singapore","Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC); National University of Singapore; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University","Chew, LY (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Phys & Appl Phys, Singapore, Singapore.;Chew, LY (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Complex Inst, Singapore, Singapore.;Chew, LY (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Data Sci & Artificial Intelligence Res Ctr, Singapore, Singapore.","lockyue@ntu.edu.sg","","Aspembitova, Ayana/0000-0002-5418-1914; Chew, Lock Yue/0000-0003-1366-8205","","","","","45","4","4","2","18","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","JAN 12","2021","16","1","","","","","","","e0242600","10.1371/journal.pone.0242600","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242600","","","19","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","PV4SP","33434209","Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000609979700038","View Full Record in Web of Science"

When transaction fee dominates mining rewards, strategic deviations such as Selfish Mining, Undercutting, and Mining Gap could threaten the integrity and security of the Blockchain. In this paper, we propose a set of Dynamic Transaction Storage (DTS) strategies for maintaining a sustainable Blockchain under transaction-fee regime. Through the systematic simulation, we demonstrate that block incentive volatility can be reduced by applying DTS strategies, and thus avoid strategic deviations. With DTS, public Blockchains such as Bitcoin become sustainable when the mining reward is solely based on transaction fee.","[Zhao, Xiongfei; Si, Yain-Whar] Univ Macau, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Macau, Peoples R China","University of Macau","Zhao, XF (corresponding author), Univ Macau, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Macau, Peoples R China.","yb97480@um.edu.mo; fstasp@umac.mo","","","University of Macau [MYRG2019-00136-FST]","University of Macau","This research was funded by the University of Macau (File no.

While scholarly literature on blockchain has largely focused on bitcoin and cryptofinance, in recent years, a body of scholarship has started to emerge on blockchain in the public sector. The characteristics of blockchain have made it a promising technology to transform many activities related to public policy and public service provision, such as administrative processes, welfare provision and regulation practices. This article provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic literature review of the use of blockchain across all the main public services. This systematic review identifies the public services most likely to be impacted by the introduction of blockchain. It also highlights the main potential benefits, costs and risks of blockchain for government, civil servants and citizens. Governments are found to benefit mainly from improvements in efficiency and traceability, while regulatory uncertainty and questions around scalability represent major costs and risks for them. Civil servants, the least studied actor in the literature, could benefit from blockchain through the reduction of red tape and improvements in coordination between agencies. Their lack of blockchain knowledge and skills represent a major cost as regards adoption. Regarding citizens, security and transparency are identified as being the most important benefits, while risks are mainly associated with data security concerns. The article concludes by noting several limitations in the literature and providing suggestions towards fruitful lines of research.","[Cagigas, Diego; Clifton, Judith; Diaz-Fuentes, Daniel; Fernandez-Gutierrez, Marcos] Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Santander 39005, Spain","Universidad de Cantabria","Clifton, J (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Santander 39005, Spain.","judith.clifton@unican.es","Fernandez-Gutierrez, Marcos/K-6645-2014; Clifton, Judith/E-4462-2013; Diaz-Fuentes, Daniel/AIC-5526-2022; Fuentes, Daniel Diaz/K-8324-2014","Fernandez-Gutierrez, Marcos/0000-0002-4000-9283; Clifton, Judith/0000-0001-6081-6800; Diaz-Fuentes, Daniel/0000-0002-6290-2363; Fuentes, Daniel Diaz/0000-0002-6290-2363; Cagigas, Diego/0000-0002-4974-6335","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program through the project TOKEN [870603]","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program through the project TOKEN","This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program through the project TOKEN under Grant 870603.","","100","15","15","16","91","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2021","9","","","","","","13904","13921","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3052019","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3052019","","","18","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","QA1OS","","gold, Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000613219600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Central banks have stated that the use of crypto-assets remains modest in size and it does not pose a threat to financial stability, therefore they stayed unregulated in the EU. Following a big surge in the market capitalization of crypto-assets starting 2015, national authorities have decided to take action. While some member states have implemented a bespoke regime to cover crypto-assets, in other member states they remain unregulated. This paperwork's aim is to present a picture of the European context with regard to crypto-assets and the approach taken by member states in order to mitigate the risks related to crypto-assets. The information was collected from the available sources. The research was realized by using qualitative and thematic analysis. Throughout this paper, we will present the first attempts to introduce legislative solutions to regulate crypto-assets and create an EU framework that both enables markets in crypto-assets and the tokenization of traditional financial services.

However, in this untrusted environment a malicious full node could deliver altered or incomplete information, requiring query authentication techniques to ensure the integrity of the results. To this aim, we study an authentication mechanism for spatial information (i.e. data representing the location, size, and shape of objects in a geographical coordinate system). We assume that light nodes issue range queries to obtain data from a single block. To enable authentication, we propose to construct a Merkle R-tree for each block and embed its root into the corresponding header, so that full nodes can exploit it to fetch information and construct a proof of integrity for lightweight clients. We also develop a new algorithm based on sorting and partitioning for constructing Merkle R-trees from a set of spatial transactions and employ space-filling curves to preserve the locality of elements. We examine its theoretical complexity, evaluate it experimentally on a real data set and compare it against other popular construction strategies. Results show that, as queries become more selective, trees generated with our solution improve query performance and reduce verification times with respect to other approaches. Moreover, we observe that the overhead induced by the tree construction is negligible if compared to the average inter-block time of popular blockchain protocols such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.","[Loporchio, Matteo; Bernasconi, Anna; Maesa, Damiano Di Francesco; Ricci, Laura] Univ Pisa, Dept Comp Sci, I-56126 Pisa, Italy","University of Pisa","Loporchio, M (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Comp Sci, I-56126 Pisa, Italy.","matteo.loporchio@phd.unipi.it","; ricci, laura/Q-7651-2016","BERNASCONI, ANNA/0000-0003-0263-5221; Loporchio, Matteo/0000-0002-9806-6475; ricci, laura/0000-0002-8179-8215","","","","","30","0","0","1","3","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2021","9","","","","","","163363","163378","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3132990","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3132990","","","16","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","XP8UN","","Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000731135200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The sampled period extends from October 13(th) 2015 till November 18(th) 2019. The findings evidenced the superiority of the IGARCH model, in both the in-sample and the out-of-sample contexts, when it deals with forecasting the volatility of world currencies, namely the British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Swiss Franc and the Japanese Yen. The CGARCH alternative modeled the Euro almost perfectly during both periods. Advanced GARCH models better depicted asymmetries in cryptocurrencies' volatility and revealed persistence and intensifying levels in their volatility. The IGARCH was the best performing model for Monero. As for the remaining cryptocurrencies, the GJR-GARCH model proved to be superior during the in-sample period while the CGARCH and TGARCH specifications were the optimal ones in the out-of-sample interval. The VaR forecasting performance is enhanced with the use of the asymmetric GARCH models. The VaR results provided a very accurate measure in determining the level of downside risk exposing the selected exchange currencies at all confidence levels. However, the outcomes were far from being uniform for the selected cryptocurrencies: convincing for Dash and Dogcoin, acceptable for Litecoin and Monero and unconvincing for Bitcoin and Ripple, where the (optimal) model was not rejected only at the 99% confidence level.","[Naimy, Viviane; Haddad, Omar; El Khoury, Rim] Notre Dame Univ, Fac Business Adm & Econ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Zouk Mosbeh, Lebanon; [Fernandez-Aviles, Gema] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Law & Social Sci, Toledo, Spain","Notre Dame University Lebanon; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha","Fernandez-Aviles, G (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Law & Social Sci, Toledo, Spain.","Gema.faviles@uclm.es","El Khoury, Rim/K-6026-2019","El Khoury, Rim/0000-0003-4359-7591","University of Castilla-La Mancha (UCLM); European Regional Development Fund [2020GRIN-28948]","University of Castilla-La Mancha (UCLM); European Regional Development Fund(European Commission)","This research benefited from the cofunding by the University of Castilla-La Mancha (UCLM) and the European Regional Development Fund to the Research Group 2020 'Applied Economics and Quantitative Methods' (2020GRIN-28948).

Design/methodology/approach Empirically, the authors examine how WTI, Gold, VIX and five cryptocurrencies can be applicable to hedge the four stock markets. Three variants of multivariate GARCH models (DCC, ADCC and GO-GARCH) are implemented to estimate dynamic optimal hedge ratios. Findings The reached findings prove that both of the Bitcoin and Gold turn out to display remarkable hedging commodity features, while the other assets appear to demonstrate a rather noticeable disposition to act as diversifiers. Moreover, the results show that the VIX turns out to stand as the most effectively appropriate instrument, fit for hedging the stock market indices various related refits. Furthermore, the results prove that the hedging strategy instrument was indifferent for FTSE and NIKKEI stock while for the American and emerging markets, the hedging strategy was reversed from the pre-cryptocurrency crash to the during cryptocurrency crash period.

Our results confirm that demand shocks show the greatest connection with the returns of the cryptocurrencies analysed. In addition, both short-term and longterm results show a greater interdependence between oil and cryptocurrencies in periods of economic turbulence, such as the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus crisis.","[Jareno, Francisco; de la O Gonzalez, Maria; Lopez, Raquel; Rosa Ramos, Ana] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Albacete, Spain","Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha","Jareno, F (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Albacete, Spain.","fran.jareno@gmail.com; MariaO.Gonzalez@uclm.es; Raquel.Lopez@uclm.es; AnaRosa.Ramos@alu.uclm.es","Lopez, Raquel/E-5618-2017; Jareno, Francisco/L-7645-2014","Lopez, Raquel/0000-0001-7331-4455; Jareno, Francisco/0000-0001-9778-7345","Spanish Ministerio de Economia,Industria y Competitividad [ECO 2017-89715-P]","Spanish Ministerio de Economia,Industria y Competitividad(Spanish Government)","This work was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Economia,Industria y Competitividad (ECO 2017-89715-P).","","76","10","10","3","21","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0301-4207","1873-7641","","RESOUR POLICY","Resour.

In this sense, it can become addictive. The aim of this study is to develop a valid and reliable scale to measure Problematic Cryptocurrency Trading among individuals who trade cryptocurrency. Method: First, the theoretical framework of the study was discussed to lay a basis for the motives of this study. Then, with the help of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria and internet addiction scales, a 16-item scale was designed. The study was carried out on 2 different sample groups. The results were reported under the titles Study 1 and Study 2. The sample size of Study 1 was 1314. The data were collected through TrueFeedBack BlackStar, a survey platform that provides survey participation by awarding its participants with cryptocurrency. For this data set, item analyses, the t-test, reliability analysis, and the explanatory factor analysis were performed for 27% of the lower and upper groups. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test and Bartlett's test of sphericity to determine the suitability for the factor analysis, the principal component analysis for factorization, and the promax method for factor rotations were used. The SPSS Statistics 22 software package was used for the analyses. The sample size of Study 2 was 353. The data were collected from people known to be trading cryptocurrencies. The confirmatory factor analysis was performed for the model, the factor structure of which was determined in Study 1. For the goodness of fit of the model, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), incremental fit index (IFI), goodness of fit index (GFI), and chi-Square Test (chi(2)) goodness of fit criteria were used. The Amos 23 software package was used for the data analysis. Results: As a result of the exploratory factor analysis, a two-factor structure was obtained. For the total scores of the scale, Cronbach's alpha reliability value was found to be 0.913, and for the sub-factors, Cronbach's alpha values were found to be 0.897 and 0.866. The factor loadings of items varied between 0.786 and 0.597 for the first sub-factor and between 0.869 and 0.683 for the second sub-factor. The confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the two-factor structure of the scale, and the goodness of fit criteria were found to be at acceptable levels. Conclusion: It was determined that the Problematic Cryptocurrency Trading Scale is a valid and reliable scale.","[Mentes, Nurettin] Dicle Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, Diyarbakir, Turkey; [Yolbas, Ilyas] Dicle Univ, Dept Pediat, Sch Med, Publ Hlth, Diyarbakir, Turkey; [Bulut, Mahmut] Dicle Univ, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, Diyarbakir, Turkey","Dicle University; Dicle University; Dicle University","Bulut, M (corresponding author), Dicle Univ, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, Diyarbakir, Turkey.","drmahmutbulut@yahoo.com","","","","","","","40","0","0","3","13","AVES","SISLI","BUYUKDERE CAD 105-9, MECIDIYEKOY, SISLI, ISTANBUL 34394, TURKEY","2475-0573","2475-0581","","PSYCHIAT CLIN PSYCH","Psychiatry Clin.

In Bitcoin-like protocols, each block is always mined by all miners, which implies a design philosophy that all transactions should be protected with the highest security. As a result, the throughput is bounded in these protocols. In real-world applications, the security requirement of transactions differs. Therefore, we present B++, a scalable blockchain structure, which breaks the limits of blockchain security so that B++ can distribute system resources efficiently to confirm transactions with different requirements. In our analysis, we show that B++ inherits eventual consistency in Bitcoin-like protocols. Moreover, our open-source simulation indicates that the throughput of B++ can be more than 100 times greater than that of baseline approaches; besides, the number of timeout transactions in B++ can decrease by up to 70% than that in a Bitcoin-like blockchain.","[Jian, Ting-Han; Lin, Tsung-Nan] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chen, Bing-Jyue; Lin, Tsung-Nan] Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Commun Engn, Taipei, Taiwan","National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University","Chen, BJ (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Commun Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.","r08942078@ntu.edu.tw; b05901044@ntu.edu.tw; tsungnan@ntu.edu.tw","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C.

Furthermore, this study also quantifies the optimal portfolio weights and hedge ratios during both sample periods. The findings of study show that the return and volatility spillovers between the US stock and cryptocurrency markets are not significant during the pre-COVID-19 period. However, the study finds unidirectional return transmission from S&P 500 to all the cryptocurrencies during the COVID-19 period. During the COVID-19 period, the volatility spillover is unidirectional from S&P 500 to Litecoin, whereas the volatility transmissions are not significant for the pairs of S&P 500-Bitcoin and S&P 500-Ethereum. Based on optimal weights, the portfolio managers are recommended to slightly decrease their investments in S&P 500 for the portfolios of S&P 500/BTC, S&P 500/ETH and S&P 500/LTC during the COVID-19 period. Finally, during the COVID-19 period, all hedge ratios were found to be higher, implying higher hedging costs during the COVID-19 period compared to the pre-COVID-19 period.

Based upon this, this study proves that the price value forecast and price movement direction classification is both predictable. A recurrent neural networks based predictive model is built to regress and classify prices. With adaptive dynamic features selection and the use of external dependable factors with a potential degree of predictability, the proposed model achieves unprecedented performance in terms of movement classification.

We find that in most cases, the correlation between global financial assets and stock indexes is not significant or is weakly positive. From the perspective of investment horizons (frequency domain), the correlation in the short term is mostly manifested in Bitcoin, while in the medium and long term it is shifted to dollar assets. At the same time, the relationships are significantly higher in the medium and long term than in the short term. From the point of view of quantiles, it shows a weak positive correlation at the lower quantile. However, the correlation between the two is not significant at the median quantile. At the high quantiles, there is a weak negative linkage.

In 2008, Bitcoin opened the way for the creation of currencies accessible to the general public through the use of blockchain, but this technology has spread widely to an increasing variety of areas. Today there are a large number of crypto-currencies and, more generally, crypto-assets that are constantly increasing their number and market capitalization. Crypto-assets can produce positive economic and social effects (enhanced competition, a lowering of costs, financial inclusion, etc.) but may generate also serious concerns (money laundering, data protection, effectiveness of monetary policy, etc.). These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many crypto-assets are not covered by existing financial legislation and operate in a legal limbo. This work analyzes the Regulation proposal on Markets in Crypto-assets (COM (2020) 593) (MiCA) presented by the Commission on 24 September 2020 to fill this regulatory gap. This work demonstrates that MiCA reproduces concepts and standards already known in previous financial legislation with the necessary adaptations to the DLT environment. It offers constructive suggestions to improve the Commission's text and some thoughts on crypto-assets' implications for state sovereignty and an effective transmission of monetary policy. It submits that a coherent, mindful and explicit political decision on the future of monetary policy should precede the definitive MiCA Regulation to safeguard a very valuable public good: financial stability.","[Hinojosa Martinez, Luis M.] Univ Granada, Derecho Int Publ & Relac Int, Granada, Spain","University of Granada","Martinez, LMH (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Derecho Int Publ & Relac Int, Granada, Spain.","hinojosa@ugr.es","de Guereñu, Laura Martinez/K-2429-2012","Martinez de Guerenu Elorza, Laura/0000-0002-5948-5167","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [RTI2018-101041-B-I00]; FEDER-Junta de Andalucia [ASEJ-299-UGR18]","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities(Spanish Government); FEDER-Junta de Andalucia","The research for this article has been funded by research projects RTI2018-101041-B-I00, awarded by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, and ASEJ-299-UGR18, awarded by the FEDER-Junta de Andalucia.","","100","0","0","12","14","IUSTEL","MADRID","C PRINCESA NO 29, 2A DCHA, MADRID, 28008, SPAIN","1696-9634","","","REV GEN DERECHO EURO","Rev.

From the original Bitcoin cryptocurrency to the current smart contracts, the blockchain has been applied to many domains. Its numerous applications result in much ongoing research in different practical and scientific areas. This new technology is being seen as a revolutionary solution in finance, decentralization, trust, identity, data ownership and data-driven decisions. This paper presents the novel solutions associated with some of the big data areas that can be empowered by the blockchain technology such as healthcare, decentralized personal data protection, digital property, Internet of Things, digital identity, financial services and infrastructure, e-commerce, educational records, educational system, knowledge sharing, insurance, food industry, accounting, auditing and e-voting. Blockchain technology could be used in electronic health records and the establishment and maintenance of birth registers, deaths, marriages, registration of business activities, but also in the organization of elections. The features of this technology can be the redefinition of Internet 3.0 defined as a new type of decentralized infrastructure or network of networks.","[Mijoska, Mimoza; Ristevski, Blagoj] Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Fac Informat & Commun Technol Bitola, Bitola Partizanska Bb, Bitola 7000, North Macedonia","St. Clement of Ohrid University of Bitola","Mijoska, M (corresponding author), Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Fac Informat & Commun Technol Bitola, Bitola Partizanska Bb, Bitola 7000, North Macedonia.","mijoska.mimoza@uklo.edu.mk; blagoj.ristevski@uklo.edu.mk","","","","","","","45","1","1","6","8","SLOVENSKO DRUSTVO INFORMATIKA","LJUBLJANA","VOZARSKI POT 12, LJUBLJANA, 1000, SLOVENIA","0350-5596","1854-3871","","INFORM-INT J COMPUT","Informatica","SEP","2021","45","3","","","","","319","333","","10.31449/inf.v45i3.3248","http://dx.doi.org/10.31449/inf.v45i3.3248","","","15","Computer Science, Software Engineering","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Computer Science","0J6EE","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000780195300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We procure a contribution-and-gain solution - LVRT, a collaborative PoW consensus with low variances of mining reward and of inter-block time, to intensify mining transparency and incentivize collaborative effort. More precisely, LVRT looses the solutions of cryptographic puzzles by introducing tweakable factor to difficulty target and exploits all qualified computing powers (rather than throws them all away except the first one that wins the puzzle, as handled in Bitcoin) to generate the block (all qualified miners would thereby be rewarded). Low variance of inter-block time also stems from our strategy in packing the block that k (a pre-defined system parameter to characterize collaborative effort) smallest out of all qualified hash values are determined and the corresponding average is bounded by difficulty target as well. We define particular block structure to fit our requirements. LVRT is supported by theoretical analysis on the relationship between collaborative effort and the variances of inter-block time and mining reward. Experiments further demonstrate LVRT's resistance against selfish-mining and double-spend attacks. For a double-spend attacker with 40% mining power, it will succeed in Bitcoin with a probability >= 35%, in contrast, his probability is less than 1% in LVRT (for k >= 50).","[Ma, Jiangfeng; Li, Xiangxue; Qian, Haifeng] East China Normal Univ, Sch Software Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiangxue] Shanghai Key Lab Trustworthy Comp, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiangxue] Westone Cryptol Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China","East China Normal University","Li, XX (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Sch Software Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Li, XX (corresponding author), Shanghai Key Lab Trustworthy Comp, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Li, XX (corresponding author), Westone Cryptol Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.","xxli@cs.ecnu.edu.cn; hfqian@cs.ecnu.edu.cn","","","Shanghai Municipal Education Commission [2021-01-07-00-08-E00101]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61971192, 6191101004]; National Cryptography Development Fund [MMJJ20180106]","Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(Shanghai Municipal Education Commission (SHMEC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Cryptography Development Fund","The work was supported by Shanghai Municipal Education Commission (2021-01-07-00-08-E00101), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61971192, 6191101004) and the National Cryptography Development Fund (Grant No. MMJJ20180106).","","33","0","0","0","0","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","2324-898X","","978-1-6654-1658-0","IEEE INT CONF TRUST","","","2021","","","","","","","1039","1048","","10.1109/TrustCom53373.2021.00143","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom53373.2021.00143","","","10","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BT3DY","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000817855700125","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, the blockchain itself contains a number of inefficiencies and areas for improvement, namely: transaction fees and transaction speeds. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) address, and improve on these inefficiencies and a number of digital currencies utilising this technology have already begun to appear. This paper provides an explanation of the technology behind DAG-based assets, while identifying and highlighting strategic advantages that DAGs possess over traditional blockchains. We conduct an EGARCH volatility analysis of a range of blockchain-based and DAG-based cryptocurrencies in the aftermath of a range of market shocks, taking the form of regulatory announcements such as bans and broad restrictions for cryptocurrencies. We find that DAG-based assets become increasingly responsive to market shocks as they mature. Such behaviour mirrors that of established cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin, providing evidence that DAG-based cryptocurrencies now share similar characteristics to traditional blockchainchain based products.

Based on the daily price data of seven leading cryptocurrencies from August 8, 2015 to December 31, 2020, the results show that the connectedness measures in the left and right tails are much higher than those in the mean and median of the con-ditional distribution. This suggests that return connectedness strengthens with shock size for both positive and negative shocks, indicating that return shocks propagate more inten-sely during extreme events relative to calm periods. While this result shows the instability of the system of connectedness under extreme events such as the COVID-19 outbreak, it implies the need to move beyond mean-based connectedness measures to understand the return connectedness under extreme negative and extreme positive shocks. Further analyses based on rolling windows show evidence of asymmetry between the behaviour of return spillovers in lower quantiles and upper quantiles.

This position paper aims at justifying this standpoint and at laying out a vision for the future of decentralized computing. We start by revisiting the definition of decentralized systems, briefly surveying the literature on the taxonomy and different facets of decentralization. We complement existing definitions by proposing Inclusiveness as a critical facet. We argue that our notion of Inclusiveness rules out some popular candidate technologies for a base-level (or L1) blockchain consensus, namely Proof-of-Stake, from replacing Nakamoto's Proof-of-Work (PoW) as the base consensus technology of decentralized systems. We further discuss why the high energy consumption of Bitcoin's PoW consensus is not wasteful and why Bitcoin should be embraced as the money of the future. We then argue that future decentralized systems should aim at leveraging the slow-but-very-secure PoW consensus of Bitcoin, building systems on top of it rather than trying to replace it. Finally, we propose some open problems for decentralized cloud computing research.","[Vukolic, Marko] Protocol Labs, Wilmington, DE 19801 USA","","Vukolic, M (corresponding author), Protocol Labs, Wilmington, DE 19801 USA.","marko@protocol.ai","","","","","","","52","0","0","2","2","EUROPEAN ASSOC THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE","RIO","C/O IOANNIS CHATZIGIANNAKIS, SEC, COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY INST & PRESS-CTI, RIO, 26504, GREECE","0252-9742","","","BULL EUR ASSOC THEOR","Bull.

Moreover, we do not observe any significant asymmetric volatility reponse to past returns in the GJR-GARCH model. Although the multi-variate VARMA-DCCAGARCH model outperforms in sample, it performs worse out of sample than the single-variate GARCH model. Furthermore, the GARCH volatility forecast outperforms the option implied volatility in forecasting future realized volatility. We formulate an option trading strategy by exploiting the volatility spread between the GARCH volatility forecast and the option implied volatility. We show that a simple volatility-spread trading strategy with delta-hedging can yield robust profits for both BTC and ETH options.

Several parametric models are considered for the joint dynamics of the basket price where parameters are modulated through a Hidden Markov Chain with finite state space. Best specifications within Gaussian and Autoregressive models for price differences are selected by means of the AIC and BIC information criteria and through an out-of-sample forecasting per-formance. The empirical results, within the period January 2016 to October 2019, suggest that three or four states may be relevant to describe the dynamics of each individual cryptocurrency, depending on the selection criteria, while the entire basket displays at most three common states. Finally, we show how the identification of appropriate models may be exploited in order to build profitable investment strategies on the considered cryptocurrencies.","[Figa-Talamanca, Gianna] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via A Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy; [Focardi, Sergio] Leonard de Vinci Pole Univ, Res Ctr, F-92916 Paris, France; [Patacca, Marco] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, Via Cantarane 24, I-37129 Verona, Italy","University of Perugia; University of Verona","Figa-Talamanca, G (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via A Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.","gianna.figatalamanca@unipg.it; sergio.focardi@devinci.fr; marco.patacca@univr.it","Patacca, Marco/AAF-2059-2019","Patacca, Marco/0000-0003-3242-429X","Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Perugia [2018.0427.021]","Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Perugia(Fondazione Cassa Risparmio Perugia)","This research was partially funded by Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Perugia, Grant 2018.0427.021.","","41","3","3","2","14","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1062-9408","1879-0860","","N AM J ECON FINANC","N.

Findings Litecoin is the most influential volatility sender in the basket of these three cryptocurrencies. The portfolio weights indicate that investors can create an optimized two asset portfolio with the lowest exposure to Stellar with Litecoin and Ripple. Market players with a long position in Ripple can have the cheapest hedge by shorting Stellar.

Another agendum of this study is to investigate the quantum of extra returns which may result from the presence of calendar effects. Design/methodology/approach The present study considers both parametric and non-parametric approaches to verify calendar effects empirically. Specifically, this study has implemented Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (1, 1) and Kruskal-Wallis tests in the rolling window approach to reveal adaptive patterns of calendar effects. Additionally, the present study has used the implied trading strategy to evaluate the volume of excess returns resulted from calendar effects than buy-and-hold (BH) strategy. Findings The overall results of the current study exhibit that calendar effect in the cryptocurrency market is dynamic rather than static which indicates the calendar effect is a time-varying phenomenon. Moreover, this study also confirmed that ITS is not suitable to obtain extra returns despite the existence of calendar effects. Research limitations/implications The present study has covered some broad aspects of calendar anomalies in the cryptocurrency market, keeping aside certain other limitations which need to be addressed in the following dimensions. Future studies may aim at addressing issues like, Turn-of-the-Year effect, Halloween effect, weather effect, and Month-of-the-Year effects, and try to explore the reasons of presence of dynamic patterns of calendar effects. Practical implications The significant implication of this study is that it alerts investors about market return predictability due to calendar patterns or effects in different periods. It also suggests the period in which the ITS can perform better than the BH strategy. Originality/value It is the first study in the cryptocurrency literature which has adopted the AMH framework to verify adaptive calendar effects or anomalies. Furthermore, this study, instead of a mere examination of the presence of calendar effects, has evaluated the potential of calendar effects to produce extra returns through trading strategies.","[Khuntia, Sashikanta] Deemed Univ, SVKMs Narsee Monjee Inst Management Studies NMIMS, Sch Business Management, Hyderabad Campus, Hyderabad, India; [Pattanayak, J.

Our empirical findings demonstrate that there is substantial interactions between Crypto-Currency and conventional hedge funds.

The basic idea of CoinJoin is to create transactions that combine equal-valued coins of multiple users. This mixing of coins aims to prevent linkage of the users' transactional in- and outputs. The cryptocurrency Dash employs a built-in CoinJoin service and, therefore, is ideal for empirically studying CoinJoin. This paper presents the first empirical analysis of Dash, which reveals that over 40% of all private transactions can be de-anonymized depending on underlying assumptions. The main issue of these attacks is the coin-aggregation problem, i.e. the need to combine outputs of several CoinJoin transactions. The coin aggregation problem is not specific to Dash and affects other cryptocurrencies as empirical evidence in Bitcoin suggests. We show that the logical solution to the problem, namely CoinJoin transactions with non-fixed arbitrary values, suffers from other privacy weaknesses. We propose a novel mixing algorithm to mitigate the need for coin aggregation without introducing additional privacy vulnerabilities. In contrast to prior mixing algorithms, our approach removes the need for fixed values by dynamically creating equal-valued CoinJoin transactions. The mixing algorithm is not specific to Dash, and integration into other cryptocurrencies, especially into Bitcoin, is possible.","[Deuber, Dominic; Schroeder, Dominique] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany","University of Erlangen Nuremberg","Deuber, D (corresponding author), Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.","dominic.deuber@fau.de; dominique.schroeder@fau.de","Schröder, Dominique/GOG-8222-2022","Schröder, Dominique/0000-0001-6943-8914","","","","","22","0","0","1","3","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-88428-4; 978-3-030-88427-7","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2021","12973","","","","","","461","480","","10.1007/978-3-030-88428-4_23","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-88428-4_23","","","20","Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS8JI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000772619000023","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Two tail-based risk metrics, namely Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES), are adopted to study the tail behaviour of market risks in Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies. Empirical investigations for the tail behaviour based on real exchange rate data of cryptocurrencies are conducted. An extreme-value-theory-based approach is used to study potential improvements in the estimation for the risk metrics under GARCH-type models. The possibility of explosive regimes in cryptocurrencies' volatilities is examined using Markov-switching GARCH models.","[Siu, Tak Kuen] Macquarie Univ, Dept Actuarial Studies & Business Analyt, Macquarie Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia","Macquarie University","Siu, TK (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Actuarial Studies & Business Analyt, Macquarie Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.","Ken.Siu@mq.edu.au","","Siu, Tak Kuen/0000-0003-2823-5138","Australian Research Council [DP190102674]","Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","This work was supported by the Australian Research Council [DP190102674].","","75","4","4","3","19","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0003-6846","1466-4283","","APPL ECON","Appl.

DCC parameters confirmed the significant results to assess the spillover effects for return volatilities of five cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Monero, and Peercoin). It indicated that cryptocurrency market returns would be volatile, connected with the time-varying pattern. Most ARCH and GARCH effects were significant in estimating the three pairs of return-mining profitability, return-Tweet, and mining profitability-Tweet. For the cryptocurrency return and profitability pair, returns depended on future price returns and cross-volatility spillover and were greater than their own volatility spillover effect. Moreover, the BEKK diagonal model was found to be the best model for return-mining profitability.

It encourages participants to contribute their computing resources to ensure the correctness and consistency of user transaction records. Selfish mining attacks, however, prove that Bitcoins incentive mechanism is not incentive-compatible, which is contrary to traditional views. Selfish mining attacks may cause the loss of mining power, especially those of honest participants, which brings great security challenges to the Bitcoin system. Although there are a series of studies against selfish mining behaviors, these works have certain limitations: either the existing protocol needs to be modified or the detection effect for attacks is not satisfactory. We propose the ForkDec, a high-accuracy system for selfish mining detection based on the fully connected neural network, for the purpose of effectively deterring selfish attackers. The neural network contains a total of 100 neurons (10 hidden layers and 10 neurons per layer), learned on a training set containing about 200,000 fork samples. The data set, used to train the model, is generated by a Bitcoin mining simulator that we preconstructed. We also applied ForkDec to the test set to evaluate the attack detection and achieved a detection accuracy of 99.03%. The evaluation experiment demonstrates that ForkDec has certain application value and excellent research prospects.","[Wang, Zhaojie; Lv, Qingzhe; Lu, Zhaobo; Wang, Yilei] Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Rizhao 276826, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yilei] Guilin Univ Elect Technol, Guangxi Key Lab Cryptog & Informat Secur, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China; [Yue, Shengjie] Univ Jinan, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Jinan 250022, Peoples R China","Qufu Normal University; Guilin University of Electronic Technology; University of Jinan","Wang, YL (corresponding author), Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Rizhao 276826, Peoples R China.;Wang, YL (corresponding author), Guilin Univ Elect Technol, Guangxi Key Lab Cryptog & Informat Secur, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China.","wang_yilei2019@qfnu.edu.cn","","Wang, Zhaojie/0000-0002-9483-8204; wang, yilei/0000-0003-1524-2064","Foundation of National Natural Science Foundation of China [62072273, 72111530206, 61962009, 61873117, 61832012, 61771231, 61771289]; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2019MF062]; Shandong University Science and Technology Program Project [J18A326]; Guangxi Key Laboratory of Cryptography and Information Security [GCIS202112]; Major Basic Research Project of Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province of China [ZR2018ZC0438]; Major Scientific and Technological Special Project of Guizhou Province [20183001]; Foundation of Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Big Data [2019BD-KFJJ009]; Talent Project of Guizhou Big Data Academy, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Big Data [[2018]01]","Foundation of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Shandong University Science and Technology Program Project; Guangxi Key Laboratory of Cryptography and Information Security; Major Basic Research Project of Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province of China; Major Scientific and Technological Special Project of Guizhou Province; Foundation of Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Big Data; Talent Project of Guizhou Big Data Academy, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Big Data","This study was supported by the Foundation of National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 62072273, 72111530206, 61962009, 61873117, 61832012, 61771231, and 61771289); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (Grant no.

However, with the rising popularity of this new paradigm, the concept of blockchain shifted greatly to the point where many systems marketed as blockchain without sharing the key components introduced by Bitcoin. It has therefore become quite challenging for system designers or decision-makers to achieve a sufficient understanding of different types of existing blockchains or to design and adopt the correct blockchain solution. To overcome this problem, we propose DCEA a holistic reference model for conceptualizing and closely examining blockchains and globally distributed ledger technologies (DLT) using a layer-wise framework that envisions all these systems as constructed of four layers: the data, consensus, execution and application layers.","[Bellaj, Badr; Crespi, Noel] Telecom SudParis, Paris, France; [Bellaj, Badr; Ouaddah, Aafaf; Mezrioui, Abdellatif] Inst Natl Postes & Telecommun, Rabat, Morocco","IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; Institut Polytechnique de Paris","Bellaj, B (corresponding author), Telecom SudParis, Paris, France.;Bellaj, B (corresponding author), Inst Natl Postes & Telecommun, Rabat, Morocco.","bellaj.badr@mchain.uk","Crespi, Noel/ABE-7052-2020","Crespi, Noel/0000-0003-2962-192X","","","","","4","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-3578-9","","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461129","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461129","","","2","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS1IM","","Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000691552500071","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Using a generalized asset pricing model, we find evidence of a risk premium effect in Litecoin and Ripple during the boom of 2017, and that adverse news effects were an important driver of the cryptocurrency crash of 2018 in all four cryptocurrencies. In an out-of-sample forecasting exercise, we find that allowing for stochastic volatility and a heavy tailed distribution provides more accurate return and volatility forecasts compared to a random walk benchmark. This suggests that cryptocurrency markets were not weak-form efficient during this period.","[Cross, Jamie L.] BI Norwegian Business Sch, Oslo, Norway; [Hou, Chenghan] Hunan Univ, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Trinh, Kelly] James Cook Univ, Douglas, Qld, Australia","BI Norwegian Business School; Hunan University; James Cook University","Hou, CH (corresponding author), Hunan Univ, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.","chenghan.hou@hotmail.com","Cross, Jamie Lee/P-1031-2019","Cross, Jamie Lee/0000-0002-3264-0016; Trinh, Kelly/0000-0002-1814-6847","Centre for Applied Macroeconomics and Commodity Prices (CAMP) at the BI Norwegian Business School; National Natural Science Foundation of China [72003064]","Centre for Applied Macroeconomics and Commodity Prices (CAMP) at the BI Norwegian Business School; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","We thank the editor Professor Sushanta Mallick, as well as the associate editor and anonymous reviewers for all of their constructive feedback throughout the review process of the journal.

This study constructs time-series models to examine DeFi- and NFT-related cryptocurrencies and to clarify how their weekly prices fluctuated over a one-year period. Using Google Trends data, we measure how weekly Internet searches into crypto markets generally and specific branded cryptocurrencies affected price fluctuations for each coin. Results show that Bitcoin prices modeled as an exogenous variable have a positive effect on Ethereum prices.

A Granger causality test using the recursive evolving window approach shows a significant causality between the Twitter-based EPU measures and the BTC/USD exchange rate from October 2016 to July 2017. Moreover, a significant causality was noted from the EPU measures to the ETH/USD exchange rate from June 2019 to February 2020 and from the EPU measures to the XRP/USD exchange rate from January 2020 to February 2020. The Twitter-based EPU measures primarily positively affect the returns of the related cryptocurrencies during these periods.

Such a prediction may be helpful to the daily economic and financial market. Unlike forecasting the cryptocurrency returns, we propose a new approach to predict whether the return classification would be in the first, second, third quartile, or any quantile of the gold price the next day. In this paper, we employ the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for exploring the predictability of financial returns for the six major digital currencies selected from the list of top ten cryptocurrencies based on data collected through sensors. These currencies are Binance Coin, Bitcoin, Cardano, Dogecoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. Our study considers the pre-COVID-19 and ongoing COVID-19 periods. An algorithm that allows updated data analysis, based on the use of a sensor in the database, is also proposed. The results show strong evidence that the SVM is a robust technique for devising profitable trading strategies and can provide accurate results before and during the current pandemic. Our findings may be helpful for different stakeholders in understanding the cryptocurrency dynamics and in making better investment decisions, especially under adverse conditions and during times of uncertain environments such as in the COVID-19 pandemic.","[Mahdi, Esam; Mara'Beh, Saed] Qatar Univ, Dept Math Stat & Phys, Doha 2713, Qatar; [Leiva, Victor] Pontificia Univ Catolic Valparaiso, Sch Ind Engn, Valparaiso 2362807, Chile; [Martin-Barreiro, Carlos] Univ Politecn ESPOL, Fac Nat Sci & Math, Guayaquil 090902, Ecuador; [Martin-Barreiro, Carlos] Univ Espiritu Santo, Fac Engn, Samborondon 0901952, Ecuador","Qatar University; Universidad de Especialidades Espiritu Santo","Mahdi, E (corresponding author), Qatar Univ, Dept Math Stat & Phys, Doha 2713, Qatar.","emahdi@qu.edu.qa; victor.leiva@pucv.cl; smarabeh@qu.edu.qa; cmmartin@espol.edu.ec","Martin-Barreiro, Carlos/GZA-4896-2022; Leiva, Victor/AAM-7834-2021; Mahdi, Esam/AAA-3977-2022","Martin-Barreiro, Carlos/0000-0002-8797-681X; Leiva, Victor/0000-0003-4755-3270; Mahdi, Esam/0000-0002-3447-0639; Mara'Beh, Saed/0000-0002-0618-2912","FONDECYT [1200525]; National Agency for Research and Development (ANID) of the Chilean government under the Ministry of Science, Technology, Knowledge and Innovation","FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); National Agency for Research and Development (ANID) of the Chilean government under the Ministry of Science, Technology, Knowledge and Innovation","This research was partially supported by FONDECYT, project grant number 1200525 (V.L.), from the National Agency for Research and Development (ANID) of the Chilean government under the Ministry of Science, Technology, Knowledge and Innovation.","","41","11","11","4","22","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1424-8220","","SENSORS-BASEL","Sensors","SEP","2021","21","18","","","","","","","6319","10.3390/s21186319","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21186319","","","16","Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation","UW0AT","34577525","Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000699830900001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We found that when frequency is combined with regimes, the risk spillover center will undergo subversive changes in the long run.

Their focus is to understand better the price behavior of individual cryptocurrencies and their influence on one another. To achieve this, they segment each cryptocurrency's time series of returns into disparate bull and bear regimes. They then examine the nature and extent of overlap between these regimes and whether they change over time. They also collect and plot several indicative distributed-denial-of-service attacks against the time series to investigate their possible impact on regime change episodes. Their findings shed light on previously unexplored systemic risk indicators within the cryptomarket as a whole and on the relationship between specific cryptocurrency pairs. These findings enhance the risk management toolkit for investors by revealing potential price behavior contagion patterns between cryptocurrencies pertinent to blended portfolio management.

We applied ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions based on a dataset containing 1597 ICOs that covers almost 2.5 years. The results show that exogenous and endogenous signals have a significant effect on the funds raised in ICOs. We also find that the Bitcoin price heavily drives the performance of ICOs. However, this hype effect is moderated, as high-quality ICOs are not pegged to these price developments.

Immutability is a blockchain feature that persists data forever, but it is no longer legal in reality. Blockchain has unchangeable improper contents that violate laws. Moreover, data regulation toward the right to be forgotten requires blockchain must be modifiable. To address this problem, redactable blockchain has been introduced to relax immutability in a controlled way. However, once a participant is authorized, she/he can rewrite any content and no penalty for the malicious behavior that hinders the wide deployment of redactable blockchain in practice. In this paper, we introduce a new notion, dubbed k-time modifiable and epoch-based redactable blockchain (KERB) with a monetary penalty to control rewriting privileges and penalize malicious behaviors. Our solution is built up from simple building blocks: digital signatures and chameleon hashes. We give a formal definition and security models of KERB, and present a generic construction along with formal proofs. The extensive comparison and experimental analysis illustrate that our solution enjoys superior functionalities and performances than the state-of-the-art solutions.","[Xu, Shengmin; Ning, Jianting; Ma, Jinhua; Huang, Xinyi] Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Comp & Cyber Secur, Fujian Prov Key Lab Network Secur & Cryptol, Fuzhou 350117, Peoples R China; [Xu, Shengmin] Singapore Management Univ, Secure Mobile Ctr, Singapore 188065, Singapore; [Ning, Jianting] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, State Key Lab Informat Secur, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Ma, Jinhua; Deng, Robert H.] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Syst, Singapore 188065, Singapore","Fujian Normal University; Singapore Management University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Engineering, CAS; Singapore Management University","Ning, JT (corresponding author), Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Comp & Cyber Secur, Fujian Prov Key Lab Network Secur & Cryptol, Fuzhou 350117, Peoples R China.;Ning, JT (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, State Key Lab Informat Secur, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.","smxu1989@gmail.com; jtning88@gmail.com; jinhuama55@hotmail.com; xyhuang81@gmail.com; robertdeng@smu.edu.sg","","Xu, Shengmim/0000-0002-9121-0171; Deng, Robert/0000-0003-3491-8146; Ning, Jianting/0000-0001-7165-398X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [62102090, 62032005, 61972094, 61872089]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62102090, Grant 62032005, Grant 61972094, and Grant 61872089.","","38","2","2","15","28","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","1556-6013","1556-6021","","IEEE T INF FOREN SEC","IEEE Trans.

Here, we employ a common universal framework to characterise the many aspects of anonymity achieved, or not, by any (crypto, digital, or physical) currency schemes, irrespective of the underlying implementation. We focus on a few high-profile practical cases of interest (including Bitcoin, Zcash, Monero, Mimblewimble) and use our common framework to draw detailed and meaningful comparisons.","[Amarasinghe, Niluka; Boyen, Xavier; McKague, Matthew] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Queensland University of Technology (QUT)","Amarasinghe, N; Boyen, X; McKague, M (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.","niluka.amarasinghe@qut.edu.au; xavier.boyen@qut.edu.au; matthew.mckague@qut.edu.au","","","Australian Research Council Future Fellowship [FT140101145]","Australian Research Council Future Fellowship(Australian Research Council)","Xavier Boyen is the recipient of an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship and acknowledges generous support from the grant, number FT140101145.

However, we find that Ethereum, a popular and leading cryptocurrency in the market, has Blockchain information that differs from that of Bitcoin. Hence, this study investigates the relationship between inherent Ethereum Blockchain information and Ethereum prices. Furthermore, we investigate how Blockchain information concerning other publicly available coins on the market is associated with Ethereum prices.

However, employing blockchain DLT entails considerable energy consumption in the mining process. This paper proposes a blockchain accelerator (BCA) with ultralow power consumption and a high processing rate to address the problem. The BCA focuses on accelerating the double secure hash algorithm (SHA) 256 function required in the mining process at a system-onchip (SoC) level. We propose three ideas, namely, multiple local memories (multimem), double-cell processing element (D-PE), and nonce autoupdate (NAU), to reduce the external data transfer time and improve the BCA hardware efficiency. We propose a cascaded multiple BCA chip model to enhance the system throughput by several-fold. Our experiments on an ASIC and FPGA prove that the proposed BCA successfully performs the mining process for multiple blockchain networks with much lower power consumption than that of the state-of-the-art CPUs and GPUs. The BCA is laid out with Renesas 65 nm technology with a chip area of 25 mm(2) and consumes 530 mW at 100 MHz. The power efficiency of the layout chip is improved by 2428 and 143 times compared with that of the fastest CPU Intel i9-10940X and GPU RTX 3090, respectively.","[Tran, Thi Hong; Pham, Hoai Luan; Phan, Tri Dung; Nakashima, Yasuhiko] Nara Inst Sci & Technol NAIST, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Ikoma 6300192, Japan","Nara Institute of Science & Technology","Tran, TH (corresponding author), Nara Inst Sci & Technol NAIST, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Ikoma 6300192, Japan.","hong@is.naist.jp","","Nakashima, Yasuhiko/0000-0002-9457-5061; Luan, Pham Hoai/0000-0002-4272-0132; Tran, Thi Hong/0000-0002-2744-0079","Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) through Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO) [2020A031]","Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) through Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO)","This work was supported by Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) through Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO) under Grant 2020A031.","","33","3","3","2","6","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","1549-8328","1558-0806","","IEEE T CIRCUITS-I","IEEE Trans.

The rapidly increasing blockchain forks have resulted in fierce competition and created significant controversies in blockchain community. To analyze this competitive aspect, we consider blockchain as a two-sided platform that serves both customers and miners. We develop a game-theoretic model to investigate how a blockchain platform's decision on its settings, such as block size and transaction fee, affects the competition between blockchain platforms as well as the participation behavior of customers and miners. Our findings suggest that increasing the transaction fee alleviates congestion on the platform when customers have a relatively balanced need between efficiency and safety. In contrast, it induces congestion when efficiency is valued over safety. In addition, under hard fork competition, the difference in blockchain platforms' block sizes directs the attention of miners towards different types of mining rewards. Moreover, it also affects the optimal types of customers the blockchain platforms should target. Furthermore, we find that the degree of congestion and the risk attitudes of participants play vital roles in differentiating different block-sized platforms' optimal transaction fees. We provide empirical evidence on the theoretical findings and practical implications for blockchain platform competition with respect to the behaviors of platform participants. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

A salient feature of the RL learning framework is that an optimal (or near-optimal) strategy can be obtained without knowing the details of the blockchain network model. Previously, the most profitable mining strategy was believed to be honest mining encoded in the default blockchain protocol. It was shown later that it is possible to gain more mining rewards by deviating from honest mining. In particular, the mining problem can be formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) which can be solved to give the optimal mining strategy. However, solving the mining MDP requires knowing the values of various parameters that characterize the blockchain network model. In real blockchain networks, these parameter values are not easy to obtain and may change over time. This hinders the use of the MDP model-based solution. In this study, we employ RL to dynamically learn a mining strategy with performance approaching that of the optimal mining strategy. Since the mining MDP problem has a nonlinear objective function (rather than linear functions of standard MDP problems), we design a new multidimensional RL algorithm to solve the problem. Experimental results indicate that, without knowing the parameter values of the mining MDP model, our multidimensional RL mining algorithm can still achieve optimal performance over time-varying blockchain networks.","[Wang, Taotao; Zhang, Shengli] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Liew, Soung Chang] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Informat Engn, Ho Sin Hang Engn Bldg,Rm 709, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Shenzhen University; Chinese University of Hong Kong","Liew, SC (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Informat Engn, Ho Sin Hang Engn Bldg,Rm 709, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","soung@ie.cuhk.edu.hk","","Liew, Soung Chang/0000-0001-7055-6483; Zhang, Shengli/0000-0002-7937-5870","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFB2100705]; Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Province [2020A1515010708]","National Key R&D Program of China; Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province)","National Key R&D Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2018YFB2100705; Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Province, Grant/Award Number: 2020A1515010708","","30","11","11","7","22","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0884-8173","1098-111X","","INT J INTELL SYST","Int.

Bitcoin is nothing but a form of digital currency (cryptocurrency) that can be used for trading in place of fiat money, where the underlying infrastructure is called Blockchain. The Blockchain is an open ledger that provides decentralization, transparency, immutability, and confidentiality. Blockchain can be used in massive, beneficial applications such as healthcare, logistics, supply chain management, the Internet of Things (IoT), etc. Most of the industrial applications rely on the permissioned Blockchain. However, the permissioned Blockchain fails in some aspects, such as scalability and throughput. This paper suggests a system to solve the scalability issue of permissioned Blockchain by incorporating data science techniques.

There has been several recent work in doing secret sharing in a distributed manner through the use of Blockchain so that one does not have to rely on trusted third parties nor strong assumptions about the communication medium. This paper continues this line of work and presents a new protocol for distributed key generation (DKG). We develop a new technique that leverages the mainchain of a popular blockchain platform like Bitcoin, together with a mixing service and a group signature scheme, to provide anonymity and traceability; we connect this to a sidechain, pegged to the mainchain, that brings a better scalability. We implemented the technique on the joint platform Bitcoin/RootStock and use CoinJoin/CoinShuffle as the mixing service. The evaluation section shows a decrease by 99% in the execution cost of our protocol compared to the same implementation on a smart-contract-friendly blockchain such as Ethereum.","[Dehez-Clementi, Marina; Lacan, Jerome] ISAE SUPAERO, DISC, Toulouse, France; [Deneuville, Jean-Christophe] ENAC, ReSCo, Toulouse, France; [Asghar, Hassan; Kaafar, Dali] Macquarie Univ, Dept Comp, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Universite de Toulouse; Institut Superieur de l'Aeronautique et de l'Espace (ISAE-SUPAERO); Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; Ecole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile (ENAC); Macquarie University","Dehez-Clementi, M (corresponding author), ISAE SUPAERO, DISC, Toulouse, France.","marina.dehez-clementi@isae-supaero.fr; jerome.lacan@isae-supaero.fr; jean-christophe.deneuville@enac.fr; hassan.asghar@mq.edu.au; dali.kaafar@mq.edu.au","DEHEZ CLEMENTI, Marina/AHE-2821-2022; Asghar, Hassan Jameel/M-2608-2018","Kaafar, Mohamed Ali/0000-0003-2714-0276; Dehez-Clementi, Marina/0000-0003-0783-9848; Asghar, Hassan Jameel/0000-0001-6168-6497","French government through the Toulouse graduate School of Aerospace Engineering (TSAE) [ANR-17-EURE-0005]; Optus Macquarie University Cyber Securiy Hub","French government through the Toulouse graduate School of Aerospace Engineering (TSAE); Optus Macquarie University Cyber Securiy Hub","This work was partly supported by the French government through the Toulouse graduate School of Aerospace Engineering (TSAE).

In this paper, and in the pursuit of understanding the attack surface of blockchains, we explore a new form of attack that can be carried out on the memory pools (mempools), and mainly targets blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. We study this attack on Bitcoin's mempool and explore the attack's effects on transactions fee paid by benign users. To counter this attack, this paper further proposes Contra-*, a set of countermeasures utilizing fee, age, and size (thus, Contra-F, Contra-A, and Contra-S) as prioritization mechanisms.

However, as technology is increasing, transaction frauds are growing, and there is a need to detect vulnerabilities in systems. A methodology is proposed to identify suspicious users based on their reputation score by collaborating centrality measures and machine learning techniques. The results are validated on two cryptocurrencies network datasets, Bitcoin-OTC, and Bitcoin-Alpha, which contain information of the system formed by the users and the user's trust score. Results found that the proposed approach provides improved and accurate results. Hence, the fusion of machine learning with centrality measures provides a highly robust system and can be adapted to prevent smart devices' financial services.","[Mittal, Ruchi] Netaji Subhas Inst Technol, New Delhi, India; [Bhatia, M.

More specifically, this study assesses whether crisis periods, particularly the coronavirus disease pandemic, influence the dynamic of cryptocurrency volatility. We investigate the four main cryptocurrency markets (Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic, Ethereum, and Ripple) from April 2018 to June 2020. The realized volatility measure is computed and decomposed to various components (continuous versus discontinuous, positive and negative semi-variances, and signed jumps). A variety of heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) models are developed including these components, thereby enabling assessment of different assumptions (including persistence and asymmetric dynamic) of modelling and volatility forecasting based on in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting strategies, respectively. Our results reveal three main findings. First, the extended HAR model that includes the positive and negative jumps appears to be the best model for predicting future volatility for both crisis and non-crisis periods. Second, during the crisis period, only the negative jump component is statistically significant. Third, in terms of volatility forecasting, the results show that the extended HAR model that includes positive and negative semi-variances outperform the other models.","[Ftiti, Zied] EDC Paris Business Sch, OCRE Lab, 70 Galerie des Damiers,La Def 1, F-92415 Paris, France; [Louhichi, Wael] ESSCA Sch Management, Paris, France; [Ben Ameur, Hachmi] INSEEC Univ Rsearch Ctr, INSEEC Grande Ecole, Paris, France","ESSCA Ecole de Management","Ftiti, Z (corresponding author), EDC Paris Business Sch, OCRE Lab, 70 Galerie des Damiers,La Def 1, F-92415 Paris, France.","Zied.Ftiti@edcparis.edu; Wael.louhichi@essca.fr; hbenameur@inseec.com","","Ftiti, Zied/0000-0002-6216-1104","","","","","57","9","9","1","11","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0254-5330","1572-9338","","ANN OPER RES","Ann.

These new type of assets are characterised by wild swings in prices and this can lead to great profit as well as large losses. To respond to these dynamics, crypto investors need adequate tools to guide them through their choice of optimal portfolio selection. This paper presents a portfolio selection based on COGARCH and regular vine copula which are able to capture features such as abrupt jumps in prices, heavy-tailed distribution and dependence structure respectively, with the optimal portfolio achieved through the stochastic heuristic algorithm differential evolution known for its global search solution ability.

However, in some cases tracing user's identity is also very important, especially to expose illegal transactions. In this paper, we propose an identity tracing scheme and implement it using a simple and efficient proof method. In particular, we design a new signature scheme that is used to generate a user's certificate, and present a binding method for the user's certificate and trading public key. Users only need to register once with the supervision center, and then the center may trace sender's identity of the transactions on the blockchain. Our scheme is suitable to blockchain-based systems that explicitly use public/private key pairs, and does not affect the anonymity property of the original system. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Blockchain is the core technology of digital currencies, e.g. the Bitcoin system [21], and has received extensive attention from academy and industry. Blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology that solves the trust problem in a multi-center environment. The trust problem is how do the nodes that do not trust each other reach a consensus without a trusted third party. Taking Bitcoin as an example, the transactions need to be verified and recorded in a distributed environment. By using blockchain technology, users can finally reach a consensus on the ledger. Blocks of transactions are created when parties exchange coins, and one block occurs approximately every 10 min [9,12]. All the blocks are linked (see Fig. 1), and by using public/private key pairs, only Bitcoin owners can transfer their coins, while the authenticity of the transactions may be verified by anyone. Blockchain technology has been initially used in the financial field.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are popular alternatives to traditional cash and investment. We indicate a research gap in the literature review. We find out that current research focused rarely on portfolio diversification using bibliographic analysis in VOSviewer. We think that portfolio diversification is extremely important on the crypto market for most investors because virtual currencies are very risky compared to traditional assets. The primary aim is to construct an optimal portfolio consisting of several cryptocurrencies without traditional assets using a modern theory portfolio. The total sample consists of 16 virtual currencies from 1 October 2017 to 13 January 2020. We mainly obtain historical data on the daily close price of cryptocurrencies from Yahoo Finance. The results show that the optimal portfolio using Markowitz approach consists of Cardano, Binance Coin, and Bitcoin.

However, the biggest challenge in existing blockchain technologies is unnecessary wastage of resources, such as electricity, due to network traffic and inefficient reward mechanisms during the blockchain mining process. To overcome this, we introduce a lightweight blockchain framework to reduce the cost of computationally intensive mining processes and network traffic while fairly rewarding concurrent miners. The proposed framework divides the traditional blockchain into two layers: master node(s) and slave agents (SAs). We develop mechanisms to (i) compute the reward accuracy of successful miners considering the significant factors of time taken to identify a number used only once (nonce) and their reward success rate history, (ii) ensure the reliability of new transactions with an equivalent proof of work consensus, (iii) handle SAs who identify a nonce value at the same time as other SAs while rewarding successful miners fairly, (iv) analyze the fairness of the reward accuracy model by catering to a successful miner who failed to receive a success reward to compensate for costs spent on the mining process and network traffic, and (v) reduce electricity usage and scalability problems during the integration of the blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT) by subdividing the blockchain into separate shards. We find that a lower weight percentage of the time taken to identify a nonce has a more significant effect on reward accuracy than does a higher weight percentage. Further, our results show that the time taken to identify a nonce has a higher dependence on reward accuracy than on the effect of the reward success rate history. We compare our algorithm with the existing algorithms and found the same algorithm complexity O(N) in the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. We determine the break-even point to compensate for the cost of the mining process and network traffic. Consequently, we enable the possibility of compensation for a successful blockchain miner who failed to be granted a reward. This motivates miners to verify and validate new transactions before a new transaction is added to the blockchain. We also adopt an adversary model to obtain the fraction of participating master nodes and SAs that must be compromised by the adversaries to compromise our Master?Slave blockchain (MSB). In this study, we use an electronic healthcare system to illustrate how the proposed MSB works. However, our MSB could be applied in many fields, including the IoT, supply chain management, energy, and commodity transactions.","[Ekanayake, Omeshika A.

After the shutdown, the long memory between cryptocurrencies and Chinese gold has weakened, and the long memory between cryptocurrencies and the RMB/US dollar exchange rate market was strengthened.

Consequently, the volatility of the various cryptocurrency prices attracts substantial attention from both investors and researchers. It is a challenging task to forecast the prices of cryptocurrencies due to the non-stationary prices and the stochastic effects in the market. Current cryptocurrency price forecasting models mainly focus on analyzing exogenous factors, such as macro-financial indicators, blockchain information, and social media data - with the aim of improving the prediction accuracy. However, the intrinsic systemic noise, caused by market and political conditions, is complex to interpret. Inspired by the strong correlations among cryptocurrencies and the powerful modelling capability displayed by deep learning techniques, we propose a Weighted & Attentive Memory Channels model to predict the daily close price and the fluctuation of cryptocurrencies. In particular, our proposed model consists of three modules: an Attentive Memory module combines a Gated Recurrent Unit with a self-attention component to establish attentive memory for each input sequence; a Channel-wise Weighting module receives the price of several heavyweight cryptocurrencies and learns their interdependencies by recalibrating the weights for each sequence; and a Convolution & Pooling module extracts local temporal features, thereby improving the generalization ability of the overall model. In order to validate the proposed model, we conduct a battery of experiments. The results show that our proposed scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms the baseline models in prediction error, accuracy, and profitability.","[Zhang, Zhuorui; Zhou, Junhao; Mondal, Subrota Kumar] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Informat Technol, Macau, Peoples R China; [Garcia, Miguel Martinez] Loughborough Univ, Sch Aeronaut & Automot Engn, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Wang, Hao] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Trondheim, Norway; [Dai, Hong-Ning] Lingnan Univ, Dept Comp Decis Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Macau University of Science & Technology; Loughborough University; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Lingnan University","Dai, HN (corresponding author), Lingnan Univ, Dept Comp Decis Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","hndai@ieee.org; junhao_zhou@qq.com; skmondal@must.edu.mo; m.martinez-garcia@lboro.ac.uk; hawa@ntnu.no","","","Macao Science and Technology Development Fund under Macao Funding Scheme for Key R \ D Projects [0025/2019/AKP]","Macao Science and Technology Development Fund under Macao Funding Scheme for Key R \ D Projects","The work described in this paper was partially supported by Macao Science and Technology Development Fund under Macao Funding Scheme for Key R \& D Projects (0025/2019/AKP).

To realize it, it has developed a blockchain technology using the concept of 'Proof of Work' (PoW). The miners, nodes responsible for writing transaction database, solve a cryptographic puzzle to claim the right to write to the database. Though bitcoin and many other relevant cryptocurrencies such as ether use revolutionary ideas, the main criticism involves the computing resource and energy consumption to solve the puzzles that have otherwise no use. There are attempts to use the PoW to do something useful, commonly referred to as Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW). In this paper, we attempt to (i) make PoUW more usable - describe how a central problem setter can crowdsource their work as PoUW and (ii) in the true spirit of blockchains, decentralize the role of problem setter, whom we call puzzlers. We propose a formal framework to do so, namely PUPoW. PUPoW has an inbuilt provision of payments from puzzler to the miner who solves its puzzle. Additionally, miners have the option to not rely on continuous feed of the puzzles and instead use original PoW puzzles. We also propose a way to use PUPoW for solving TOR vanity URL generation and bitcoin vanity address generation problems. We call this PUPoW blockchain solving vanity address generation problems as VanityCoin. Both the problems need to generate public keys from private keys such that resultant addresses are of interest. Such key pairs are found only by a brute force search. However, there are privacy concerns that miners would know the private keys of the puzzlers. We resolve this by splitting the private keys, and the miners would know only one part of it. In summary, we are proposing how PoW can be made practically useful, and we believe such an approach is needed for PoW blockchains to survive.","[Chaurasia, Yash; Subramanian, Visvesh; Gujar, Sujit] Int Inst Informat Technol, Hyderabad, India","International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad","Chaurasia, Y (corresponding author), Int Inst Informat Technol, Hyderabad, India.","yash.chaurasia@research.iiit.ac.in; visvesh.subramanian@research.iiit.ac.in; sujit.gujar@iiit.ac.in","","","","","","","9","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-1760-0","","","","2021","","","","","","","122","129","","10.1109/Blockchain53845.2021.00026","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain53845.2021.00026","","","8","","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","","BS9CN","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000779214600015","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, when the disclosures are further categorized into cryptocurrency and blockchain disclosures, the result only holds for blockchain disclosures, not for cryptocurrency disclosures. To further identify the topics and themes of these disclosures, we adopt latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling. Among the five topics that are identified from the blockchain and cryptocurrency disclosures through LDA (blockchain technology solutions, risk factors, general business descriptions, payment services, and bitcoin transactions), we find that only the disclosures about blockchain technology solutions and risk factors have positive value relevance, while the disclosures about bitcoin transactions are negative.

In part, this challenge derives from the constantly evolving practices, actants, and geographies enrolled in the digital. When these phenomena are coupled with over-the-top expectations and media hype, initial impressions often mask the complicated and nuanced ways new technologies are put to use. Blockchain (and its original application Bitcoin) represent one of these new, unstable digital phenomena that simultaneously captures public imagination and generates powerful discourses of disruption and change. One way of clarifying the messiness of technologies like blockchain is to ground its practices within the materiality of geography. The DIGO framework proposed in this article uses four broad categories-discourses (measured via Twitter), infrastructures (indicated by Bitcoin mining), groupings (based on firms and exchanges), and outcomes (measured by initial coin offerings)-located in geographic space. Each category is meant to provide insight on blockchain as it unfolds across space and scale. The same framework can guide research on other digital phenomena, based on appropriate measures for each of the four DIGO foci.","[Zook, Matthew; McCanless, Michael] Univ Kentucky, Dept Geog, 817 Patterson Off Tower, Lexington, KY 40508 USA","University of Kentucky","McCanless, M (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Geog, 817 Patterson Off Tower, Lexington, KY 40508 USA.","michael.mccanless@uky.edu","","McCanless, Michael/0000-0002-5332-0484","National Science Foundation (Geography and Spatial Sciences Award) [1853718]","National Science Foundation (Geography and Spatial Sciences Award)","Thanks to Ian Spangler for making the map featured in Figure 1 and to Joe Blankenship for generating the data shown in Table 3.

Alice incentivizes miners to censor Bob's transaction by leaving almost all her value to miners in general. Miners follow (or refuse) this bribe if their expected payoff is better (or worse). We explore conditions under which this attack is possible, and how HTLC participants can protect themselves against the attack.

We also evaluate the forecasting power of higher-order moments for future cryptocurrency returns. The empirical analysis draws on a quantile regression approach, after orthogonalizing raw returns with respect to a diverse set of global influences and risk factors. The results reveal that all moments up to the fifth order are generally relevant to explaining cryptocurrency returns, but with different degrees, depending on both the type and state of the cryptomarket.

This paper aims to critically evaluate the effectiveness of the crypto-asset regulation in the UK and the consistency of the existing regulatory scheme. Design/methodology/approach This paper adopts comparative methods to carry out the analysis. The paper begins by elaborating the development of crypto-assets alongside the financial innovation in the world and pinpointing the core Acts and Regulations applied to crypto-assets in the UK. The paper also discusses a court case in the EU to highlight an argument among legal professions concerning crypto-assets classification. Findings Through carefully analysing relevant primary and secondary legislation of the UK and EU, this paper identifies some unclarified issues in the regulatory framework and discovers three flaws in the regulatory system. The paper concludes that the effectiveness of the current regulatory scheme is poor and room for improvement exists. Originality/value The paper provides the first review and a thorough analysis of the Laws and Acts applied to the crypto-asset regulation in the UK. It also calls on a simpler and clearer regulatory scheme from the perspectives of market participants and consumers. The discovered issues in the crypto-asset regulation in the UK may urge authorities to improve the existing regulatory frameworks and legal provisions.","[Huang, Sherena Sheng] Bangor Univ, Sch Law, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales","Bangor University","Huang, SS (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Sch Law, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales.","sherena.h@hotmail.com","HUANG, SHERENA/AAW-5023-2021","HUANG, SHERENA/0000-0001-6489-3088","","","","","66","2","2","5","18","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1358-1988","1740-0279","","J FINANC REGUL COMPL","J.

Most are introduced with a so-called whitepaper containing a mix of technical documentation, legal boilerplate and marketing material. Notably, many proposed currencies reuse text from previous established cryptocurrencies. We analyze the whitepapers from 1 260 actively traded cryptocurrencies and 2 039 ICOs. We develop two measures of similarity. Moderately similar papers reuse text in a portion of the paper, often the legal disclaimers. By contrast, some highly similar whitepapers appear to copy most of the text. 4% of coin and 19% of ICO whitepapers are highly similar to those of traded coins. The fraction rises to 64% for coins and 67% for ICOs when we consider moderate text reuse.","[Morin, Andrew; Moore, Tyler] Univ Tulsa, Tandy Sch Comp Sci, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA; [Vasek, Marie] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London, England","University of Tulsa; University of London; University College London","Morin, A (corresponding author), Univ Tulsa, Tandy Sch Comp Sci, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA.","anm1198@utulsa.edu; m.vasek@ucl.ac.uk; tyler-moore@utulsa.edu","","","US National Science Foundation [1714291, 1849729]; Blavatnik Interdisciplinary Cyber Research Center (Tel Aviv University)","US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Blavatnik Interdisciplinary Cyber Research Center (Tel Aviv University)","We gratefully acknowledge support from the US National Science Foundation Awards No. 1714291 and 1849729 and the Blavatnik Interdisciplinary Cyber Research Center (at Tel Aviv University).","","12","0","0","1","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-3578-9","","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461147","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461147","","","5","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS1IM","","Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000691552500089","View Full Record in Web of Science"

With the rise of ready-to-use mining scripts distributed by service providers (e.g., Coinhive), it has become trivial to turn a website into a cryptominer by copying and pasting the mining script. Both legitimate webpage owners who want to raise an extra revenue under users' explicit consent and malicious actors who wish to exploit the computational power of the users' computers without their consent have started to utilize this emerging paradigm of cryptocurrency operations. In-browser cryptomining, though mostly abused by malicious actors in practice, is indeed a promising funding model that can be utilized by website owners, publishers, or non-profit organizations for legitimate business purposes, such as to collect revenue or donations for humanitarian projects, inter alia. However, our analysis in this paper shows that in practice, regardless of their being legitimate or not, all in-browser mining scripts are treated the same as malicious cryptomining samples (aka cryptojacking) and blacklisted by browser extensions or antivirus programs. Indeed, there is a need for a better understanding of the in-browser cryptomining ecosystem. Hence, in this paper, we present an in-depth empirical analysis of in-browser cryptomining processes, focusing on the samples explicitly asking for user consent, which we call permissioned cryptomining. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study focusing on the permissioned cryptomining samples. For this, we created a dataset of 6269 unique websites containing cryptomining scripts in their source codes to characterize the in-browser cryptomining ecosystem by differentiating permissioned and permissionless cryptomining samples. We believe that (1) this paper is the first attempt showing that permissioned in-browser cryptomining could be a legitimate and viable monetization tool if implemented responsibly and without interrupting the user, and (2) this paper will catalyze the widespread adoption of legitimate cryptomining with user consent and awareness.","[Tekiner, Ege; Acar, Abbas; Uluagac, A.

The wavelet analysis illustrates the interdependence between investor attention and the cryptocurrency returns. Multi-scale quantile Granger causality based on wavelet decomposition further demonstrates bidirectional Granger causality between investor attention and the returns of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin for all quantiles, except for the medium. Among them, the Granger causality from investor attention to the returns is relatively very weak for Ethereum. In the short term, the Granger causality from these cryptocurrency returns to investor attention seems symmetric, but in the medium-and longterm, the causality shows some asymmetry. The Granger causality from investor attention to these cryptocurrency returns is asymmetric and varies across cryptocurrencies and time scales. Specifically, investor attention has a relatively stronger impact on the cryptocurrency returns in bearish markets than that in bullish markets in the short term.","[Li, Rong] Huaihua Coll, Sch Business, Huaihua 418008, Peoples R China; [Li, Sufang] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Stat & Math, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Di] Shandong Univ, Business Sch, Weihai 264209, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Huiming] Hunan Univ, Coll Business Adm, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China","Huaihua University; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law; Shandong University; Hunan University","Li, SF (corresponding author), Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Stat & Math, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China.;Yuan, D (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Business Sch, Weihai 264209, Peoples R China.","lirong917@aliyun.com; lisufang@zuel.edu.cn; di_yuan@sdu.edu.cn; zhuhuiming@hnu.edu.cn","","ZHU, Huiming/0000-0001-6384-7258; Yuan, Di/0000-0002-6048-7696","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71301166]; Ministry of Education in China Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [13YJC910007]; Chinese National Funding of Social Sciences [18BTJ032, 15CTJ010]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education in China Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; Chinese National Funding of Social Sciences","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant No.71301166, Ministry of Education in China Project of Humanities and Social Sciences under grant No. 13YJC910007 and Chinese National Funding of Social Sciences under grant No. 18BTJ032 and 15CTJ010.","","95","9","9","15","66","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0275-5319","1878-3384","","RES INT BUS FINANC","Res.

Bitcoin's blockchain uses Proof-of-Work as a Sybil control mechanism. However, PoW wastes energy since it uses hash computing competitions to find a block. Hence, various alternative mechanisms have been proposed. Among them, Proof-of-Stake, which is based on the deposit, has been spotlighted. As opposed to Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake requires nodes to have a certain amount of tokens (stake) in order to qualify to validate blocks. The one-sentence philosophy of proof of stake is not security comes from burning energy, but rather security comes from putting up economic value-at-loss. In this article, contrary to popular belief, we point out that this value-at-loss can be hedged by short selling or other financial products. We propose a shorting attack, which makes a profit by massive short selling and sabotage to a Proof-of-Stake-based cryptocurrency. The shorting attack implies that the security of Proof-of-Stake-based cryptocurrency can be vulnerable by a low stake ratio.","[Lee, Suhyeon; Kim, Seungjoo] Korea Univ, Sch Cybersecur, ICSP Inst Cyber Secur & Privacy, Seoul, South Korea","Korea University","Kim, S (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Sch Cybersecur, Seoul 02841, South Korea.","skim71@korea.ac.kr","","Kim, Seungjoo/0000-0002-2157-0403; Lee, Suhyeon/0000-0002-1318-6612","Institute for Information& communications Technology Promotion (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT) [2018-0-00532]","Institute for Information& communications Technology Promotion (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT)","This work was supported by Institute for Information& communications Technology Promotion (IITP) grant funded by theKorea government (MSIT) (No.2018-0-00532, Development of High-Assurance [EAL6] Secure Microkernel)","","25","1","1","1","7","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1532-0626","1532-0634","","CONCURR COMP-PRACT E","Concurr.

In this paper, we propose an architecture where devices (also called nodes) can reach a consensus on task results using off-chain smart contracts and private data. The proposed distributed computing architecture can accelerate computing-intensive and data-intensive supervised classification algorithms with limited resources. This architecture can significantly increase privacy protection and prevent leakage of distributed data. Our proposed architecture can support heterogeneous data, making computing on each device more efficient.

These protocols involve competition among miners in solving cryptopuzzles (e.g. SHA-256 hash computation in Bitcoin) in exchange for a monetary reward. Here, we model mining as an all-pay auction, where miners' computational efforts are interpreted as bids, and the allocation function is the probability of solving the cryptopuzzle in a single attempt with unit (normalized) computational capability. Such an allocation function captures how blockchain systems control the difficulty of the cryptopuzzle as a function of miners' computational abilities (bids). In an attempt to reduce mining costs, we investigate designing a mining auction mechanism which induces a logit equilibrium amongst the miners with choice distributions that are unilaterally decreasing with costs at each miner. We show it is impossible to design a lenient allocation function that does this. Specifically, we show that there exists no allocation function that discourages miners to bid higher costs at logit equilibrium, if the rate of change of difficulty with respect to each miner's cost is bounded by the inverse of the sum of costs of all the miners. Additionally, we also show that it is necessary to have allocation functions that decrease with increasing number of players. As a result, it is difficult to achieve decentralization and accomplish secure blockchain systems with global block difficulty which relies only on total hash rate.","[Nadendla, Venkata Sriram Siddhardh] Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Rolla, MO 65401 USA; [Varshney, Lav R.] Univ Illinois, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","University of Missouri System; Missouri University of Science & Technology; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","Nadendla, VSS (corresponding author), Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Rolla, MO 65401 USA.","nadendla@mst.edu; varshney@illinois.edu","","","","","","","27","0","0","1","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-3578-9","","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461110","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461110","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS1IM","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000691552500053","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It has been widely deployed in decentralized crypto currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is the success story of a public blockchain application that propelled intense research and development into blockchain technology. However, scalability remains a crucial challenge. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are encountering low-efficiency issues with low throughput, high transaction latency, and huge energy consumption. The scalability issue in public Blockchains is hindering the provision of optimal solutions to businesses and industries. This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on the public blockchain scalability issue and challenges. The scope of this SLR includes an in-depth investigation into the scalability problem of public blockchain, associated fundamental factors, and state-of-art solutions. This project managed to extract 121 primary papers from major scientific databases such as Scopus, IEEE explores, Science Direct, and Web of Science. The synthesis of these 121 articles revealed that scalability in public blockchain is not a singular term. A variety of factors are allied to it, with transaction throughput being the most discussed factor. In addition, other interdependent vita factors include storages, block size, number of nodes, energy consumption, latency, and cost. Generally, each term is somehow directly or indirectly reliant on the consensus model embraced by the blockchain nodes. It is also noticed that the contemporary available consensus models are not efficient in scalability and thus often fail to provide good QoS (throughput and latency) for practical industrial applications. Our findings exemplify that the Internet of Things (IoT) would be the leading application of blockchain in industries such as energy, finance, resource management, healthcare, education, and agriculture. These applications are, however, yet to achieve much-desired outcomes due to scalability issues. Moreover, Onchain and offchain are the two major categories of scalability solutions. Sagwit, block size expansion, sharding, and consensus mechanisms are examples of onchain solutions.

One such system is the BIP32 wallet (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 32), which since its introduction in 2012 has been adopted by countless Bitcoin users and is one of the most frequently used wallet system today. Surprisingly, very little is known about the concrete security properties offered by this system. In this work, we propose the first formal analysis of the BIP32 system in its entirety and without any modification. Building on the recent work of Das et al. (CCS '19), we put forth a formal model for hierarchical deterministic wallet systems (such as BIP32) and give a security reduction in this model from the existential unforgeability of the ECDSA signature algorithm that is used in BIP32. We conclude by giving concrete security parameter estimates achieved by the BIP32 standard, and show that by moving to an alternative key derivation method we can achieve a tighter reduction offering an additional 20 bits of security (111 vs. 91 bits of security) at no additional costs.","[Das, Poulami; Erwig, Andreas; Faust, Sebastian; Riahi, Siavash] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany; [Loss, Julian] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Technical University of Darmstadt; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park","Das, P (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany.","poulami.das@tu-darmstadt.de; andreas.erwig@tu-darmstadt.de; sebastian.faust@tu-darmstadt.de; lossjulian@gmail.com; siavash.riahi@tu-darmstadt.de","","","German Research Foundation (DFG) Emmy Noether Program [FA 1320/1-1]; German Research Foundation [DFG -SFB 1119 -236615297]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) iBlockchain Project [16KIS0902]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within National Research Center for Applied Cybersecurity ATHENE; Hessen State Ministry for Higher Education, Research and the Arts within National Research Center for Applied Cybersecurity ATHENE","German Research Foundation (DFG) Emmy Noether Program(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) iBlockchain Project(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within National Research Center for Applied Cybersecurity ATHENE; Hessen State Ministry for Higher Education, Research and the Arts within National Research Center for Applied Cybersecurity ATHENE","The authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.

For example, Bitcoin uses Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm, which takes 60 minutes to acknowledge a new transaction. Compared with the traditional data management technology, blockchain systems are very inefficient. Thus, it is very crucial to improve the blockchain consensus. We present threshold digital signature techniques to exploit the blockchain consensus mechanism. First, we propose a threshold signature scheme based on NP-hard problem, i.e., solving quadratic equations in a finite field, which is considered to be secure against quantum computer attacks and traditional attacks. Second, we further propose an efficient blockchain consensus algorithm based on the new threshold signature scheme. Third, we build a new blockchain system based on the consensus algorithm.

Although the COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated many investors to diversify their investment portfolios to include digital financial assets, the People's Bank of China has not changed its prohibitive position on tokens and cryptocurrencies and even launched a campaign against miners and crypto exchanges. Macau and Taiwan have also prohibited initial coin offerings and the transfer of cryptocurrencies due to the risks of money laundering connected with the citizens of mainland China.

By the end of 2020, a new bull run started, and the prices of several cryptocurrencies reached record-breaking highs. The factors affecting this rise of cryptocurrencies include the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic crisis and the global increase in the inflation rate, as well as the gradual acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrencies by people worldwide. This exploratory research is focused on this last factor, i.e., using cryptocurrency and with it, the associated support of its ecosystem (e.g., mining, staking). A survey was carried out investigating the motivational factors and barriers to investment in cryptocurrency for Czech representatives of Generations Y and Z (18-42 years; n = 468). The geographic scope was nationwide, and quota sampling was used. Notably, this survey was carried out prior to the global COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, and it is thus not affected by the pandemic and its related economic impacts. The article investigates the dependency between the individual motivational factors and barriers from the perspective of the tendency to take risks (using the risk propensity scale), according to gender and representation of Generations Y and Z. The lack of information on this form of investment is considered as the main barrier to investment in cryptocurrency, with respect to sex and generations. Compared to that, a negative experience with investment in cryptocurrency constitutes the most minor barrier. Respondents that have a tendency to take risks are mostly put off by their lack of experience with investment in general. The main motivational factor for investment in cryptocurrency, with respect to sex and generations, is considered to be the speed of increase in cryptocurrency value. On the other hand, the least encouraging factor is the opportunity to use the high volatility of cryptocurrency for speculative trading. Interestingly, this factor mostly encourages respondents that do not have a tendency to take risks. The findings are discussed, along with the presentation of their implications for practice and the directions of further explanatory research.","[Smutny, Zdenek; Sulc, Zdenek] Prague Univ Econ & Business, Fac Informat & Stat, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic; [Lansky, Jan] Univ Finance & Adm, Fac Econ Studies, Estonska 500-3, Prague 10100, Czech Republic","Prague University of Economics & Business; University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic","Smutny, Z (corresponding author), Prague Univ Econ & Business, Fac Informat & Stat, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.","zdenek.smutny@vse.cz; zdenek.sulc@vse.cz; lansky@mail.vsfs.cz","Lansky, Jan/A-3602-2008; Smutny, Zdenek/L-7498-2016","Lansky, Jan/0000-0003-2485-1494; Smutny, Zdenek/0000-0002-6646-2991","Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, Prague University of Economics and Business [IP400040, F4/1/2019]","Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, Prague University of Economics and Business","The paper was processed with support from an institutional fund IP400040 for long-term conceptual development of science and research and internal grant F4/1/2019 at the Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, Prague University of Economics and Business.","","76","3","3","6","25","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-7390","","MATHEMATICS-BASEL","Mathematics","JUL","2021","9","14","","","","","","","1655","10.3390/math9141655","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math9141655","","","22","Mathematics","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Mathematics","TN5TR","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000676297200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The continuously increasing size of this shared state will gradually render its maintenance unaffordable. Our work investigates techniques that minimize the shared state of the distributed ledger, i.e., the in-memory UTxO set. To this end, we follow two directions: a) we propose novel transaction optimization techniques to be followed by wallets, so as to create transactions that reduce the shared state cost and b) propose a novel fee scheme that incentivizes the creation of state-friendly transactions. We devise an abstract ledger model, expressed via a series of algebraic operators, and define the transaction optimization problem of minimizing the shared state; we also propose a multi-layered algorithm that approximates the optimal solution to this problem. Finally, we define the necessary conditions such that a ledger's fee scheme incentivizes proper state management and propose a state efficient fee function for Bitcoin.","[Karakostas, Dimitris; Kiayias, Aggelos] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Karakostas, Dimitris; Karayannidis, Nikos; Kiayias, Aggelos] IOHK, Singapore, Singapore","University of Edinburgh","Karakostas, D (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.;Karakostas, D (corresponding author), IOHK, Singapore, Singapore.","dimitris.karakostas@ed.ac.uk; nikos.karagiannidis@iohk.io; akiayias@inf.ed.ac.uk","",""," [780477]","","This research was partially supported by H2020 project PRIVILEDGE #780477.","","34","1","1","0","0","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-662-64331-0; 978-3-662-64330-3","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2021","12675","","","","","","319","338","","10.1007/978-3-662-64331-0_17","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-64331-0_17","","","20","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS3JS","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000712016200017","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Bitcoin embodies the Nakamoto consensus to reach an agreement about its blockchain ledger. However, the Nakamoto consensus can suffer from selfish mining attacks. Existing studies on selfish mining usually assume that the total mining power is divided into two parts (i.e., honest and selfish), and ignore propagation delay among miners. The assumptions cannot reflect real-world scenarios, in which multiple miners generate blocks at a fixed interval and propagate them with certain delay. Therefore, it is unknown how the practical factors, i.e., multiple miners and propagation delay, can affect selfish mining. In this paper, we explore the impact of multiple miners and propagation delay on selfish mining. First, we propose a new selfish mining strategy that can handle these factors. Second, we design a simulation approach to analyze the performance of the new selfish mining strategy. From our empirical study we observe many interesting findings that can be utilized in combating selfish mining. For example, the blockchain system with a higher orphan rate is more vulnerable to the selfish mining attack.","[Xia, Qing; Dou, Wensheng; Zeng, Jing; Zhang, Fengjun; Wei, Jun; Liang, Geng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Software, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xia, Qing; Dou, Wensheng; Xi, Tong; Wei, Jun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Fengjun; Liang, Geng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Software, State Key Lab Comp Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xi, Tong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Software, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Software, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Engineering, CAS","Xia, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Software, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Xia, Q (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.","xiaqing2018@iscas.ac.cn; wensheng@iscas.ac.cn; xitong@iie.ac.cn; zengjing@iscas.ac.cn; fengjun@iscas.ac.cn; weijun@iscas.ac.cn; lianggeng@iscas.ac.cn","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2020YFC1523203]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20080200]; Blockchain Technology and Application Joint Laboratory, Guiyang Academy of Information Technology (Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences Guiyang Branch)","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Blockchain Technology and Application Joint Laboratory, Guiyang Academy of Information Technology (Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences Guiyang Branch)","This work is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant No. 2020YFC1523203, the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA20080200) and Blockchain Technology and Application Joint Laboratory, Guiyang Academy of Information Technology (Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences Guiyang Branch).","","26","2","2","0","1","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","0730-3157","","978-1-6654-2463-9","P INT COMP SOFTW APP","","","2021","","","","","","","694","703","","10.1109/COMPSAC51774.2021.00101","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/COMPSAC51774.2021.00101","","","10","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS2RI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000706529000090","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A key requirement of practical PoW blockchains is to adapt to mining power variations over time (Bitcoin's total mining power has increased by a 10(14) factor over the decade). In this paper, we consider the design of provably secure parallel-chain protocols which can adapt to such mining power variations. The Bitcoin difficulty adjustment rule adjusts the difficulty target of block mining periodically to get a constant mean inter-block time. While superficially simple, the rule has proved itself to be sophisticated and successfully secure, both in practice and in theory [11, 13]. We show that natural adaptations of the Bitcoin adjustment rule to the parallel-chain case open the door to subtle, but catastrophic safety and liveness breaches. We uncover a meta-design principle that allow us to design variable mining difficulty protocols for three popular PoW blockchain proposals (Prism [3], OHIE [27], Fruitchains [21]) inside a common rubric. The principle has three components: (M1) a pivot chain, based on which blocks in all chains choose difficulty, (M2) a monotonicity condition for referencing pivot chain blocks and (M3) translating additional protocol aspects from using levels (depth) to using difficulty levels. We show that protocols employing a subset of these principles may have catastrophic failures. The security of the designs is also proved using a common rubric - the key technical challenge involves analyzing the interaction between the pivot chain and the other chains, as well as bounding the sudden changes in difficulty target experienced in non-pivot chains.

Because it represents a convenient way of transferring funds, cryptocurrency has become a substitute for traditional money as a modern electronic means of payment that could potentially change the current financial system. In this context, the digital currency market can be assessed in terms of this emerging economic sector, which competes with traditional financial markets. This study analyzes the impact of cryptocurrencies on the function and position of financial markets. It covers the economic situation of the cryptocurrency market, capital market (Standard & Poor's 500 index), commodity market (gold and oil) and currency market (US dollars or euros), which are characterized by descriptive statistics. Our business linkage studies are based on correlation using weekly data for the period January 2017-March 2021. Despite the fact that cryptocurrencies have aroused great interest, this is still an additional small market that does not constitute much competition to traditional financial markets. Until now, stock markets were considered the most risky; cryptocurrency markets can now be considered as such: they offer considerable income but are very unstable.","[Szczepanska-Przekota, Anna] Politech Koszalinska, Ul Maltanska 9, PL-75430 Koszalin, Poland","Koszalin University of Technology","Szczepanska-Przekota, A (corresponding author), Politech Koszalinska, Ul Maltanska 9, PL-75430 Koszalin, Poland.","anna.szczepanska-przekota@tu.koszalin.pl","","","","","","","45","0","0","3","7","INCISIVE MEDIA","LONDON","HAYMARKET HOUSE, 28-29 HAYMARKET, LONDON, SW1Y 4RX, ENGLAND","2047-1238","2047-1246","","J INVEST STRATEG","J.

This paper explores the price-volatility nexus in cryptocurrency markets and investigates the presence of asymmetric volatility effect between uptrend (bull) and downtrend (bear) regimes. The conventional GARCH-class models have shown that in cryptocurrency markets, asymmetric reactions of volatility to returns differ from those of other traditional financial assets. We address this issue from a viewpoint of fractal analysis, which can cover the nonlinear interactions and the selfsimilarity properties widely acknowledged in the field of econophysics. The asymmetric cross-correlations between price and volatility for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC) during the period from June 1, 2016 to December 28, 2020 are investigated using the MF-ADCCA method and quantified via the asymmetric DCCA coefficient. The approaches take into account the nonlinearity and asymmetric multi-fractal scaling properties, providing new insights in investigating the relationships in a dynamical way. We find that cross-correlations are stronger in downtrend markets than in uptrend markets for maturing BTC and ETH. In contrast, for XRP and LTC, inverted reactions are present where cross-correlations are stronger in uptrend markets. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

We analyzed three cryptocurrencies, namely, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, and six oil market shocks, namely, oil price return (OR), oil realized volatility (ORV), oil realized skewness (ORSV), oil supply shocks (OSS), and oil demand shocks [global aggregate demand for industrial commodities (OADS) and crude oil market demand shocks (OSDS)]. The empirical results of the study reveal that OR, ORV, ORSV, and the two types of oil demand shocks (OADS and OSDS) and OSS have negative and positive impacts, respectively, on the long-term volatility of cryptocurrencies. We further gained insights on the economic underpinnings and observed that the ability of the oil market shocks to signal the uncertainty of the macroeconomic environment is clearly the most important source of its negative and significant impact on the volatility of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, an adverse oil market shock increases the attractiveness of cryptocurrencies, as they could provide shelter from sovereign risk and weakness. Overall, our study highlights a clear and comprehensive understanding of the association between the oil market risk and the cryptocurrency volatility dynamic and the possibility for cryptocurrencies to act as a hedge under specific uncertain economic conditions.","[Yin, Libo; Nie, Jing] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shahe Higher Educ Pk, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Han, Liyan] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China","Central University of Finance & Economics; Beihang University","Yin, LB (corresponding author), Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shahe Higher Educ Pk, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.","yinlibowsxbb@126.com","Yin, Libo/AAJ-1976-2021","Yin, Libo/0000-0003-0193-6735","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71671193, 71871234]; Young talents Support Program in Central University of Finance and Economics [QYP 1901]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Young talents Support Program in Central University of Finance and Economics","This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71671193, No. 71871234); the Young talents Support Program in Central University of Finance and Economics (QYP 1901).","","64","11","11","1","23","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1059-0560","1873-8036","","INT REV ECON FINANC","Int.

Financial markets are characterized by the so-called chaos model-data paradox , that is, it is relatively easy to design theoretical dynamic financial models that behave chaotically, but it is hard to find robust evidence of this kind of chaotic behaviour in real dataset. In fact, this paradox has been taken as an evidence that support the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). In this paper we apply new robust computational methods based on statistical procedures to reconstruct the underlying attractor and to estimate the Lyapunov exponents based on the Jacobian neural nets. We have tested nonlinearity and chaos in some digital cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin). The results show strong evidence against EMH supporting the hypothesis that those time series come from an underlying unknown generating process that behave nonlinear and chaotically. This fact points out that a potential explication to the chaos model-data paradox lies in the methods traditionally used in the literature which are not robust and do not have the capability to find chaos in financial time-series data.

For preventing a double-spender from cheating again, it is necessary to trace his e-coins. So full-tracing in compact E-cash system means tracing double-spender and tracing his coins. However, the efficiency problem caused by coin-tracing without TTP (trusted third party) has not been solved. For solving this problem, we introduce a non-standard construction into zero-knowledge proof of payment protocol, which leaks coin information when double-spending but is proven to be perfect zero-knowledge to verifier when spending a coin only once. Therefore, it achieves tracing dishonest users' coins and preserving the anonymity of honest users. Comparing with the existing most efficient method of coin-tracing without TTP, we improve computational complexity from O(k) to O(1) with less storage space. In addition, to improve efficiency and practicality further, batch-spending (spending any number of coins in one operation) and compact-spending (spending all coins in one operation) had been proposed. Based on the non-standard zero-knowledge proof, our scheme provides more efficient batch/compact-spending.

The decentralized and pseudoanonymous nature of cryptocurrencies impose a unique challenge to the investigators. Unlike investigation on fiat currency where banks can be contacted to freeze account, cryptocurrencies do not have a centralized entity that can be contacted. On top of that, studies have shown that using a generic digital forensics methodology to collect and preserve cryptowallets, which often involves imaging and seizing, are ineffective for cryptocurrencies investigation. This is because criminals can recover his seized cryptowallets into other devices and thus continue to make transactions for illegal activities. This defeats the purpose of halting the criminals from conducting further crimes. Hence in this study we propose a methodology for preserving cryptowallets at crime scene. We then conducted evaluation on the methodology by using real case and simulation exercise on different types of cryptowallets. The result shows that our methodology can be used to properly preserve cryptocurrencies evidence. This study aims to identify gaps in cryptocurrencies investigation and address them by proposing a proper methodology.","[Taylor, Sarah K.] CyberSecur Malaysia, Digital Forens Dept, Cyberjaya, Malaysia; [Ariffin, Aswami] CyberSecur Malaysia, Cyber Secur Respons Serv, Cyberjaya, Malaysia; [Ariffin, Khairul Akram Zainol; Abdullah, Siti Norul Huda Sheikh] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Ctr Cyber Secur, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia","Ariffin, A (corresponding author), CyberSecur Malaysia, Cyber Secur Respons Serv, Cyberjaya, Malaysia.","aswami@cybersecurity.my; k.akram@ukm.edu.my; snhsabdullah@ukm.edu.my","Ariffin, Khairul Akram Zainol/AAY-6008-2021; Ariffin, Khairul Akram Zainol/AAM-7761-2020; Sheikh Abdullah, Siti Norul Huda/J-7949-2015","Ariffin, Khairul Akram Zainol/0000-0003-3627-556X; Sheikh Abdullah, Siti Norul Huda/0000-0002-2602-7805","Ministry of Education [FRGS/1/2018/ICT04/UKM/02/3]","Ministry of Education","We would like to acknowledge Ministry of Education on the support given through grant FRGS/1/2018/ICT04/UKM/02/3.","","23","0","0","0","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-1844-7","","","","2021","","","","","","","125","129","","10.1109/CRC50527.2021.9392446","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CRC50527.2021.9392446","","","5","Computer Science, Information Systems","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS0YA","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000685218700022","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The permanence of illicit content inserted in Bitcoin poses a challenge to law enforcement agencies like Interpol, and millions of dollars were lost in buggy smart contracts in Ethereum. A line of research then spawned on redactable blockchains with the aim of solving the problem of redacting illicit contents from both permissioned and permissionless blockchains. However, all the existing proposals follow the build-newchain approach for redactions, and cannot be integrated with existing running blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This work demonstrates that the traditional build-new-chain approach for blockchain redactions is not necessary. We present Reparo (In the Harry Potter universe, 'Reparo' is a spell that repairs objects), a publicly verifiable layer on top of any blockchain to perform repairs, ranging from fixing buggy contracts to removing illicit contents from the chain. We present an efficient instantiation of Reparo over Ethereum (with proof of work based consensus) for repairing smart contract bugs. In this protocol, any Ethereum user may propose a repair and a deliberation process ensues resulting in a decision that complies with the repair policy of the chain and is publicly verifiable. A repair operation (for instance, fixing a bug in a contract) is then performed according to the repair proposal and the state of Ethereum is updated accordingly. Reparo's advantages are multi-fold: (i) Since Reparo follows a layer design, it helps facilitate additional functionalities for Ethereum while maintaining the same provable security guarantees; (ii) Reparo can be easily tailored to different consensus requirements (like proof of stake), does not require heavy cryptographic machinery, and thus, can be integrated with other existing blockchains (such as Bitcoin, Cardano) as well. We evaluate Reparo with Ethereum mainnet and show that the cost of fixing several prominent smart contract bugs is almost negligible.

Blockchain is often associated with bitcoin and finance's domain. But over the last decade, this backend technology to bitcoin has spread its association in almost all domains that we can think of. Further to this, smart contracts are making the blockchain ecosystem better. Other evolving technologies like Internet-of-things, Industrial Internet-ofthings, Cyber physical systems are also making their onset on the global platform. Smart buildings link Internetof-things connectivity, sensors and the cloud to remotely supervise and assure efficient heating- air conditioning, lighting and security systems etc to improve efficiency and overall sustainability. The global buildings sector over the next 40 years is expected to add 230 billion square meters of fresh construction, i.e., adding the equivalent of Paris every week. Thus integrating these technologies right at the onset, before they grow in isolation, is a coveted need today. This paper proposes a prototype to simulate architecture and discusses how blockchain enabled smart buildings can further expedite automation, security and transparency. For an apprehension purpose, the paper focuses on smart contracts enabled repairs and service in smart buildings.","[Tiwari, Anupam; Batra, Usha] GD Goenka Univ, Gurugram 122103, India","GD Goenka University","Tiwari, A (corresponding author), GD Goenka Univ, Gurugram 122103, India.","anupam.tiwari@gdgu.org","TIWARI, ANUPAM/K-3999-2018","TIWARI, ANUPAM/0000-0002-9097-2246","","","","","24","4","4","2","17","DEFENCE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION DOCUMENTATION CENTRE","DELHI","METCALFE HOUSE, DELHI 110054, INDIA","0011-748X","0976-464X","","DEFENCE SCI J","Def.

For example, BFT-inspired protocols such as Algorand(1) tend to be secure in the partially synchronous setting, while longest chain protocols like Bitcoin will normally require stronger synchronicity to be secure. Another fundamental distinction, directly relevant to scalability solutions such as sharding, is whether or not a single untrusted user is able to point to certificates, which provide incontrovertible proof of block confirmation. Algorand produces such certificates, while Bitcoin does not. Are these properties accidental? Or are they inherent consequences of the paradigm of protocol design? Our aim in this paper is to understand what, fundamentally, governs the nature of security for permissionless blockchain protocols. Using the framework developed in [12], we prove general results showing that these questions relate directly to properties of the user selection process, i.e. the method (such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake) which is used to select users with the task of updating state. Our results suffice to establish, for example, that the production of certificates is impossible for proof-of-work protocols, but is automatic for standard forms of proof-of-stake protocols. As a byproduct of our work, we also define a number of security notions and identify the equivalences and inequivalences among them.","[Lewis-Pye, Andrew] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Roughgarden, Tim] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA","University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Columbia University","Lewis-Pye, A (corresponding author), London Sch Econ, London, England.","a.lewis7@lse.ac.uk; tim.roughgarden@gmail.com","","","","","","","18","1","1","3","4","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","","978-1-4503-8454-4","","","","2021","","","","","","","1006","1019","","10.1145/3460120.3484752","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3460120.3484752","","","14","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BS7XR","","Green Accepted, Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000768478301003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Using daily data from 2018 to 2021, we first apply the wavelet power spectrum (WPS) to visualize volatility shifts. In contrast to previous research, we empirically identify the precise COVID-19 outbreak dates for each market using the Perron (1997) breakpoint test. Finally, we employ the bivariate DCC-GARCH model to analyze the connectedness between markets. The findings reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic caused volatility shifts of different intensities for all of the studied markets. Moreover, each return series exhibits one break date, which is specific to each market and corresponds to a distinct COVID-19-related event. Correlations, hedge ratios, and optimal portfolio weights changed significantly after the COVID-19 outbreak. There is evidence of contagion effects between the Chinese stock market and S&P 500, Euro STOXX 50, gold, and silver. Interestingly, the latter two assets lost their safe haven property with SSE.

In physics, the Schwarzschild radius indicates that black holes are constantly expanding because of their mass increase. Enriching this analogy, we consider the cryptocurrency market as a self-gravitational body whose mass is denoted by (1) the number of traded cryptocurrencies and (2) in terms of increasing market capitalization for a given number of traded cryptocurrencies. By analyzing weekly snapshot data of all traded cryptocurrencies from January 4, 2009, to June 14, 2020, we find evidence that the above-mentioned mechanism exists. The results clearly indicate the self-gravitational property of the cryptocurrency market, which is direct evidence toward the hypothesis that the changes in the traded cryptocurrencies are a positive function of the previous period's number of traded cryptocurrencies.","[Ballis, Antonis; Drakos, Konstantinos] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Sch Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, 76 Patission St, Athens 10434, Greece","Athens University of Economics & Business","Ballis, A (corresponding author), Athens Univ Econ & Business, Sch Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, 76 Patission St, Athens 10434, Greece.","aballis@aueb.gr","Ballis, Antonis/D-4527-2019","Ballis, Antonis/0000-0002-3033-3290","European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) through the Operational Programme Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning [MIS-5000432]","European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) through the Operational Programme Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning","This research is co-financed by Greece and the European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) through the Operational Programme Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning in the context of the project Strengthening Human Resources Research Potential via Doctorate Research (MIS-5000432), implemented by the State Scholarships Foundation (IKY).","","30","1","1","2","19","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","2199-4730","","FINANC INNOV","Financ.

Consequently, the application of this technology to the management domain and its processes has attracted increasing interest from academia and industry. Although research addressing the use of blockchain in management has gained momentum, this field presents a discontinuous overview of the current scope and boundary of the knowledge thereon. This study addresses this lacuna using bibliometric analyses to synthesize the prior literature. Data from Scopus 586 articles, entailing contributions from 72 countries, 273 journals, 1016 organizations, and 1284 authors, were analyzed. The findings indicate a maturing research focus on blockchain applications in specific managerial sectors, such as finance and supply chain management. However, this field?s conceptual evolution is posited to be in its infancy in other sectors, such as for managing luxury goods and counterfeit products. Further, the thematic classification of the extant literature led to the identification of the following four major themes of research: strategy and regulation, enablement and implication, multi-domain deployment, and the inefficiencies of bitcoin. These findings are used to propose directions for further research in this field, such as the need for methodological advancement and theoretical grounding.","[Tandon, Anushree; Mantymaki, Matti] Univ Turku, Turku Sch Econ, Turku, Finland; [Kaur, Puneet] Univ Bergen, Dept Psychosocial Sci, Bergen, Norway; [Kaur, Puneet; Dhir, Amandeep] North West Univ, Optentia Res Focus Area, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa; [Dhir, Amandeep] Univ Agder, Sch Business & Law, Dept Management, Kristiansand, Norway; [Dhir, Amandeep] Norwegian Sch Hotel Management, Fac Social Sci, Stavanger, Norway","University of Turku; University of Bergen; North West University - South Africa; University of Agder; Universitetet i Stavanger","Dhir, A (corresponding author), Univ Agder, Sch Business & Law, Dept Management, Kristiansand, Norway.","anushree.tandon@utu.fi; puneet.kaur@uib.no; matti.mantymaki@utu.fi; amandeep.dhir@uia.no","tandon, anushree/AAP-8057-2020; Dhir, Amandeep/F-1826-2013","tandon, anushree/0000-0002-7319-418X; Dhir, Amandeep/0000-0002-6006-6058; Kaur, Puneet/0000-0002-8309-8888; Mantymaki, Matti/0000-0002-1981-566X","","","","","112","46","45","48","185","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","0040-1625","1873-5509","","TECHNOL FORECAST SOC","Technol.

The sample period covers the first and second devasting waves of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and ranges from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. The dynamic return and volatility connectedness measures are estimated using the time varying parameter-VAR approach. Our return connectedness analysis shows that the media coverage index (only before the first wave) and the cryp-tocurrencies are the net transmitters of shocks while the fiat currencies are the net receivers of shocks. Similar results are obtained in terms of volatility, except for the euro, which shows a clear net receiver profile in January and February. This fiat currency (the euro) became a net transmitter in March and during the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis, which possibly shows the virulence of the pandemic on the European continent. Moreover, the most relevant differences between the net dynamic (return and volatility) connectedness of these two groups of currencies are focused on the beginning of the sample period, just before the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic crisis, although some differences are observed during the first and second waves of the coronavirus outbreak.","[Umar, Zaghum] Zayed Univ, Coll Business, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Jareno, Francisco; de la O Gonzalez, Maria] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Albacete, Spain; [Umar, Zaghum] South Ural State Univ, Lenin Prospect 76, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia","Zayed University; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; South Ural State University","Jareno, F (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Albacete, Spain.","zaghum.umar@gmail.com; Francisco.Jareno@uclm.es; MariaO.Gonzalez@uclm.es","Jareno, Francisco/L-7645-2014","Jareno, Francisco/0000-0001-9778-7345; Umar, Zaghum/0000-0002-0425-2665","Spanish Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad [ECO2017-89715-P]","Spanish Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad(Spanish Government)","This work was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad (ECO2017-89715-P)","","70","21","21","1","13","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","0040-1625","1873-5509","","TECHNOL FORECAST SOC","Technol.

Nodes in the network can be users, machines, and so on. Using the sensing detection technology of the IIoT, industrial machines can realize real-time informatization, which is convenient for users to perform remote management. Nodes can communicate with each other and make ratings. These ratings can be modeled as directed weighted edges between nodes and form directed weighted networks (DWNs). The edge weight represents the strength of relationship and the direction of edge points from the edge generator to the edge receiver. Predicting edge weights in DWNs is critical to predicting unknown ratings or recovering lost data. In this article, we propose a directed edge weight prediction model (DEWP) using decision tree ensembles. It extends the local similarity indices to DWNs and extracts a series of similarity indices between nodes as features of each edge. These features are used to construct a blended regression model of random forest, gradient boost decision tree, extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting machine. The proposed algorithm was evaluated experimentally with the Bitcoin OTC and Bitcoin Alpha datasets by removing 10% to 90% of edges in the original network. Compared with other classical algorithms, DEWP has higher prediction accuracy and robustness.","[Qiu, Tie] Tianjin Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Coll Intelligence & Comp, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Tie; Zhang, Min; Liu, Xize] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Software, Dalian 116620, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jing] Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Tianjin 300401, Peoples R China; [Chen, Chen] Xidian Univ, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks, Xian 710071, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Wenbing] Cleveland State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA","Tianjin University; Dalian University of Technology; Hebei University of Technology; Xidian University; University System of Ohio; Cleveland State University","Qiu, T (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Coll Intelligence & Comp, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China.;Liu, J (corresponding author), Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Tianjin 300401, Peoples R China.","qiutie@ieee.org; zhangminemail@126.com; liuxize@mail.dlut.edu.cn; liujing@scce.hebut.edu.cn; cc2000@mail.xidian.edu.cn; wenbing@ieee.org","Zhao, Wenbing/H-5498-2019","Zhao, Wenbing/0000-0002-3202-1127; Qiu, Tie/0000-0003-2324-2523","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61672131]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFB1703601]; Tianjin Science and Technology Projects [18YFCZZC00060, 18ZXZNGX00100]; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province [F2019202062]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Tianjin Science and Technology Projects; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61672131, in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2019YFB1703601, in part by Tianjin Science and Technology Projects 18YFCZZC00060 and 18ZXZNGX00100, and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province under F2019202062.","","29","6","6","6","55","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","1551-3203","1941-0050","","IEEE T IND INFORM","IEEE Trans.

The in-depth analysis involve: (1) alternative econometric techniques and data frequencies, (2) use of country-specific economic policy uncertainty indices to complement the global index, (3) distinct analysis for the COVID-19 first wave period due to extant argument that the pandemic raise market uncertainties and our preliminary results showing co-movement among the three uncertainty indicators during the pandemic.

There are many consensus algorithms used in different cryptocurrencies to provide security for transactions in the blockchain. Along with the consensus algorithm, the blockchain structure is also an important aspect that affects the performance of the cryptocurrency. However, most of the state-of-the-art schemes have some serious concern for scalability issues such as less throughput, high consensus delay, and high block interval time. The consensus algorithm and structure of blockchain have direct implications on these performance parameters. Therefore, we proposed a scheme called BlockTree, a sharding-based secure, scalable, and decentralized ledger scheme. Unlike Bitcoin, BlockTree is a nonlinear data structure based scheme, which partitioned the miners with fixed group size whenever the number of miners becomes more than the set limit called m, and the blockchain is forked from that instance. Due to this partitioning, the BlockTree supports the parallel execution of the transaction, which has improved the throughput and consensus delay while keeping the high level of security. The BlockTree used the leader selection algorithm to select a leader and the data block verification algorithm to reach consensus among miners on the next set of the transactions to append blocks in the blockchain. The BlockTree is analyzed based on real-world parameters such as throughput, consensus delay, different block sizes, block generation intervals, and network propagation compared to existing technologies.","[Vishwakarma, Lokendra; Das, Debasis] Indian Inst Technol, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India","Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Jodhpur","Das, D (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India.","vishwakarma.3@iitj.ac.in; debasis@iitj.ac.in","","Das, Debasis/0000-0001-6205-4096; Vishwakarma, Lokendra/0000-0001-5170-9501","SEED Grant from the Indian Institute of Technology(IIT) Jodhpur, India [I/SEED/DDS/20200032]","SEED Grant from the Indian Institute of Technology(IIT) Jodhpur, India","The authors were funded by SEED Grant from the Indian Institute of Technology(IIT) Jodhpur, India, fully supports this work (Project Number: I/SEED/DDS/20200032).","","44","0","0","0","1","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1386-7857","1573-7543","","CLUSTER COMPUT","Cluster Comput.","DEC","2021","24","4","","","","","3751","3765","","10.1007/s10586-021-03366-5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10586-021-03366-5","","JUL 2021","15","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science","WP2TO","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000679776800001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Green Energy means renewable and zeroes hazardous gas emissions that pollute the atmosphere to produce energy such as CO2. The main sources of Green Energy are Wind, Hydro and Solar. The integration of these clean energy resources with the emerging Microgrid technology made researchers expect that it will reduce the main grid's burden and help reduce carbon emissions. However, their integration makes the energy control system more complex. To provide clean and pollution-free energy to end users/buyers, it must be free and saved from cyber theft. Therefore, this paper proposed a Blockchain Technique to resolve above discussed issues. The green energy model used for analysis in our system fulfills the green energy rules.","[Ahmed, Mishaal] Univ Technol & Management, Dept Comp Engn, Lahore, Pakistan; [Farooq, M.

Traditional IoT architecture is heavily centralized, where data stored in a cloud environment is prone to several kinds of threats. As such, both data generated by sensors as well as IoT network shall be protected. Blockchain is an emerging technology that can be used in a wide spectrum of applications for better protection. However, the traditional blockchain protocol for Bitcoin cannot be used for IoT data protection because Bitcoin is a payment system, and the IoT ecosystem has a different architecture and requirements. Hence, more suitable blockchain architecture and encryption schemes for IoT are needed. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving blockchain architecture for IoT using Hierarchical Identity Based Encryption (HIBE). The proposed architecture fits well with event-driven IoT devices and uses the edge and the cloudlet computing paradigm as well as HIBE to preserve the privacy. Furthermore, the efficiency of the proposed architecture is demonstrated using a real-life case, namely, traffic speed radars. The security of the proposed architecture is analyzed and is verified through theoretical analysis that considers the existence of a malicious adversary. The performance of the proposed architecture is evaluated by conducting extensive experiments using the Contiki OS. The experimental results provide the system and network performance of the proposed architecture.","[Pavithran, Deepa] Abu Dhabi Polytech, Informat Secur Engn Dept, POB 111499, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Al-Karaki, Jamal N.] Higher Coll Technol, Comp Informat Syst, POB 25026, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Al-Karaki, Jamal N.] Hashemite Univ, Dept Comp Engn, POB 330127, Zarqa 13133, Jordan; [Shaalan, Khaled] British Univ Dubai, POB 345015, Dubai, U Arab Emirates","Higher Colleges of Technology - United Arab Emirates; Hashemite University","Pavithran, D (corresponding author), Abu Dhabi Polytech, Informat Secur Engn Dept, POB 111499, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.","deepa.pavithran@gmail.com","","Pavithran, Deepa/0000-0002-8271-3770","","","","","47","10","10","6","54","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0306-4573","1873-5371","","INFORM PROCESS MANAG","Inf.

Although various blockchain-based solutions were created, the lack of tools to evaluate these complex distributed systems may hinder the development of the field. Many advantages of blockchain systems can be demonstrated only at large scales, e.g., using thousands of nodes. An investigation of different implementations and design choices is complicated and hardly feasible on real systems. Meanwhile, blockchain simulators give the possibility to repeat the complex real-world processes at a low cost. This work provides the first and an up-to-date systematic review and empirical analysis of blockchain simulators. Simulators are easily extensible and can test the performance of distributed ledgers using different settings and parameters on a single computer. The features and limitations of selected simulators are summarized and experimentally validated. Finally, recommendations for potential future research directions in the field are provided.","[Paulavicius, Remigijus; Grigaitis, Saulius; Filatovas, Ernestas] Vilnius Univ, Inst Data Sci & Digital Technol, LT-08412 Vilnius, Lithuania","Vilnius University","Paulavicius, R (corresponding author), Vilnius Univ, Inst Data Sci & Digital Technol, LT-08412 Vilnius, Lithuania.","remigijus.paulavicius@mif.vu.lt","Paulavicius, Remigijus/I-4302-2013; Filatovas, Ernestas/H-7721-2015","Paulavicius, Remigijus/0000-0003-2057-2922; Filatovas, Ernestas/0000-0002-9329-6431","","","","","74","9","9","2","11","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2021","9","","","","","","38010","38028","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3063324","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3063324","","","19","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","QW9JA","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000628962300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, a deviation to this behavior is the selfish mining strategy, an attack vector discovered by Eyal and Sirer in 2014. This strategy may lead to a miner earning more than their fair share. As a result, Bitcoin's security assumption of an honest majority may not be sufficient. In this paper, in order to verify whether selfish mining is indeed a profitable strategy in PoW systems, we introduce an agent-based model to simulate the dynamics of selfish mining behavior. The model is by design minimalistic allowing us to analyze the effect of network latency, hashing power distribution, and network topology on relative revenue of selfish miners. We find that for high levels of latency, selfish mining is always a relatively more profitable strategy, and the results turn out to be very robust to changes in the network topology. In addition, we find that the hashing power distribution following power laws, as found empirically, can make it harder for selfish miners to be profitable. Our analysis confirms the main observations that selfish mining is always relatively more profitable for hashing powers representing more than one third of the total computing power. Further, it also confirms that selfish mining behavior could cause a statistically significant high probability of contiguously mined blocks.","[Schwarz-Schilling, Caspar] Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Li, Sheng-Nan] Univ Zurich, URPP Social Networks, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Tessone, Claudio J.] Univ Zurich, URPP Social Networks, UZH Blockchain Ctr, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland","University of Zurich; University of Zurich; University of Zurich","Li, SN (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, URPP Social Networks, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.","caspar.schwarz-schilling@uzh.ch; shengnan.li@uzh.ch; claudio.tessone@uzh.ch","","Tessone, Claudio J./0000-0001-7733-6221; Li, Sheng-Nan/0000-0002-2305-3186","","","","","19","2","2","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-2182-9","","","","2021","","","","","","","111","118","","10.1109/BCCA53669.2021.9657011","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BCCA53669.2021.9657011","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7HP","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000848651400015","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Some policymakers and scholars warn that regulation will cause trading activity to cross borders into less-regulated jurisdictions oreven smother a promising new financial asset class. Others believe regulatory actions will stimulate activity by provi ding clarity to market participants. Standing behind this disagreement is a debate about the desirability of either outcome. Some believe that governments should promote development of the cryptocurrency sector within their countries, while others view cryptocurrencies as conduits of illegality and fraud that should be restricted through strict regulation or even outright bans. Yet these debates have, to date, been conducted almost entirely without data concerning the effects of regulation on market activity. As a corrective, in this article we assembled original data on cryptocurrency regulations worldwide and used them to empirically examine movement in trading activity at a number of exchanges following key regulatory announcements. We found that a wide variety of models yielded almost entirely null results. From the creation of bespoke licensing regimes to targeted anti money-laundering and anti-fraud enforcement actions, as well as many other categories of government activities, we found no systemic evidence that regulatory measures cause traders to flee, or enter into, the affected jurisdictions. These findings at last provide an empirical basis for regulatory decisions concerning cryptocurrency trading. Among other things, they call into question that capital flight or chilling effects should be a first-order concern.","[Feinstein, Brian D.; Werbach, Kevin] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Legal Studies & Business Eth, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","University of Pennsylvania","Feinstein, BD (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Legal Studies & Business Eth, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.","bdfeinst@wharton.upenn.edu; werbach@wharton.upenn.edu","","","","","","","114","5","5","2","5","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","2053-4833","2053-4841","","J FINANC REGUL","J.

The solution to improve transaction balance anonymity of blockchain cryptocurrencies based on Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) paradigm is presented. Transferred money sums are hidden by discrete exponent function (DEF). Then due to isomorphism property of DEF, hidden UTXO balance is computed and this balance can be approved by the validators in this hidden form. The security is based on the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) complexity. Cryptocurrencies are circulating in the peer-to-peer network and data can be represented by the vectors in certain linear space as it is in the general peer-to-peer network of nodes. To avoid pollution attacks and improve robustness of these general networks the signature based on idea to sign a linear subspace of transferred data for general content distribution among the nodes is created. The same idea is used in our proposed UTXO transactions anonymity improvement. Since transaction data composing a balance is represented by the vectors spanning certain linear subspace of some linear space, then this subspace is digitally signed by one-time (session) signature based on one-time (session) private and public keys generation. According to the original literature source the security of this signature relies on the DLP complexity.","[Sakalauskas, Eligijus] Kauno Kolegija Univ Appl Sci, Dept Appl Math, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44249 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Kilciauskas, Ausrys] Kauno Kolegija Univ Appl Sci, Dept Informat, Pramones Pr 20, LT-50468 Kaunas, Lithuania","Kaunas University of Applied Engineering Sciences; Kaunas University of Applied Engineering Sciences","Sakalauskas, E (corresponding author), Kauno Kolegija Univ Appl Sci, Dept Appl Math, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44249 Kaunas, Lithuania.","eligijus.sakalauskas@ktu.lt; ausrys.kilciauskas@go.kauko.lt","","","","","","","5","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","1865-0929","1865-0937","978-3-030-88304-1; 978-3-030-88303-4","COMM COM INF SC","","","2021","1486","","","","","","160","168","","10.1007/978-3-030-88304-1_13","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-88304-1_13","","","9","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BU0IK","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000869711400013","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This paper aims to study the impact of COVID-19 on the time-frequency connectedness between Green Bonds and other financial assets. Our sample includes the global stock market, bond market, oil, USD index, and two popular hedging alternatives, namely Gold and Bitcoin, from May 2013 to August 2020. First, we apply the methodologies of Diebold and Yilmaz (International Journal of Forecasting, 2012, 28(1), 57-66) and Barunk and Krehlk (Journal of Financial Econometrics, 2018, 16(2), 271-296). Then, we estimate hedge ratios and hedge effectiveness of green bonds for other financial assets. Green bonds are found to have a great weight in the overall network, particularly strongly connected with the USD index and bond index. While the bi-directional relationship with USD persists during COVID, the connectedness with conventional bonds is also strengthened. Notably, we find a weak relationship between Green bonds and Bitcoin, both in the short and long run. As portfolio implications, Gold and USD have the highest hedge ratio, which is confirmed by the hedging effectiveness. In contrast, oil and stocks exhibit the lowest hedging effectiveness. Our findings imply that financial assets might have a heterogeneous relationship with green bonds. Furthermore, despite its infancy, it seems that the role of green bond during a crisis should not be ignored, as it can be a hedger for some assets, while a contagion amplifier during crisis times.","[Naeem, Muhammad Abubakr] Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Coll Business, Albany, Ireland; [Naeem, Muhammad Abubakr] ILMA Univ, Dept Business Adm, Fac Management Sci, Karach, Pakistan; [Mbarki, Imen; Omri, Abdelwahed] Univ Tunis, Higher Inst Management Tunis, Finance & Accounting Dept, GEF2A Lab, Tunis, Tunisia; [Alharthi, Majed] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Business, Rabigh, Saudi Arabia; [Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain] Montpellier Business Sch, Finance Control & Law, Montpellier, France; [Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain] South Ural State Univ, Dept Accounting Anal & Audit, Chelyabinsk, Russia","University College Dublin; Universite de la Manouba; Universite de Tunis; King Abdulaziz University; Montpellier Business School; South Ural State University","Naeem, MA (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Coll Business, Albany, Ireland.;Naeem, MA (corresponding author), ILMA Univ, Dept Business Adm, Fac Management Sci, Karach, Pakistan.","m.ab.naeem@gmail.com","","","Science Foundation Ireland [16/SPP/3347]","Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation IrelandEuropean Commission)","MN gratefully acknowledges the support of Science Foundation Ireland under grant number 16/SPP/3347.","","65","21","21","16","45","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","2296-665X","","FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ","Front.

However, many criminal activities might be committed with the protection of anonymity in cryptocurrency transactions. Thus, user accountability (or traceability) is also important in Monero transactions, which is unfortunately lacking in the current literature. In this paper, we fill this gap by introducing a new cryptocurrency named Traceable Monero to balance the user anonymity and accountability. Our framework relies on a tracing authority, but is optimistic, in that it is only involved when investigations in certain transactions are required. We formalize the system model and security model of Traceable Monero. We present a detailed construction of Traceable Monero by overlaying Monero with two types of tracing mechanisms, tracing the one-time addresses with money flows and tracing the long-term addresses.

Blockchain is a new technology based on the distributed digital ledger system. Decentralized trust is one of the key factors behind the blockchain-based system. Transparency of such a system is better than a conventional centralized ledger system. By using a blockchainbased transaction system, any business organization can harness key benefits like data integrity, confidentiality, and anonymity without involving any third party in control of the transactions. Since the blockchain is used in numerous applications and the horizon is expanding at an unprecedented pace. So, there is a need for an introducing and reviewing of blockchain platforms. In this paper, we have reported a review on existing contemporary blockchain platforms. In particular, From the existing studies, we have identified eighty blockchain platforms and the majority of them have a lack of technical details. To provide the researchers a comprehensive introducing on blockchain platforms to perform a broad guideline for future research and investment in the blockchain domain.","[Alrumaih, Malak Suliman] Qassim Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Burydah, Saudi Arabia","Qassim University","Alrumaih, MS (corresponding author), Qassim Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Burydah, Saudi Arabia.","","","","","","","","79","0","0","7","13","INT JOURNAL COMPUTER SCIENCE & NETWORK SECURITY-IJCSNS","SEOUL","DAE-SANG OFFICE 301, SANGDO 5 DONG 509-1, SEOUL, 00000, SOUTH KOREA","1738-7906","","","INT J COMPUT SCI NET","Int.

In addition, this paper aims to find an answer to the question to what extent the measures of the fifth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD) as well as other appropriate preventive measures are sufficient to reduce the money laundering risk in the area of virtual currencies (VC). Design/methodology/approach Firstly, the analysis requires a consideration of the theoretical foundations of money laundering methods, as well as a presentation of the technical foundations of cryptocurrencies and their ecosystem. Secondly, it is discussed to what extent VC are suitable for money laundering, which characteristics enable them to launder money and which new money laundering techniques result from this. In addition, a comparison of different money laundering risk classification is done in relation to VC from the perspective of different actors in the financial market. Findings Owing to their simple electronic storage and transferability, crypto assets pose a concrete risk of money laundering. Their inclusion in the fifth AMLD was therefore a necessary step by the European legislator. However, the question arises to whether the directive and the further preventive measures presented in this paper sufficiently fulfil the objective of reducing the money laundering risk in relation to VC. One positive aspect is the inclusion of the crypto custody business as a financial service in the German Banking Act. According to the definition in Section 1 (1a) sentence 2 no. 6, the offering of wallets is subject to authorization and the offering party becomes an obligated party within the meaning of the Germany Money Laundering Act. From a supervisory point of view, the new licensing requirement is very much welcomed, as the custody of private cryptographic keys entails considerable risks. However, non-custodian wallet providers who do not store the private keys of their users, are not covered. A closer analysis of the amending directive to the fourth EU AMLD reveals that other relevant players in the crypto market, such as mixer and tumbler services, are also not covered. Originality/value It is quite clear that cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology will continue to accompany one in the coming years. Further credit institutions arising in the market exposed to the described risks will be seen. The paper will therefore present and evaluate possible risk reduction/options for anti-money laundering for new and existing financial institutions.","[Wronka, Christoph] Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprufungsgesell, Frankfurt, Germany","","Wronka, C (corresponding author), Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprufungsgesell, Frankfurt, Germany.","cwronka@deloitte.de","","","","","","","25","2","2","9","38","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1758-7808","1368-5201","","J MONEY LAUND CONTRO","J.

On the basis of a review of the available literature and evidence, it is clear that certain technological innovations, such as the movement towards electronic money, will undoubtedly change how we operate. However, the conclusion in this paper is less sanguine regarding the prospects of a global currency, regional monetary unions, or states' exit from or central banks' control of money. This paper also sees poor prospects for cryptocurrencies at the moment, given their focus on the decentralisation and politicisation of money, because money requires a backstopping force, making it inherently political. Finally, this paper considers how regulators may seek to ensure that money in its digital form is not taken advantage of and applied in malevolent activities. The study used correlation to establish the level of association among variables. A multiple regression analysis was used to draw an econometric model explaining the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The following variables were used as independent variables: monetary aggregate (M1), harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), US dollar/euro, and the USD value of Bitcoin. Multiple regression predicted that when inflation rises, the money supply will decrease. M1 includes cash in circulation, current deposits, and other than demand deposits. The study concludes that price increases encourage people to keep their money in longer-term deposits, including in cryptocurrency. Additionally, an increase in EURIBOR and US dollar/euro reduces the supply of money. Otherwise, an increase in the price of bitcoin in the economy would increase the overall money supply.","[Ogachi, Daniel] Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Doctoral Sch Econ & Reg Sci, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary; [Mugambi, Paul] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Doctoral Sch Int Relat & Polit Sci, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Bares, Lydia] Univ Cadiz, Dept Gen Econ, Cadiz 11002, Spain; [Zeman, Zoltan] Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, GTK Inst Finance Accounting & Controlling, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary","Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; Corvinus University Budapest; Universidad de Cadiz; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences","Ogachi, D (corresponding author), Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Doctoral Sch Econ & Reg Sci, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary.","ogachdniel@gmail.com; pmugambi@ict.go.ke; lydia.bares@uca.es; zeman.zoltan@gtk.szie.hu","Zéman, Zoltán/ACG-7168-2022; Ogachi, Dr Daniel/GQH-6316-2022; BARES LOPEZ, LYDIA/N-7836-2015","Zéman, Zoltán/0000-0003-2504-028X; Ogachi, Dr. Daniel/0000-0003-1740-5808; Mugambi Makunyi, Paul/0000-0003-2699-8481; BARES LOPEZ, LYDIA/0000-0001-6026-6570","Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Science","Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Science","This research was fully funded by the Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Science.","","49","1","1","6","21","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-7099","","ECONOMIES","Economies","MAR","2021","9","1","","","","","","","40","10.3390/economies9010040","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/economies9010040","","","19","Economics","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Business & Economics","RC9CF","","Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000633089100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In the case of Bitcoin, mining involves a process of packing transactions in a block by calculating a random number termed as a nonce. The nonce calculation is done by special nodes called miners, and all the miners follow the Proof of Work (PoW) mining mechanism to perform the mining task. The transaction verification time in PoW-based blockchain systems, i.e., Bitcoin, is much slower than other digital transaction systems such as PayPal. It needs to be quicker if a system adapts PoW-based blockchain solutions, where there are thousands of transactions being computed at a time. Besides this, PoW mining also consumes a lot of energy to calculate the nonce of a block. Mining pools resulting into aggregated hashpower have been a popular solution to speed up the PoW mining, but they can be attacked by using different types of attacks. Parallel computing can be used to speed up the solo mining methods by utilizing the multiple processes of the contributing processors. In this research, we analyze various consensus mechanisms and see that the PoW-based blockchain systems have the limitations of low transaction confirmation time and high energy consumption. We also analyze various types of consensus layer attacks and their effects on miners and mining pools. To tackle these issues, we propose parallel PoW nonce calculation methods to accelerate the transaction verification process especially in solo mining. We have tested our techniques on different difficulty levels, and our proposed techniques yield better results than the traditional nonce computation mechanisms.","[Raza, Zeeshan; ul Haq, Irfan; Muneeb, Muhammad] Pakistan Inst Engn & Appl Sci PIEAS, Dept Comp & Informat Sci DCIS, Islamabad 45650, Pakistan; [Shafiq, Omair] Carleton Univ, Sch Informat Technol, Carleton, ON, Canada","Pakistan Institute of Engineering & Applied Science; Carleton University","Raza, Z (corresponding author), Pakistan Inst Engn & Appl Sci PIEAS, Dept Comp & Informat Sci DCIS, Islamabad 45650, Pakistan.","zeeshan.raza@yahoo.com; irfanulhaq@pieas.edu.pk; muneebsiddique007@gmail.com; omairshafiq@cunet.carleton.ca","Muneeb, Muhammad/AAH-4444-2021","Muneeb, Muhammad/0000-0002-6506-4430; Raza, Zeeshan/0000-0002-4354-4062; Haq, Irfan/0000-0002-5142-3965","","","","","63","0","0","2","4","HINDAWI LTD","LONDON","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","1058-9244","1875-919X","","SCI PROGRAMMING-NETH","Sci.

Data manipulation is a serious threat to data integrity which can occur in cloud computing - a relatively new offering under the umbrella of cloud services. Data can be tampered with, and malicious actors could use this to their advantage. Cloud computing clients in various application domains want to be assured that their data is accurate and trustworthy. On another spectrum, blockchain is a tamper-proof digital ledger that can be used alongside cloud technology to provide a tamper-proof cloud computing environment. This paper proposes a scheme that combines cloud computing with blockchain that assures data integrity for all homomorphic encryption schemes. To overcome the cloud service provider's (CSP) ultimate authority over the data, the proposed scheme relies on the Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus to build a distributed network of processing CSPs based on the client requirements. After certain computations performed by all CSPs, they produce a master hash value for their database. To ensure immutable data is produced, master hash values are preserved in Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain networks. The master hash values can be obtained by tracking the block header address for verification purposes. A theoretical analysis of the overhead costs associated with creating master hash values for each of the cryptocurrencies is presented. We found that Ethereum leads to lower client financial costs and better online performance than Bitcoin. We also specify the data security requirements the proposed scheme provides, the ground-level implementation, and future work. The proposed verification scheme is based on public cryptocurrency as a back-end service and does not require additional setup actions by the client other than a wallet for the chosen cryptocurrency.","[Awadallah, Ruba; Samsudin, Azman; Teh, Je Sen; Almazrooie, Mishal] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Comp Sci, George Town 11800, Malaysia","Universiti Sains Malaysia","Awadallah, R; Samsudin, A (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Comp Sci, George Town 11800, Malaysia.","awadallah.rn@gmail.com; azman.samsudin@usm.my","Samsudin, Azman/AAV-4902-2021; Teh, Je Sen/B-7368-2018","Awadallah, Ruba/0000-0002-3007-142X; Samsudin, Azman/0000-0001-9981-7958; Teh, Je Sen/0000-0001-5571-4148","Universiti Sains Malaysia [LRGS/MRUN: 203]","Universiti Sains Malaysia(Universiti Sains Malaysia)","This work was supported in part by the Universiti Sains Malaysia under Grant LRGS/MRUN: 203.PKOMP.6777005.","","72","4","4","7","19","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2021","9","","","","","","69513","69526","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3077123","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3077123","","","14","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","SC1RH","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000650457100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Existing systems primarily divide the reward in proportion to expended resources and follow one of two static models for total block reward: (i) a fixed reward for each block (e.g., Ethereum), or (ii) one where the block reward halves every set number of blocks (e.g., the Bitcoin model of halving roughly every 4 years) but otherwise remains fixed between halvings. In recent work, a game-theoretic analysis of the static model under asymmetric miner costs showed that an equilibrium always exists and is unique [4]. Their analysis also reveals how asymmetric costs can lead to large-scale centralization in blockchain mining, a phenomenon that has been observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum and highlighted by other studies including [11, 16]. In this work we introduce a novel family of mining reward functions, Ha PPY-Mine (HAsh-Pegged Proportional Yield), which peg the value of the reward to the hashrate of the system, decreasing the reward as the hashrate increases. HaPPY-Mine distributes rewards in proportion to expended hashrate and inherits the safety properties of the generalized proportional reward function established in [9]. We study HaPPY-Mine under a heterogeneous miner cost model and show that an equilibrium always exists with a unique set of miner participants and a unique total hashrate. Significantly, we prove that a HaPPY-Mine equilibrium is more decentralized than the static model equilibrium under a set of metrics including number of mining participants and hashrate distribution. Finally, we show that any Ha PPY-Mine equilibrium is also safe against collusion and sybil attacks, and explore how the market value of the currency affects the equilibrium.","[Kiffer, Lucianna; Rajaraman, Rajmohan] Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Northeastern University","Kiffer, L (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA.","lkiffer@ccs.neu.edu; rraj@ccs.neu.edu","","","Facebook Fellowship; Dfinity Scholarship; NSF [CCF-1909363]","Facebook Fellowship(Facebook Inc); Dfinity Scholarship; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We thank the anonymous reviewers and Yonatan Sompolinsky for their helpful comments.

Under the assumption that the cryptocurrency market has unobserved heterogeneity, an HMM allows us to study (1) the extent to which cryptocurrency markets shift due to interactions with social sentiment during a bull or bear market and (2) the heterogeneous pattern of cryptocurrency market behavior under these two market conditions. Design/methodology/approach The authors advance the HMM model based on two six-month datasets (from November 2017 to April 2018 for a bull market and from December 2018 to May 2019 for a bear market) collected from Google, Twitter, the stock market and cryptocurrency trading platforms in South Korea. Social sentiment data were collected by crawling Bitcoin-related posts on Twitter. Findings The authors highlight the reaction of the cryptocurrency market to social sentiment under a bull and a bear market and in two hidden states (an upward and a downward trend). They find: (1) social sentiment is relatively relevant during a bull compared to a bear market. (2) The cryptocurrency market in a downward state, that is, with a local decreasing trend, tends to be more responsive to positive social sentiment. (3) The market in an upward state, that is, with a local increasing trend, tends to better interact with negative social sentiment. Originality/value The proposed HMM model contributes to a theoretically grounded understanding of how cryptocurrency markets respond to social sentiment in bull and bear markets through varied sequences adjusted for cryptocurrency market heterogeneity.","[Kim, Kwansoo; Assar, Said] Inst Mines Telecom, Dept Technol Informat & Management, Paris, France; [Lee, Sang-Yong Tom] Hanyang Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea","IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; IMT Atlantique; Hanyang University","Lee, SYT (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea.","tomlee@hanyang.ac.kr","Assar, Said/A-2228-2009","Assar, Said/0000-0001-8040-5865; Lee, Sang-Yong Tom/0000-0002-1937-3144","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2020S1A3A2A02093277]","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2020S1A3A2A02093277).","","105","0","0","7","20","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","0263-5577","1758-5783","","IND MANAGE DATA SYST","Ind.

Instead, mining pools as a financial innovation escalate miners' arms race and significantly increase the energy consumption of proof-of-work-based blockchains.

The results of DY suggest that, first, the total connectedness of 21st century technology assets and traditional common stocks is very high, and hence in the turbulent economy, there is a high probability of contemporaneous losses. Second, Bitcoin, MSCIW, MSCI US, and KFTX are net contributors of volatility shocks whereas US dollar, oil, gold, VIX, green bond and green bond select are net receivers. Therefore, Fintech and common equities are not good hedging instruments in the same portfolio. Third, the short-term witnesses higher volatility transmission than the long-term. That is, holding assets for a long-term is likely to mitigate risks whereas trading financial assets in the short-term can increase risk because of higher volatility. Fourth, the traditional assets, gold and oil, as well as modern assets, green bonds, are useful as good hedgers compared with other assets because shock transmissions from them to Fintech, KFTX are below 0.1% and, more importantly, the total volatility spill-over of all assets in the sample is moderately average, accounting for 44.39%.","[Le, TN-Lan] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Le, TN-Lan] Univ Finance Mkt, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Abakah, Emmanuel Joel Aikins] Univ Adelaide, Business Sch, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Tiwari, Aviral Kumar] Rajagiri Business Sch, Rajagiri Valley Campus, Kochi, Kerala, India","University of Sydney; University of Adelaide; Rajagiri Business School (RBS)","Le, TL (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Le, TL (corresponding author), Univ Finance Mkt, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.","lan.le@sydney.edu.au; emmanuel.abakah@adelaide.edu.au","Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/C-5556-2011","Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/0000-0002-1822-9263; le, thingoclan/0000-0001-9691-7806; Abakah, Emmanuel Joel Aikins/0000-0003-1472-0722","","","","","81","73","73","38","104","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","0040-1625","1873-5509","","TECHNOL FORECAST SOC","Technol.

While sharding eliminates duplicate work between shards, it does not remove intra-shard duplication, i.e., every peer has to verify all transactions in its shard, thus becoming a newly exposed bottleneck. Aiming to improve the performance of individual shards, we propose Collaborative Transaction Verification (CTV), which allows peers to verify fewer transactions by sharing verification results. Equipped with dependency awareness, CTV guarantees that peers reach the same system state despite different transaction verification and execution orders. We implemented an OmniLedger-like sharding protocol based on Bitcoin Core and integrated CTV into the protocol. The evaluation results show that CTV can improve the performance of a shard by 2.6x.","[Ren, Liuyang; Ward, Paul A.

Today, a myriad of blockchain and cryptocurrency systems, applications, and technologies are widely available to companies, end-users, and even malicious actors who want to exploit the computational resources of regular users through cryptojacking malware. Especially with ready-to-use mining scripts easily provided by service providers (e.g., Coinhive) and untraceable cryptocurrencies (e.g., Monero), cryptojacking malware has become an indispensable tool for attackers. Indeed, the banking industry, major commercial websites, government and military servers (e.g., US Dept. of Defense), online video sharing platforms (e.g., Youtube), gaming platforms (e.g., Nintendo), critical infrastructure resources (e.g., routers), and even recently widely popular remote video conferencing/meeting programs (e.g., Zoom during the Covid-19 pandemic) have all been the victims of powerful cryptojacking malware campaigns. Nonetheless, existing detection methods such as browser extensions that protect users with blacklist methods or antivirus programs with different analysis methods can only provide a partial panacea to this emerging cryptojacking issue as the attackers can easily bypass them by using obfuscation techniques or changing their domains or scripts frequently. Therefore, many studies in the literature proposed cryptojacking malware detection methods using various dynamic/behavioral features. However, the literature lacks a systemic study with a deep understanding of the emerging cryptojacking malware and a comprehensive review of studies in the literature. To fill this gap in the literature, in this SoK paper, we present a systematic overview of cryptojacking malware based on the information obtained from the combination of academic research papers, two large cryptojacking datasets of samples, and 45 major attack instances. Finally, we also present lessons learned and new research directions to help the research community in this emerging area.","[Tekiner, Ege; Acar, Abbas; Uluagac, A.

Design/methodology/approach This study employs a Bayesian asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) (BADCC-MGARCH) model with skewness and heavy tails on daily sample ranging from August 11, 2015, to February 10, 2020, to investigate the dynamic correlation between price return of several cryptocurrencies and stock return of the technology companies' indices that mainly operate on the blockchain platform. Data are collected from multiple sources. For parameter estimation and model comparison, the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is employed. Besides, based on the expected Akaike information criterion (EAIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), deviance information criterion (DIC) and weighted Deviance Information Criterion (wDIC), the skewed-multivariate Generalized Error Distribution (mvGED) is selected as an optimal distribution for errors. Finally, some other tests are carried out to check the robustness of the results. Findings The study results indicate that blockchain-based technology companies' indices' return and price return of cryptocurrencies are positively correlated for most of the sampling period. Besides, the return price of newly invented and more advanced cryptocurrencies with unique characteristics, including Monero, Ripple, Dash, Stellar and Peercoin, positively correlates with the return of stock indices of blockchain-based technology companies for more than 93% of sampling days. The results are also robust to various sensitivity analyses. Research limitations/implications The positive correlation between the price return of cryptocurrencies and the return of stock indices of blockchain-based technology companies can be due to the investors' sentiments toward blockchain technology as both cryptocurrencies and these companies are based on blockchain technology. It could also be due to the applicability of cryptocurrencies for these companies, as the price return of more advanced and capable cryptocurrencies with unique features has a positive correlation with the return of stock indices of blockchain-based technology companies for more days compared to the other cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum, that may be regarded more as speculative assets. Practical implications The study results may show the positive role of cryptocurrencies in improving and developing technology companies that mainly operate on the blockchain platform and provide financial services and vice versa, suggesting that managers and regulators should pay more attention to the usefulness of cryptocurrencies and blockchains. This study also has important risk management and diversification implications for investors and companies investing in cryptocurrencies and these companies' stock.

To explore this unique setting, we marry models of stochastic bubbles and the standard model of product diffusion. A rational bubble is raised by speculative investors seeking short-term gains. We find that a bubble accelerates the adoption, which can help explain the fast diffusion of bitcoin. There are reinforcing interactions between the speculative investors and regular users of currency, which can make it easier to form a bubble (compared with a setting without regular users).

This study aims to identify the best cryptocurrency mining strategy based on service providers' performance for cryptocurrency mining using a hybrid analytics approach, which integrates the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy-TOPSIS techniques, along with sensitivity analysis. The results show that hosted mining is the overall best cryptocurrency mining strategy, followed by home mining and cloud mining, based on both total cost of operations and cryptocurrency payout criteria. The empirical findings also suggest that the critical features of the highest performing service providers (i.e., hosted mining strategies and cloud mining) were their flexibility of contracts and the superior efficiency in terms of the daily payout. Finally, of the three location alternatives for home mining, Turkey ranks first compared to the U.S. and Europe.","[Hacioglu, Umit; Chlyeh, Dounia; Yilmaz, Mustafa K.; Tatoglu, Ekrem] Ibn Haldun Univ, Sch Business, TR-34480 Istanbul, Turkey; [Tatoglu, Ekrem] Gulf Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Business Adm, Mubarak Al Abdullah Area, Block 5,Bldg 1, West Mishref, Kuwait; [Delen, Dursun] Oklahoma State Univ, Spears Sch Business, Tulsa, OK 74106 USA; [Delen, Dursun] Halic Univ, Fac Management, TR-34445 Istanbul, Turkey","Ibn Haldun University; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Tulsa; Halic University","Delen, D (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Spears Sch Business, Tulsa, OK 74106 USA.","umit.hacioglu@ihu.edu.tr; dounia.chlyeh@ibnhaldun.edu.tr; mustafa.yilmaz@ihu.edu.tr; tatoglu.e@gust.edu.kw; dursun.delen@okstate.edu","Delen, Dursun/AGA-9892-2022; Tatoglu, Ekrem/S-2369-2017","Tatoglu, Ekrem/0000-0002-9119-3252","","","","","58","4","4","9","15","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0167-9236","1873-5797","","DECIS SUPPORT SYST","Decis.

The main problem facing the PV power plants deployment is the intermittency which leads to instability of the grid. In order to stabilize the grid, either energy storage device - mainly batteries - or a power curtailment technique can be used. The additional cost on utilizing batteries make it not preferred solution, because it leads to a drop in the return on investment (ROI) of the project. A good alternative, is using a customized load (such as; cryptocurrency-based loads) which consumes the surplus energy. This paper investigating the usage of a customized load - cryptocurrency mining rig - to create an added value for the owner of the plant and increase the ROI of the project. These devices are widely used to perform the required calculations for validating the transactions on the network of the Blockchain. A comparison between the ROI of the mining rig and the battery have been conducted in this study. Based on this study the mining rig has superior ROI of 7.7% - in the case with the lowest ROI - compared to 4.5% for battery. Moreover, an improved controlling strategy is developed to combine both the battery and mining rig in the same system. The developed strategy is able to keep the profitability as high as possible during the fluctuation of the mining network.","[Eid, Bilal] Hasan Kalyoncu Univ, Elect & Elect Engn Dept, TR-27410 Gaziantep, Turkey; [Islam, Md Rabiul] Univ Wollongong, Fac Engn & Informat Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Shah, Rakibuzzaman] Fed Univ Australia, Dept Engn IT & Phys Sci, Ballarat, Vic 3353, Australia; [Abdullah-Al Nahid] Khulna Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Khulna 9208, Bangladesh; [Kouzani, Abbas Z.; Mahmud, M.

SIGTRAN first generates a graph based on the transaction records from blockchain. It then represents the nodes based on their structural and transactional characteristics. These node representations accurately differentiate nodes involved in illicit activities. SIGTRAN is generic and can be applied to records extracted from different networks. SIGTRAN achieves an F-1 score of 0.92 on Bitcoin and 0.94 on Ethereum, which outperforms the state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks obtained by much more complex, platform-dependent models.","[Poursafaei, Farimah; Zilic, Zeljko] McGill Univ, ECE, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Rabbany, Reihaneh] McGill Univ, CSC, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Poursafaei, Farimah; Rabbany, Reihaneh] Mila, Montreal, PQ, Canada","McGill University; McGill University","Poursafaei, F (corresponding author), McGill Univ, ECE, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Poursafaei, F (corresponding author), Mila, Montreal, PQ, Canada.","farimah.poursafaei@mila.quebec; rrabba@cs.mcgill.ca; zeljko.zilic@mcgill.ca","","","","","","","28","0","0","4","11","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-75762-5; 978-3-030-75761-8","LECT NOTES ARTIF INT","","","2021","12712","","","","","","27","39","","10.1007/978-3-030-75762-5_3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-75762-5_3","","","13","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS4GJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000719253600003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It was shown that with the rapid growth of crime involving cryptocurrencies, the legislation of various states is at the stage of formation of legal regulation of the fight against its illicit trafficking: only some countries have established the status of digital currency as property, provided for the specifics of seizure, storage and sale of digital currency in criminal cases. The need to recognize digital currencies as property has been substantiated. It is shown that the seizure and confiscation of cryptocurrencies should be carried out only by court decision. The lack of special knowledge in the field of digital technology among the investigator, prosecutor and the court requires the mandatory involvement of a specialist in the proceedings on cases of crimes committed with the use of digital currency.","[Voskobitova, Lydiya; Vilkova, Tatyana; Nasonov, Sergey; Khokhryakov, Maxim] Kutafin Moscow State Law Univ, Dept Criminal Procedure Law, Moscow, Russia; [Khokhryakov, Maxim] Kutafin Moscow State Law Univ, Inst Publ Law & Management, Moscow, Russia; [Reshetnikov, Yuri] Kutafin Moscow State Law Univ, Int Law Inst, Moscow, Russia","Kutafin Moscow State Law University; Kutafin Moscow State Law University; Kutafin Moscow State Law University","Voskobitova, L (corresponding author), Kutafin Moscow State Law Univ, Dept Criminal Procedure Law, Moscow, Russia.","","","","Transformation of Russian Law in the Conditions of Big Challenges: Theoretical and Applied Foundations [07500998-21-00];  [FSMW-20200030]","Transformation of Russian Law in the Conditions of Big Challenges: Theoretical and Applied Foundations; ","Publication prepared within the state task 07500998-21-00 dated 22.12.2020 Transformation of Russian Law in the Conditions of Big Challenges: Theoretical and Applied Foundations.

Centralized aspects such as concentrated ownership of governance tokens and admin keys have significant implications on their governance. Concerns include decisionmaking concentration risk and poor alignment of interests among stakeholders. From a regulatory viewpoint, centralized aspects could make it easier for regulators to impose requirements and therefore increase compliance costs. This might drive the DeFi community to seek further decentralization to avoid regulatory burdens. We conclude that the DeFi ecosystem should learn from the experience of both Internet governance as a partially decentralized system and from traditional corporate governance.","[Ushida, Ryosuke] Financial Serv Agcy Japan, Tokyo, Japan; [Ushida, Ryosuke; Angel, James] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA","Georgetown University","Angel, J (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.","ru64@georgetown.edu; angelj@georgetown.edu","","","","","","","16","0","0","7","13","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-662-63958-0; 978-3-662-63957-3","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2021","12676","","","","","","21","36","","10.1007/978-3-662-63958-0_2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-63958-0_2","","","16","Business, Finance; Computer Science, Information Systems; Communication; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Political Science","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics; Computer Science; Communication; Government & Law","BS3LU","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000713005000002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Because blockchain does not rely on a central authority, peers have to agree on the state of the ledger among themselves, i.e., they have to reach a consensus on the state of the transactions. The way nodes reach that consensus has gained incredible attention in the literature. Bitcoin uses the Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism, as did Ethereum at first. The latter decided to move from PoW to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) because of the high energy consumption required by PoW. To date, many other consensus protocols have been proposed to address the limitations of the seminal ones. In this paper, we inform researchers and practitioners about the current state of consensus protocols research. The aim is to provide an analysis of the research introducing new consensus protocols in order to enable a more unified treatment. To that end, we review 28 new consensus protocols and we propose a four category classification framework: Origin, Design, Performance and Security. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework by classifying the 28 protocols. Many surveys have already been proposed in the literature and some of them will be discussed later in the paper. Yet, we believe that this work is relevant and important for two reasons. Firstly, blockchain being a fast evolving topic, new consensus protocols emerge regularly and improvements are also put forward on a regular basis. Hence, this work aims at reflecting the latest state-ofthe-art in terms of consensus protocols. Secondly, we aim to propose a comprehensive classification framework, integrating knowledge from multiple works in the literature, as well as introducing classification dimensions that have not been proposed before. This work demonstrates that multiple consensus have been proposed in a short period of time, and highlights the differences between these protocols. Furthermore, it is suggested that researchers and practitioners who aim to propose consensus protocols in the future should pay attention to all the dimensions presented in the classification framework.","[Bouraga, Sarah] Univ Namur, Dept Business Adm, Namur, Belgium; [Bouraga, Sarah] Univ Namur, PReCISE Res Ctr, Namur, Belgium","University of Namur; University of Namur","Bouraga, S (corresponding author), Univ Namur, Dept Business Adm, Namur, Belgium.","sarah.bouraga@unamur.be","","","","","","","85","31","33","9","42","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0957-4174","1873-6793","","EXPERT SYST APPL","Expert Syst.

However, in the existing E-commerce environments, the reputation scores of users (including sellers and buyers) are centrally computed and stored on a centralized cloud server, which might make errors or even engage in fraud and forgery. To address this issue, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized reputation system (BC-DRS) in the E-commerce environment, i.e., online shopping. In this system, the product information including product descriptions and comments is stored in the interplanetary file system (IPFS) and the corresponding address is returned, and the returned address and the reputation scores of users are stored on the blockchain. The reputation evaluation is implemented by designing and deploying a smart contract on the blockchain. Different from the traditional centralized reputation systems (CRSs), the proposed BC-DRS can protect the product information and users reputation scores from intentional and unintentional modifications, since it is very hard to change any data stored in the blockchain and IPFS. Also, as the reputation scores of users are computed and updated by all the ratings of their transactions weighted by the practical transaction factors, it is effective to resist the common attacks, i.e., unfair rating and collusion. In addition, this system also contains a monetary incentive mechanism for the evaluation, which is helpful to form a virtuous circle in online shopping. The proposed BC-DRS is simulated on the popular blockchain platform, i.e., Ethereum with Solidity language. The experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed BC-DRS has desirable usability and reliability. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, we have observed that, perhaps surprisingly, even though crypto-currencies rely on a distributed accounting ledger technology, relatively few of those studies were conducted by accounting academics. While some of the features of a system like Bitcoin do not necessarily rely on a traditional accounting knowledge, this knowledge is key in designing effective real-world distributed systems. Building on a foundational framework developed by Risius and Spohrer (2017), we provide support for their hypothesis that to date, research in this area has been predominantly of a somewhat narrow focus (i.e., based upon exploiting existing programming solutions without adequately considering the fundamental needs of users). This is particularly reflected by the abundance of Bitcoin-like crypto-currency code-bases with little or no place for business applications. We suggest that this may severely limit an appreciation of the relevance and applicability of decentralized systems, and how they may support value creation and improved governance. We provide supporting arguments for this statement by considering four applied classes of problems where a blockchain/distributed ledger can add value without requiring a crypto-currency to be an integral part of the functioning system. We note that each class of problem has been viewed previously as part of accounting issues within the legacy centralized ledger systems paradigm. We show how accounting knowledge is still relevant in the shift from centralized to decentralized ledger systems. We advance the debate on the development of (crypto-currency free) value-creating distributed ledger systems by showing that applying accounting knowledge in this area has potentially a much wider impact than that currently being applied in areas limited to auditing and operations management. We develop a typology for general distributed ledger design which assists potential users to understand the wide range of choices when developing such systems. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Design/methodology/approach This study identifies and analyzes overreactions and mispricing in markets for cryptocurrencies by applying a broad set of thresholds that depend on market-specific dynamics and volatilities. This study also analyzes the returns on days following abnormal returns and identifies significant differences from normal returns using the t-test and the Mann-Whitney U-test. The researchers further complement the literature by using end-of-the-day returns in addition to high-low returns. Additionally, this study considers a broad sample of 50 cryptocurrencies for an expanded time span (2015-2020) that includes the big currencies as well as smaller currencies. Findings Findings detect the existence of overreactions and, thus, market inefficiencies in crypto markets. The findings for different methodological approaches are similar, which underpins the robustness of the findings. By considering a broad sample that includes small and big currencies, we can show the existence of a market size effect. By considering a broad set of thresholds, the authors further found evidence for a magnitude effect, which means that higher initial abnormal returns are related to higher inefficiencies. Practical implications This paper has practical implications. Market inefficiencies were detected, which can be used in practical trading to obtain excess returns. In fact, methodological approach of this study and its results can be used to derive a strategy for trading in cryptocurrencies that can be easily implemented. Based on the study's findings, the authors can expect positive access returns by applying this trading strategy. Originality/value The authors complement the literature on market inefficiencies and mispricing in crypto markets by analyzing price patterns after initial abnormal returns. Researchers contribute by applying different methodological approaches in addition to the approaches used so far, by considering a set of different thresholds and by applying a much broader data set that enables the study to analyze additional aspects.","[Kellner, Tobias] Univ Erfurt, Chair Int Econ & Econometr, Erfurt, Germany; [Maltritz, Dominik] Univ Erfurt, Int Econ & Econometr, Erfurt, Germany","University of Erfurt; University of Erfurt","Maltritz, D (corresponding author), Univ Erfurt, Int Econ & Econometr, Erfurt, Germany.","dominik.maltritz@uni-erfurt.de","","Kellner, Tobias/0000-0001-9946-2333","","","","","29","1","1","1","2","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","0144-3585","","","J ECON STUD","","OCT 18","2022","49","8","","","","","1585","1608","","10.1108/JES-09-2021-0488","http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JES-09-2021-0488","","DEC 2021","24","Economics","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Business & Economics","5K3KR","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000736237000001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

With sharding, the processing of a transaction might not be completed locally within a node and potentially requires involvement of multiple shards. Such cross-shards transactions have a negative impact on system performance and are frequent with traditional state partition solutions which are often based on a simple mapping of data into shards. By locating together parts of the system state accessed by frequent transactions, the amount of cross-shard transactions can be reduced. On the other hand, the representation of such particular mappings can be memory intensive. In this article, we study traffic-aware sharding that can be described in memory-efficient mappings. We first survey existing mapping schemes in common blockchains. We indicate the tradeoff between the size of the mapping of data to shards and the required transaction processing time and suggest algorithms for finding memory-light sharding of low cross-shard rate. We generalize the approach towards an efficient incremental computation of shards and probabilistic representation of the mapping to shards. We examine the efficiency of the solutions and the required frequency of sharding computation based on real information of the Ethereum network.","[Mizrahi, Avi; Rottenstreich, Ori] Technion, Dept Comp Sci, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel; [Rottenstreich, Ori] Technion, Dept Elect Engn, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel","Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Technion Israel Institute of Technology","Rottenstreich, O (corresponding author), Technion, Dept Comp Sci, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel.","avraham.m@cs.technion.ac.il; or@technion.ac.il","","Mizrahi, Avi/0000-0002-5715-724X","Technion Hiroshi Fujiwara Cyber Security Research Center; Israel National Cyber Directorate; Gordon Fund for System Engineering; Alon fellowship; German-Israeli Science Foundation (GIF) Young Scientists Program; Taub Family Foundation; Polak Fund for Applied Research, at the Technion","Technion Hiroshi Fujiwara Cyber Security Research Center; Israel National Cyber Directorate; Gordon Fund for System Engineering; Alon fellowship; German-Israeli Science Foundation (GIF) Young Scientists Program; Taub Family Foundation; Polak Fund for Applied Research, at the Technion","This work was partially supported by the Technion Hiroshi Fujiwara Cyber Security Research Center and the Israel National Cyber Directorate, by the Gordon Fund for System Engineering, by the Alon fellowship, by German-Israeli Science Foundation (GIF) Young Scientists Program, by the Taub Family Foundation as well as by thte Polak Fund for Applied Research, at the Technion.","","39","3","3","8","19","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","1932-4537","","","IEEE T NETW SERV MAN","IEEE Trans.

Despite striking volatility, their high average returns and low correlations have established CCs as alternative investment assets for portfolio and risk management. We investigate the benefits of adding CCs to well-diversified portfolios of conventional financial assets for different types of investors, including risk-averse, return-maximizing and diversification-seeking investors who may trade at different frequencies, namely, daily, weekly or monthly. We calculate out-of-sample performance and diversification benefits for the most popular portfolio-construction rules, including mean-variance optimization, risk-parity, and maximum-diversification strategies, as well as combined strategies. Our results demonstrate that CCs can improve the risk-return profile of portfolios, but their benefit depends on investor objectives. In particular, diversification strategies (maximizing the portfolio diversification index or equating risk contributions) draw appreciably on CCs and show, in line with spanning tests, CCs to be non-redundant extensions of the investment universe. However, when we introduce liquidity constraints via the LIBRO method to account for illiquidity of many CCs, out-of-sample performance drops considerably, while the diversification benefits persist. We conclude that the utility of CC investments strongly depends on investor characteristics.","[Petukhina, Alla] Humboldt Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dorotheen Str 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Trimborn, Simon] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Management Sci, Kowloon, 7-268 Lau Ming Wai Acad Bldg, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Hardle, Wolfgang Karl] Humboldt Univ, IRTG 1792, Dorotheen Str 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Hardle, Wolfgang Karl] Xiamen Univ Xiamen, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, N114,Econ Bldg, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Hardle, Wolfgang Karl] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Business, 50 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178899, Singapore; [Hardle, Wolfgang Karl] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Ke Karlovu 3, Prague 12116, Czech Republic; [Hardle, Wolfgang Karl] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Informat Management & Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Elendner, Hermann] Weizenbaum Inst, Hardenbergstr 32, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Elendner, Hermann] UCL Comp Sci, UCL Ctr Blockchain Technol, Malet Pl, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Elendner, Hermann] ABC Res, Austrian Blockchain Ctr, Favoritenstr 111, A-1100 Vienna, Austria","Humboldt University of Berlin; City University of Hong Kong; Humboldt University of Berlin; Singapore Management University; Charles University Prague; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; University of London; University College London","Trimborn, S (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Management Sci, Kowloon, 7-268 Lau Ming Wai Acad Bldg, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","trimborn.econometrics@gmail.com","","Trimborn, Simon/0000-0003-3745-4164","Czech Science Foundation (Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky) [19/28231X]; NUS FRC grant [R-146-000-298-114]; CityU Start-up Grant [7200680]; European Union's Horizon 2020 'FIN-TECH' Project [825215]; IRTG 1792 'High Dimensional Non Stationary Time Series,' Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin","Czech Science Foundation (Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky); NUS FRC grant; CityU Start-up Grant; European Union's Horizon 2020 'FIN-TECH' Project; IRTG 1792 'High Dimensional Non Stationary Time Series,' Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin","Financial support from IRTG 1792 'High Dimensional Non Stationary Time Series,' Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, Czech Science Foundation (Grantova Agentura C. eske Republiky) under grant no. 19/28231X and NUS FRC grant R-146-000-298-114 'Augmented machine learning and network analysis with applications to cryptocurrencies and blockchains' as well as CityU Start-up Grant 7200680 `Textual Analysis in Digital Markets' is gratefully acknowledged.

A privacy protection mechanism based on the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is proposed to judge the information query. On this basis, a Bloom filter privacy protection algorithm is proposed when the probability of information query and privacy, not being leaked, is less than the node privacy protection. It is based on variable factor disturbance, adjusting the number of bits' set to 1 in the Bloom filter to improve the privacy protection performance in different scenarios. The experiment uses Bitcoin transaction data from 2009 to 2019 as the test data to verify the effectiveness, reliability, and superiority of the method.","[Ge, Lin] Zhengzhou Univ Aeronaut, Sch Intelligent Engn, Zhengzhou 450046, Henan, Peoples R China; [Ge, Lin] Civil Aviat Univ China, Informat Technol Res Base, Tianjin 300300, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Tao] Natl Digital Switching Syst Engn & Technol Res Ct, Zhengzhou 45002, Henan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Tao] Natl Engn Lab Mobile Network Secur, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China","Zhengzhou University of Aeronautics; Civil Aviation University of China; PLA Information Engineering University","Ge, L (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ Aeronaut, Sch Intelligent Engn, Zhengzhou 450046, Henan, Peoples R China.;Ge, L (corresponding author), Civil Aviat Univ China, Informat Technol Res Base, Tianjin 300300, Peoples R China.","lingesnow@126.com","","tao, jiang/0000-0002-3793-4603; Ge, Lin/0000-0002-0802-3384","Science and Technology Planning Project of Henan Province [192102210283]; Key Scientific Research Projects of Colleges and Universities in Henan Province [20A520040]; Open Project Foundation of Information Technology Research Base of Civil Aviation Administration of China [CAAC-ITRB-201707]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1904119]","Science and Technology Planning Project of Henan Province; Key Scientific Research Projects of Colleges and Universities in Henan Province; Open Project Foundation of Information Technology Research Base of Civil Aviation Administration of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This research was supported by the Science and Technology Planning Project of Henan Province (project no. 192102210283), Key Scientific Research Projects of Colleges and Universities in Henan Province (project no. 20A520040), Open Project Foundation of Information Technology Research Base of Civil Aviation Administration of China (project no.

The VCoVaR relaxes normality assumptions and is estimated via copula. While important theoretical findings of the measure are detailed, the empirical study analyses how different distressing events of the cryptocurrencies impact the risk level of each other. The results show that Litecoin displays the largest impact on Bitcoin and that each cryptocurrency is significantly affected if an event of joint distress among the remaining market participants occurs.

These features can also be used by government and military organizations for communications purposes.

But there will be a new twist for this impending wave of bankruptcies: how should bankruptcy courts deal with crypto assets like Bitcoin? This Essay argues that the rise of cryptocurrency investments over the last decade poses serious complications for the next round of consumer and business bankruptcies.

Design/methodology/approach The empirical analysis relies on the cross-quantilogram approach that allows one to assess the temporal (lag-lead) association between two stationary time series at different parts of their joint distribution. The data are daily prices and trading volumes from four markets (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin). Findings Extreme returns either positive or negative tend to lead high volume levels.

Further, it shows that consumer innovativeness moderates the effectiveness of crypto-compensation. After establishing the effectiveness of crypto-compensation, Study 2 finds a moderating effect of consumer choice in influencing crypto-compensation effectiveness. Study 3 reveals the differential effect of communicating different crypto-compensation benefits on customer recovery satisfaction.

Our results also suggest that the driving factor behind initial returns is the movement of the cryptocurrency markets, measured by both Bitcoin and Ethereum returns. In addition, whether or not the jurisdiction has cryptocurrency regulations is an influential indicator.

For example, non-cash safe havens, such as gold and Bitcoin, can be wildly volatile and unpredictable, even during market crises. Cash as a safe haven also carries risk in that it can lose value in the event of currency devaluation or inflation. The volatility of non-cash safe havens and the potential for currencies to lose value in severe market crises presents investors with the difficult task of identifying the ultimate safe-haven asset(s) for their portfolios. In selecting the safe-haven assets that best meet a program's needs and long-term objectives, it is important to understand the risk exposures that financial safe havens carry and to consider diversifying safe-haven exposure so as not to rely on a single asset to provide protection in a market downturn.","[Nigro, Mike] Two Sigma New York, New York, NY 10013 USA","","Nigro, M (corresponding author), Two Sigma New York, New York, NY 10013 USA.","Mike.nigro@twosigma.com","","","","","","","8","0","0","2","21","PAGEANT MEDIA LTD","LONDON","ONE LONDON WALL, LONDON, ENGLAND","1520-3255","2168-8435","","J ALTERN INVEST","J.

Without any a priori knowledge of the type of breaks to expect, eye-balling the data can indicate changes in some parameter, e.g., the mean. This, however, can distort the result of a structural break test for that parameter, because the data themselves suggested the hypothesis. In this paper, we formalize the eye-balling procedure and theoretically derive the implied size distortion of the structural break test. We also show that eye-balling a stretch of historical data for possible changes in a parameter does not invalidate the subsequent procedure that monitors for structural change in new incoming observations. An empirical application to Bitcoin returns shows that taking into account the data-dredging bias, which is incurred by looking at the data, can lead to different test decisions.","[Hoga, Yannick] Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Univ Str 12, D-45117 Essen, Germany","University of Duisburg Essen","Hoga, Y (corresponding author), Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Univ Str 12, D-45117 Essen, Germany.","yannick.hoga@vwl.uni-due.de","","","Projekt DEAL","Projekt DEAL","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.","","30","0","0","1","6","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0932-5026","1613-9798","","STAT PAP","Stat.

The recent introduction of error correcting codes in sharded blockchain by Li et al. partially settles this trilemma, boosting throughput without compromising security and decentralization. In this paper, we improve the coded sharding scheme in three ways. First, we propose a novel 2-Dimensional Sharding strategy, which inherently supports cross-shard transactions, alleviating the need for complicated inter-shard communication protocols. Second, we employ distributed storage techniques in the propagation of blocks, improving latency under restricted bandwidth.

The study examines the attributes influencing purchaser trust in timber products, revealing that the country of origin is the strongest predictor of purchaser trust, followed by the price level for the timber product, the presence of a certification scheme, and the duration of the relationship with the supplier.

This technology is often celebrated for its potential for decentralization, distribution, privacy, and a lack of intermediaries and coordinators for transactions and general governance. Because of these features, blockchain technology, and, in particular, its most famous inauguration-the bitcoin blockchain-is frequently identified with libertarianism. In this essay, we argue that the ideological context of blockchain technology is much more complicated. In addition to unraveling a number of background ideologies and their role in this technology, we raise the ontological issue concerning the relationship of ideology to technology. These matters have implications for, among other things, the approach that should be taken to blockchain's governance, as well as how international lawyers may approach this foreign-seeming phenomenon that has its proponents from the European Central Bank to the United Nations (not, however, forgetting the private sector nor the digital underground).","[Korhonen, Outi] Turku Univ, Int Law, Turku, Finland; [Rantala, Juho] Tampere Univ, Tampere, Finland; [Rantala, Juho] Turku Univ, Turku, Finland","University of Turku; Tampere University; University of Turku","Korhonen, O (corresponding author), Turku Univ, Int Law, Turku, Finland.","","","Rantala, Juho/0000-0002-6507-6749; korhonen, outi/0000-0002-6591-2022","","","","","20","1","1","2","6","CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND","","2398-7723","","AJIL UNBOUND","AJIL Unbound","DEC 6","2021","115","","","","","","408","412","PII S2398772321000659","10.1017/aju.2021.65","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/aju.2021.65","","","5","International Relations; Law","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","International Relations; Government & Law","XJ3OM","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000726701800001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Little is known, however, about the underlying reasons for this vulnerability. Here we develop an agent-based model to study how features of cryptocurrency networks contribute to their vulnerability to double-spending attacks. Perhaps surprisingly, we find neither the number of network nodes nor its path length seem to influence the probability of successful attacks. We find robust evidence that the network's clustering coefficient has substantial influence. In particular, scale-free networks, with their small clustering coefficients, are more than twice as likely to succumb to double-spending attacks than are networks with larger coefficients, such as regular networks. The implication is that cryptocurrency networks, which are scale-free, may be uniquely susceptible to double-spending attacks.","[Zhang, Junhuan; Xu, Yuqian] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junhuan] Beihang Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Complex Syst Anal Management & Decis, Beihang, Peoples R China; [Houser, Daniel] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Houser, Daniel] George Mason Univ, Interdisciplinary Ctr Econ Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","Beihang University; Beihang University; George Mason University; George Mason University","Zhang, JH (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhang, JH (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Complex Syst Anal Management & Decis, Beihang, Peoples R China.","junhuan.zhang@gmail.com","Zhang, Junhuan/HGC-9327-2022","Zhang, Junhuan/0000-0003-3969-0240","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71801008]; Beihang University [KG12113201, ZF202S1876]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beihang University","Junhuan Zhang acknowledges support from National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71801008], and Beihang University [grant numbers KG12113201, ZF202S1876].","","33","1","1","3","15","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1351-847X","1466-4364","","EUR J FINANC","Eur.

We provide a systematization methodology over several axes of characteristics and performance, while highlighting insights and research gaps that we have identified, such as lack of dispute-resolution solutions between the regulator and the entity under audit, and the incompatibility of ledger pruning or off-chain protocols with regulatory requirements.

The paper argues that such a solution could significantly reduce the biases and misconduct that now exist in the academic peer review process. Theory suggests such a system could operate effectively as a distributed encrypted telecommunications network where nodes are anonymous, do not trust each other, with minimal central authority. To incentivize the academic community to join such a community, the paper proposes a new pseudo-cryptocurrency called litcoin (literature coin). This litcoin-based system would create economic scarcity based on proof of knowledge (POK), which is a synthesis of the proof of work (POW) mechanism used in bitcoin, and the proof of stake (POS) mechanism used in various altcoin communities.","[Wright, Keith] Univ Houston Downtown, Houston, TX 77002 USA","University of Houston System; University of Houston; University of Houston Downtown","Wright, K (corresponding author), Univ Houston Downtown, Houston, TX 77002 USA.","","","","","","","","43","0","0","3","12","IGI GLOBAL","HERSHEY","701 E CHOCOLATE AVE, STE 200, HERSHEY, PA 17033-1240 USA","1947-3451","1947-346X","","INT J TECHNOETHICS","Int.

Enthralled by the hype, many enterprises chose to pursue blockchain-based initiatives for their business processes. However after a period of over-excitement, now blockchain is viewed with concern because a large number of the earlier blockchain-based projects, especially those not related to finance, have not been productive.

"J","Shovkhalov, S; Idrisov, H","","","","Shovkhalov, Shamil; Idrisov, Hussein","","","Economic and Legal Analysis of Cryptocurrency: Scientific Views from Russia and the Muslim World","LAWS","","","English","Article","","","","","","cryptocurrency; bitcoin; money; currency; mining; law; code; responsibility; Islam; Sharia; Islamic economics","","The article is devoted to the analysis of cryptocurrency as a new phenomenon in the modern global economic processes and legal institutions. The relevance of the study is predetermined by the very specifics of such a phenomenon as cryptocurrency consisting of a distributed ledger technology, which determines the peculiarities of issuing, storing and performing operations with cryptocurrency. Moreover, the cryptocurrency turnover directly correlates with the national legislation of individual countries, which are the subject of domestic regulation with currency, tax legislation and legislation on the securities market. Sometimes, in this regard, there is a clash of public interests and the interests of entities involved in the circulation of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency, as an unconventional, trendy phenomenon of the recent times, has become the object of research and discussions on all the world platforms, starting with academia, continuing with the business community and ending with state institutions. There are many reasons for explaining such interest and they can all be reduced to two main blocks: the advantages and the disadvantages of cryptocurrency circulation. The problem of cryptocurrency turnover, on the one hand, is that until now none of the national economies have regulated the cost-effective mechanism for the cryptocurrency turnover and, on the other hand, the leading countries have not yet set up an effective system of legal regulation of cryptocurrency. Many countries are in the active process of working to adequately address the above problem. Separately, it is worth highlighting the interest of Muslim countries in this issue, where discussions are still underway about the permissibility of cryptocurrency in Islamic law. As for the Russian realities in the context of the issue under study, the Federal Law On Digital Financial Assets, Digital Currency and on Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation, which came into effect on 1 January 2021, was supposed to streamline relations of subjects including cryptocurrencies, but, according to the experts in this field, this law is far from impeccable and this sphere of relations cannot be quickly and effectively regulated. This article describes the characteristics of cryptocurrency, its essence, disadvantages and advantages as an object of economic and civil law relations. The purpose of the research is to analyze the economic and legal phenomenon of cryptocurrency, as well as its characteristics in the Muslim legal system. The complexity of the work should be emphasized as a novelty. Based on the designated goal and the logic of construction, the study consists of three interrelated parts. The first part outlines the characteristics of cryptocurrency as an economic category, the second part is devoted to its legal analysis and the last part of the study demonstrates the Islamic perception (Sharia analysis) of this phenomenon. As a conclusion on the scientific research, we will highlight the following provisions. First, economically, nowadays, cryptocurrency is a rather controversial financial instrument: on the one hand, it has great investment attractiveness, but on the other hand, it is subject to great volatility and seems to be a rather risky financial asset. Secondly, from a legal standpoint, cryptocurrencies have not yet found their consistent consolidation and further legal regulation in the Russian legislation. It seems that the legal regulation of this institution will systematically develop depending on what application and results of its turnover the cryptocurrency will have in the future. Finally, the Islamic interpretation of the cryptocurrency phenomenon boils down to the absence of a single, consistent explanation of it from the perspective of Islam and Sharia as an object of permissibility (or prohibition) of transactions with it. It is necessary to further analyze the practice of using cryptocurrency and its impact on the economy and legal institutions in order to make a final decision on its permissibility or prohibition in correlation with the types of activity and the upcoming consequences associated with it.","[Shovkhalov, Shamil; Idrisov, Hussein] Chechen State Pedag Univ, Dept Legal Disciplines, Grozny 364024, Russia; [Shovkhalov, Shamil] Siberian Fed Univ, Dept Accounting Anal & Auditing, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Idrisov, Hussein] Chechen State Univ, Dept Civil Law & Procedure, Grozny 364024, Russia","Siberian Federal University; Kadyrov Chechen State University","Idrisov, H (corresponding author), Chechen State Pedag Univ, Dept Legal Disciplines, Grozny 364024, Russia.;Idrisov, H (corresponding author), Chechen State Univ, Dept Civil Law & Procedure, Grozny 364024, Russia.","shovkhalov.shamil@gmail.com; huseyn23@rambler.ru","Shovkhalov, Shamil/ABG-4406-2020; Idrisov, Hussein/AAV-9553-2020","Shovkhalov, Shamil/0000-0001-8430-3276; Idrisov, Hussein/0000-0002-7008-8904","Chechen State Pedagogical University","Chechen State Pedagogical University","This research was carried out within the framework of the implementation of the grant of the Chechen State Pedagogical University for young scientists and students for 2021.","","39","3","3","3","24","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2075-471X","","LAWS-BASEL","Laws","JUN","2021","10","2","","","","","","","32","10.3390/laws10020032","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/laws10020032","","","17","Law","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Government & Law","TB8JB","","gold, Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000668191300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The methodology used in our evaluation considers the Hyperledger Fabric to set up a network for sharing medical data, which is obtained from a real database. The performance of this network was collected through experimental studies, with the Hyperledger Caliper benchmark, by measuring the throughput and latency of the network with and without the CouchDB database.

In this demo, we channels the otherwise wasted computational power to the practical purpose of training neural network models, through the proposed proof of learning (PoLe) consensus algorithm. In PoLe, the training/testing data are released to the entire blockchain network (BCN) and the consensus nodes train NN models on the data, which serves as the proof of learning. When the consensus on the BCN considers a NN model to be valid, a new block is appended to the blockchain.

It may result in losses caused by human error or poor design of the user interface. We created a cryptocurrency wallet with a full on-chain solution for aliasing accounts and tokens to improve user experience and avoid unnecessary errors. The aliasing system consists of a number of smart contracts deployed on top of the blockchain network that give the ability to register aliases to accounts and tokens and use them instead of opaque addresses.

This work formalizes the PoA requirements in account-based blockchains, focusing on the unique hierarchical account structure of the Diem blockchain, formerly known as Libra. In particular, we take into account some unique features of the Diem infrastructure to consider different PoA modes by exploring time-stamping edge cases, cold wallets, locked assets, spending-ability delegation and account pruning, among the others. We also propose practical optimizations to the byte-size of PoA in the presence of light clients who cannot run a full node, including skipping Validator updates, while still maintaining the 66.67% Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) guarantee.","[Chatzigiannis, Panagiotis] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Chalkias, Konstantinos] Novi Financial Facebook Res, Menlo Pk, CA USA","George Mason University","Chatzigiannis, P (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.","pchatzig@gmu.edu","","","","","","","36","0","0","2","4","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-81645-2; 978-3-030-81644-5","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2021","12809","","","","","","27","41","","10.1007/978-3-030-81645-2_3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-81645-2_3","","","15","Computer Science, Information Systems","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS1IB","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000691381600003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Our framework enables the analysis of different weight functions while proving all statements at the appropriate level of abstraction. This allows us to quickly derive protocol guarantees for different weight functions. We exemplify the usefulness of our framework by capturing the classical Bitcoin protocol as well as exponentially growing functions as special cases. We show the typical properties chain growth, chain quality and common prefix for both, and further show that the latter provide an additional guarantee, namely a weak form of optimistic responsiveness. More precisely, we prove for a certain class of exponentially growing weight functions that in periods without corruption, the confirmation time only depends on the unknown actual network delay instead of the known upper bound.","[Kamp, Simon Holmgaard; Magri, Bernardo; Nielsen, Jesper Buus; Thomsen, Soren Eller] Aarhus Univ, Concordium Blockchain Res Ctr, Aarhus, Denmark; [Matt, Christian; Tschudi, Daniel] Concordium, Zurich, Switzerland","Aarhus University","Kamp, SH (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Concordium Blockchain Res Ctr, Aarhus, Denmark.","kamp@cs.au.dk; magri@cs.au.dk; cm@concordium.com; jbn@cs.au.dk; sethomsen@cs.au.dk; dt@concordium.com","","Tschudi, Daniel/0000-0001-6188-1049; Thomsen, Soren Eller/0000-0002-6931-4740; Nielsen, Jesper Buus/0000-0002-7074-0683","","","","","16","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-88238-9; 978-3-030-88237-2","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2021","12912","","","","","","299","319","","10.1007/978-3-030-88238-9_15","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-88238-9_15","","","21","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BU0AE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000866319200015","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Blockchain has applications in many domains, such as healthcare, the Internet of Things (IoT), and data management. Data management is defined as obtaining, processing, safeguarding, and storing information about an organization to aid with making better business decisions for the firm. The collected information is often shared across organizations without the consent of the individuals who provided the information. As a result, the information must be protected from unauthorized access or exploitation. Therefore, organizations must ensure that their systems are transparent to build user confidence. This paper introduces the architectural design and development of a blockchain-based system for private data management, discusses the proof-of-concept prototype using Hyperledger Fabric, and presents evaluation results of the proposed system using Hyperledger Caliper.

The paper examines datacenter management and sustainability practices in the Nordic region. It explores what community impacts occur, and how communities manage conflicting objectives. It investigates the technical and policy options that can make datacenters more sustainable and/or lower-carbon and it explores associated stakeholder and public views in the three countries. In exploring these themes, our study examines the shifting energy governance of datacenters, including patterns of electricity consumption and cooling but also circular economy operations and power densities. We also analyze a series of 40 solutions for eco-friendly design or green datacenter management across the entire lifecycle. We conclude with implications for energy and climate policy as well as future research.","[Sovacool, Benjamin K.; Monyei, Chukwuka G.; Upham, Paul] Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit SPRU, Business Sch, Falmer, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Energy Technol, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Aarhus, Denmark","University of Sussex; Aarhus University","Sovacool, BK (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit SPRU, Jubilee Bldg,Room 367, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.","b.sovacool@sussex.ac.uk","; monyei, chukwuka/I-6553-2016","Upham, Paul/0000-0003-1998-4698; Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403; monyei, chukwuka/0000-0001-6958-708X","European Union [869327]","European Union(European Commission)","This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement no. 869327, Toward Just, Ethical and Sustainable Arctic Economies, Environments and Societies (JUSTNORTH).

However, the PACF is only suitable for detecting linear correlations. This article proposes the conditional distance autocovariance function (CDACF), which is zero if and only if measured time series components are conditionally independent. Due to the lack of this property, traditional tools for measuring partial correlations such as the PACF cannot work well for nonlinear sequences. Based on the CDACF, we introduce a tool known as an integrated conditional distance autocovariance function (ICDACF), which can test conditional temporal dependence structures of a sequence and estimate the order of an autoregressive process. Simulation studies reveal that the ICDACF can detect the conditional dependence of nonlinear autoregressive models efficiently while controlling for type-I error rates. Finally, an analysis of a Bitcoin price dataset using the ICDACF demonstrates that our method has considerable advantages over other state-of-the-art methods.","[Zhang, Qiang; Pan, Wenliang; Li, Chengwei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Math, Southern China Ctr Stat Sci, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xueqin] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, Int Inst Finance, Dept Stat & Finance, Hefei, Peoples R China","Sun Yat Sen University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Wang, XQ (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, Int Inst Finance, Dept Stat & Finance, Hefei, Peoples R China.","wangxq88@mail.sysu.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Key Research and Development Program of Guangdong, China; Pearl River S&T Nova Program of Guangzhou","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research and Development Program of Guangdong, China; Pearl River S&T Nova Program of Guangzhou","The authors thank the editor, the associate editor, and the two anonymous referees for their insightful comments that greatly improved this article.

A number of specious, if not outright fraudulent issuers took advantage of this craze by publicly listing their stock while touting some connection to blockchain technology. One of these issuers, Longfin Corp., exploded to a $6 billion market cap despite being little more than an empty shell promoted by alleged fraudsters. Short sellers who investigated Longfin were seemingly correct about the company being worthless, but a lengthy trading halt instituted by Nasdaq caused many of these short sellers to suffer considerable losses instead of cashing out on what would otherwise be hugely profitable short positions. This Note proposes changes to the regulatory scheme that currently allows self-regulating exchanges like Nasdaq to issue such trading halts with almost no restrictions. The recommended changes would further the principles of free and open markets and transparency that are fundamental to the securities laws by preventing exchanges from arbitrarily halting trade for extended periods of time.","[Davis, Thomas] Univ Calif San Francisco, Hastings Coll Law, San Francisco, CA 94102 USA","University of California System; University of California San Francisco","Davis, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Hastings Coll Law, San Francisco, CA 94102 USA.","","","","","","","","89","0","0","0","1","UNIV CALIF","SAN FRANCISCO","HASTINGS COLLEGE LAW 200 MCALLISTER ST, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94102 USA","0017-8322","","","HASTINGS LAW J","Hastings Law J.","FEB 4","2021","72","2","","","","","687","718","","","","","","32","Law","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Government & Law","QR1WE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000625006000006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This study shows that standard methodologies often used in finance research are inevitably samplespecific due to the very nature of financial markets. While the consensus of earlier research postulates a rejection of the time-honored Levy hypothesis, the results of this study strongly indicate that the variance of variance does not exist in any of the financial key markets that are considered. An unexpected finding of this study is that the variance process governing the U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate market is generating more extreme events than the Bitcoin market.

Powerful quantum computers enable attackers to break into blockchains by rapid inverse calculations of mathematical problems that are the core of one of the main blockchain security foundations, known as asymmetric cryptography. They are also able to violate the integrity of public blockchains like bitcoin through mining acceleration. Hence, quantum computers can engender threats to the supply chain users of blockchain. On the other hand, there are ongoing efforts to create a quantum-resistant solution. One approach for such a solution is to utilize quantum tools themselves. Moreover, sufficiently powerful quantum computers are still being developed, and it is still unclear whether a quantum solution will arrive first or vice versa. The contrasting duality of quantum computers and lack of a clear picture over the timing of the arrival of a solution and threats give rise to the uncertainty that might hinder the attractiveness of blockchains for supply chains.","[Rad, Fakhreddin F.] Sodertorn Univ, Sch Social Sci, Subject Business Studies, Huddinge, Sweden","Sodertorn University","Rad, FF (corresponding author), Sodertorn Univ, Sch Social Sci, Subject Business Studies, Huddinge, Sweden.","","","","","","","","84","0","0","1","3","IGI GLOBAL","HERSHEY","701 E CHOCOLATE AVE, STE 200, HERSHEY, PA 17033-1240 USA","1548-1115","1548-1123","","INT J ENTERP INF SYS","Int.

We point to one potentially important resource: ordinal patterns, which are extensively used in physics but not in the study of cognitive processes. We explain the potential importance of ordinal patterns for short-term prediction, and how natural constraints imposed through (i) ordinal pattern types, (ii) their transition probabilities and (iii) their irreversibility signature may support short-term prediction.

It has been possible to export this innovation to the most diverse fields, including the culture and entertainment industry and media. However, and after six years of developing different models to incorporate blockchain into journalism, an integrated model to act as a reference in this field is still lacking. After analyzing and grouping the wide potential of blockchain in journalism into so-called regimes, this work points out both promising and failed projects in each of the three regimes proposed, viz. registration, economic, and organizational. It is concluded that, despite the very interesting developments regarding the registration regime and intellectual property protection, on the one hand, and economic regime and tokenization, on the other, the inherent decentralized configuration of blockchain currently represents a large obstacle to the construction of an integrated model for its use in journalism.","[Callejo-Gallego, Javier] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia UNED, Fac Ciencias Polit & Sociol, Dept Sociol Teoria Metodol & Cambio Social 1, Obispo Trejo 2, Madrid 28040, Spain","Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED)","Callejo-Gallego, J (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Educ Distancia UNED, Fac Ciencias Polit & Sociol, Dept Sociol Teoria Metodol & Cambio Social 1, Obispo Trejo 2, Madrid 28040, Spain.","mcallejo@poli.uned.es","Callejo, Javier/N-4485-2014","Callejo, Javier/0000-0002-0856-5642","","","","","38","0","0","3","10"," EDICIONES PROFESIONALES INFORMACION SL-EPI","BARCELONA","MISTRAL, 36, BARCELONA, ALBOLOTE, SPAIN","1386-6710","1699-2407","","PROF INFORM","Prof. Inf.","MAY-JUN","2021","30","3","","","","","","","e300322","10.3145/epi.2021.may.22","http://dx.doi.org/10.3145/epi.2021.may.22","","","14","Communication; Information Science & Library Science","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Communication; Information Science & Library Science","TC1OV","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000668413600017","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Unfortunately, benefiting from its anonymity and immutability, scammers deploy various traps in smart contracts to exploit other participants and seize illegal proceeds. To identify smart Ponzi contracts-a classic fraud widely popular on Ethereum, previous studies present several machine learning-based models with considerable accuracy. However, the performance of their models relies on the behavioral features of smart contracts to a large margin, which are extracted from the transaction records only after a contract has been running for some time. In this paper, we borrow ideas from text feature extraction from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to build a classification model based on an improved CatBoost algorithm. A novel feature extraction pattern is applied in our model to deeply mine the logic of smart contract code. This approach can be used to detect Ponzi schemes at deployment time with improved performance, and thus can avoid the loss of investors originally.","[Zhang, Yanmei; Kang, Siqian; Zhu, Jianming] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Informat Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Dai, Wei] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Finance Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shiping] CSIRO Data61, Software & Computat Syst, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Central University of Finance & Economics; Central University of Finance & Economics; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)","Zhang, YM (corresponding author), Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Informat Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China.","Zhangym@cufe.edu.cn; ksiqian@163.com; daiwei00@gmail.com; shiping.chen@data61.csiro.au; zjm@cufe.edu.cn","","","Emerging Interdisciplinary Project of CUFE; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61602536, 61773415, 61672104, 61772134]","Emerging Interdisciplinary Project of CUFE; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the Emerging Interdisciplinary Project of CUFE and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.61602536, 61773415, 61672104, 61772134).","","21","1","1","2","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-1683-2","","","","2021","","","","","","","301","308","","10.1109/SCC53864.2021.00043","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SCC53864.2021.00043","","","8","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT1QN","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000800199400032","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Such behavior can heavily inflate the false positive rate (FPR) of the CUSUM-based procedure to spuriously signal the presence of an explosive episode. Our modified procedure involves replacing the standard variance estimate in the CUSUM statistics with a nonparametric kernel-based spot variance estimate. We show that the sequence of modified CUSUM statistics has a joint limiting null distribution which is invariant to any time-varying volatility present in the innovations and that this delivers a real-time monitoring procedure whose theoretical FPR is controlled. Simulations show that the modification is effective in controlling the empirical FPR of the procedure, yet sacrifices only a small amount of power to detect explosive episodes, relative to the standard procedure, when the shocks are homoskedastic.

In IoT-blockchain, the number of IoT devices and the blockchain network scale are supposed to establish an appropriate balance. Therefore, building a precise traffic model between the blockchain and IoT devices is crucial for designing and optimizing an IoT-Blockchain network. This paper proposes an innovative traffic model of the IoT-blockchain system, which describes traffic of blockchain nodes under the different sizes of IoT input and network scale. We implement a lightweight Bitcoin-like blockchain based on PoW and connect with several IoT simulators to conduct various network traffic experiments. Our mathematical model and experimental results demonstrate the relationship between self-similarity, network traffic, blockchain scales, and the number of IoT inputs.","[Zhang, Haihua; Lao, Laphou; Shu, Chang; Xiao, Bin] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Hong Kong Polytechnic University","Zhang, HH (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","haihua.zhang@connect.polyu.hk; laphou.lao@connect.polyu.hk; majery.shu@connect.polyu.hk; csbxiao@comp.polyu.edu.hk","","","HK RGC GRF PolyU [15216220, 152124/19E]","HK RGC GRF PolyU","This work was supported in part by the HK RGC GRF PolyU 15216220 and 152124/19E.","","7","0","0","2","9","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1550-3607","","978-1-7281-7122-7","IEEE ICC","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500333","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500333","","","6","Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Telecommunications","BS4HX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000719386000089","View Full Record in Web of Science"

While they have proven their potential as a store of value, exchanging assets across several blockchains remains a challenge. Our paper proposes a new protocol, R-SWAP, for cross-chain swaps that outperforms existing solutions. Our protocol is built on top of two abstractions: relays and adapters that we formalize for the first time in this paper. Furthermore, we prove the correctness of R-SWAP and analytically evaluate its performances, in terms of cost and latency. Moreover, we evaluate the performances of R-SWAP in two case studies showing the generality of our approach: atomic swaps between Ethereum and Bitcoin (two popular permissionless blockchains) and atomic swaps between Ethereum and Tendermint (one permissionless and one permissioned blockchain).","[Lys, Leonard; Potop-Butucaru, Maria] Sorbonne Univ, Paris, France; [Lys, Leonard; Potop-Butucaru, Maria] LIP6, Paris, France; [Lys, Leonard; Micoulet, Arthur] PALO IT, Paris, France","UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite","Lys, L (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, Paris, France.;Lys, L (corresponding author), LIP6, Paris, France.;Lys, L (corresponding author), PALO IT, Paris, France.","llys@palo-it.com","","Lys, Leonard/0000-0002-7080-9409","","","","","30","2","2","4","4","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-93043-1; 978-3-030-93042-4","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2021","13084","","","","","","18","37","","10.1007/978-3-030-93043-1_2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-93043-1_2","","","20","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS8AE","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000769651600002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Then a principal component analysis is performed over the collected temporal graph samples, which exhibits eigengraphs, graphs whose temporal weight variations model the sampled graph series. Analysis of the temporal timeline of each of the main eigengraphs reveals moments of importance in terms of structural graph changes. Parameters such as the dimension of the embeddings and the number of temporal samples are explored. Two case studies are presented: a Bitcoin subgraph, where findings are cross-checked by looking at the subgraph behavior itself, and the Enron email network, which allows us to compare our findings with prior studies.

The question arises from the fact that such assets, and cryptocurrencies in particular, do not fit into traditional categories of property as understood by the common law, being neither choses in possession nor choses in action. However, following a series of decisions in the last couple of years, it now seems reasonably settled that this question will be answered in the affirmative, although no cases have so far reached the highest level of the courts. The consequences have yet to be worked out. One obvious consequence is that cryptocurrencies can be the subject of a trust. However, the unique features of digital assets give rise to a number of interesting problems, both theoretical and practical, on which there is little authoritative guidance.","[Cooper, Gilead Q.

They can be represented as copulas and permit the formulation and estimation of models that combine arbitrary marginal distributions with copula processes for the dynamics of the volatility proxy. The idea is illustrated using a Gaussian ARMA copula process and the resulting model is shown to replicate many of the stylized facts of financial return series and to facilitate the calculation of marginal and conditional characteristics of the model including quantile measures of risk. Estimation is carried out by adapting the exact maximum likelihood approach to the estimation of ARMA processes, and the model is shown to be competitive with standard GARCH in an empirical application to Bitcoin return data.","[J.

To do so, we explore the cultural significance of phenomena such as myth, faith, and ritual, without excluding both the realms of technological practices and techno-scientific narrative. Drawing on a comparison with the legend of King Arthur, we analyse how the legendary creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, translates contemporary anxieties resulting from the financial crisis and the centralisation of power. By analysing white papers, we further explore the persuasive narratives which convey how ethics and virtue can be encoded into software, and, finally, we describe the secular rituals that reinforce cohesion among the community - in moments which are often guided by charismatic preachers and specialists. We argue that blockchain technologies have had a symbolic impact in re-invigorating enchantment and material romanticism towards finance and technology, which has had a wider impact on the social perception and acceptance of the transition to a digital society.","[Faustino, Sandra; Faria, Ines; Marques, Rafael] Univ Lisbon, ISEG Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, CSG Res Social Sci & Management, Dept Social Sci, Rua Miguel Lupi 20,Edificio Bento Jesus Caraca, P-1249078 Lisbon, Portugal","Universidade de Lisboa","Faustino, S (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, ISEG Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, CSG Res Social Sci & Management, Dept Social Sci, Rua Miguel Lupi 20,Edificio Bento Jesus Caraca, P-1249078 Lisbon, Portugal.","sandrafcoelho@gmail.com","D.

This paper, thus, addresses such problems when it comes to determining the applicable law from a business-to-business perspective leaving aside the particular problems raised by the conflict-of-law rules oriented to protect the weaker party to a contract. The analysis, however, starts with a general approach to the two concepts which are the object of this paper: smart contracts and blockchain technology.","[Garriga Suau, Georgina] Univ Barcelona, Derecho Int Privado, Barcelona, Spain","University of Barcelona","Suau, GG (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Derecho Int Privado, Barcelona, Spain.","ggarriga@ub.edu","","","","","","","65","1","1","3","8","ASOC ESPANOLA PROFESORES DERECHO INT & RELACIONES INT-AEPDIRI","MADRID","ESCUELA DIPLOMATICA, PASEO DE JUAN XXIII NO 5, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN","1697-5197","","","REV ELECTRON ESTUD I","Rev.

Claims in regard to Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies being dead are on the rise, whilst at the same time many claim the contrary. The vague statement encapsulates many different aspects and perspectives of a myriad of use cases, technology and platforms including both the technique as a whole and as individual instantiations. In this paper, we unpack the statement, break it down and investigate objectively concrete factors which provide indication in regard to whether Blockchain is dead. We examine metrics including budgets and investment; company registries and data; community engagement, projects and source code repositories; academic research and programmes; social media posts; and public interest. We individually demonstrate metrics that indicate the respective measures' healthy activity and come to the conclusion that the collective statement 'Blockchain is dead' does not hold. A clear message extracted from the work proposed herein is that success is achieved where the community comes together rather than works in isolation.","[Ellul, Joshua] Univ Malta, Ctr Distributed Ledger Technol, Msida, Malta","University of Malta","Ellul, J (corresponding author), Univ Malta, Ctr Distributed Ledger Technol, Msida, Malta.","joshua.ellul@um.edu.mt","","Ellul, Joshua/0000-0002-4796-5665","","","","","0","0","0","7","8","BRITISH BLOCKCHAIN ASSOC","LONDON","KEMP HOUSE 152-160 CITY RD, LONDON, EC1V 2NX, ENGLAND","","2516-3957","","J BRIT BLOCKCHAIN AS","J.

In our scheme, the miners periodically release a snapshot of the blockchain state (UTXO set), the other full nodes in the network, securely prune the historical blocks after attaining the required number of confirmations to the snapshot block. This is achieved through the modification of the block structure by including a representation for the state as an RSA accumulator called accumulator state in the block header and proofs of knowledge for deletion/inclusion of the current block's input/output transactions in the block. The secure and periodic pruning of the old blocks, reduce the synchronization time for a new node joining into the network. The simulation results demonstrate a significant reduction in the storage space of a full node and the bootstrapping cost of the new nodes.","[Reddy, B.

Contrary to conventional blockchains, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, many SSI systems do not capture on ledger the exchange of transactional data between individuals. By not capturing the exchange of transaction data such SSI systems have the advantage of complying with privacy regulations such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulations, but, at the same time, have the disadvantage of not capturing evidence that an exchange has happened. Such evidence, however, may be needed for audit and accountability purposes. To achieve these objectives and to preserve privacy, we leverage archival principles to introduce a novel concept of a proof registry, which we define as a set of technical components, data structures, and process flows, that assures that authoritative records offering evidence of transactions is captured, stored, and accessible. This solution solves the compliance and accountability problem while preserving the self-sovereignty and privacy of involved parties.","[Lemieux, Victoria; Voskobojnikov, Artemij; Kang, Meng] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada","University of British Columbia","Lemieux, V (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.","v.lemieux@ubc.ca; voskart@ece.ubc.ca; meng.kang@ubc.ca","","","","","","","19","1","1","1","3","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","0730-3157","","978-1-6654-2463-9","P INT COMP SOFTW APP","","","2021","","","","","","","1210","1216","","10.1109/COMPSAC51774.2021.00167","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/COMPSAC51774.2021.00167","","","7","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS2RI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000706529000156","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Design/methodology/approach The study applies the linear Toda and Yamamoto and nonlinear Diks and Panchenko Granger causality test to know the causal relationship of cryptocurrencies with COVID-19 pandemic. The study also uses the Narayan and Popp endogenous two structural break tests to capture the break period of the sample. Findings The findings of the study confirm the existence of unidirectional causal relation from COVID-19 confirmed and death cases to cryptocurrency price returns. While examining the break periods, the post-break period result indicates the presence of unidirectional linear causality from COVID-19 confirmed cases to Bitcoin and Ethereum price returns. This shows that prior knowledge of COVID-19 pandemic growth helps to predict the return of cryptocurrencies. Originality/value The study suggests the investors or crypto lovers to observe the growth of COVID-19 situations during their investment in cryptocurrency markets.","[Sahoo, Pradipta Kumar] Indian Inst Technol Hyderabad, Dept Liberal Arts, Hyderabad, India; [Sahoo, Pradipta Kumar] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Business & Law, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Hyderabad; Swinburne University of Technology","Sahoo, PK (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Hyderabad, Dept Liberal Arts, Hyderabad, India.;Sahoo, PK (corresponding author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Business & Law, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.","pradiptaiith@gmail.com","","Sahoo, Pradipta Kumar/0000-0001-9670-2004","","","","","66","17","17","0","11","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1086-7376","1755-6791","","STUD ECON FINANC","Stud.

MProve (EuroS&PW, 2019) was the first proof of reserves protocol for Monero which provided some privacy to the exchanges' addresses. As the key images and the addresses are inherently linked in the MProve proof, an observer could easily recognize the exchange-owned address when a transaction spending from it appears on the blockchain. This is detrimental for an exchange's privacy and becomes a natural reason for exchanges to not adopt MProve. To this end, we propose MProve+, a Bulletproofs-based (S&P, 2018) NIZK protocol, which unlinks the key images and the addresses, thus alleviating the drawback of MProve. Furthermore, MProve+ presents a promising alternative to MProve due to an order of magnitude smaller proof sizes along with practical proof generation and verification times.","[Dutta, Arijit; Vijayakumaran, Saravanan] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Bagad, Suyash] Aztec Protocol, London EC2A 4DQ, England","Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay","Dutta, A (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India.","arijit.dutta@iitb.ac.in; suyash@aztecprotocol.com; sarva@ee.iitb.ac.in","","Dutta, Arijit/0000-0003-3255-8327","Bharti Centre for Communication, IIT Bombay, India","Bharti Centre for Communication, IIT Bombay, India","Manuscript received December 16, 2020; revised March 28, 2021 and May 29, 2021; accepted May 31, 2021.

We first focus on static and dynamic correlations between the green bond and other assets, and then identify the causal association among them. The findings suggest that green bonds and other assets have conditional time-varying dependence, and dependence is relatively low. Using transfer entropy, further evidence is gained for causal associations between two variables, which is depicted by two categories like mono-direction and bi-direction. Such nexus reveals the transmitter and receiver of return innovations on these markets. These findings make a considerable contribution to policymakers and environmentally friendly investors with green bond positions.","[Ngo Thai Hung] Univ Finance Mkt, 778 Nguyen Kiem St, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","","Hung, NT (corresponding author), Univ Finance Mkt, 778 Nguyen Kiem St, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.","hung.nt@ufm.edu.vn","Hung, Ngo Thai/AAC-9394-2020","Hung, Ngo Thai/0000-0002-6976-1583","","","","","43","5","5","7","16","SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD","LONDON","1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","0972-1509","0973-0664","","GLOB BUS REV","Glob.

To reduce hardware and power costs, many criminals use the botnet to infect other hosts to mine cryptocurrency for themselves, which has led to the proliferation of mining botnets and is referred to as cryptojacking. At present, the mechanisms specific to cryptojacking detection include host-based, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) based, and dynamic network characteristics based. Host-based detection requires detection installation and running at each host, and the other two are heavyweight. Besides, DPI-based detection is a breach of privacy and loses efficacy if encountering encrypted traffic. This paper designs a lightweight cryptojacking traffic detection method based on network behavior features for an ISP, without referring to the payload of network traffic. We set up an environment to collect cryptojacking traffic and conduct a cryptojacking traffic study to obtain its discriminative network traffic features extracted from only the first four packets in a flow. Our experimental study suggests that the machine learning classifier, random forest, based on the extracted discriminative network traffic features can accurately and efficiently detect cryptojacking traffic.","[Hu, Xiaoyan; Shu, Zhuozhuo; Song, Xiaoyi; Cheng, Guang; Gong, Jian] Southeast Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China; [Hu, Xiaoyan] Southeast Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Comp Network & Informat Integrat, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Hu, Xiaoyan] Southeast Univ, Res Base Int Cyberspace Governance, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China; [Hu, Xiaoyan] Purple Mt Labs Network & Commun Secur, Nanjing 211111, Peoples R China","Southeast University - China; Southeast University - China; Southeast University - China","Hu, XY (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China.;Hu, XY (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Comp Network & Informat Integrat, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;Hu, XY (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Res Base Int Cyberspace Governance, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China.;Hu, XY (corresponding author), Purple Mt Labs Network & Commun Secur, Nanjing 211111, Peoples R China.","xyhu@njnet.edu.cn; 213171916@seu.edu.cn; xysong@njnet.edu.cn; gcheng@njnet.edu.cn; jgong@njnet.edu.cn","","","Foundation of Key Laboratory of National Defense Science and Technology Project [6142103200101]; Jiangsu Science and Technology Project [BY2020404]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61602114]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0801703, 2018YFB1800602]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (SEU) [2242021R41121]","Foundation of Key Laboratory of National Defense Science and Technology Project; Jiangsu Science and Technology Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (SEU)","This research was supported in part by the Foundation of Key Laboratory of National Defense Science and Technology Project un-der Grant 6142103200101, in part by Jiangsu Science and Technology Project under Grant BY2020404, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Project under Grant 61602114, in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFB0801703 and 2018YFB1800602, and in part by Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (SEU) under Grant 2242021R41121.","","18","0","0","2","4","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2334-0983","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8104-2","IEEE GLOB COMM CONF","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685085","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685085","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BT0PJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000790747200049","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Since its inception, it has gathered great attention because of its unique properties-immutability and decentralized authority. This technology is now being implemented in various fields such as healthcare, IoT, data management, etc., apart from cryptocurrencies. As it is a newly emerging technology, researchers and organizations face many challenges in integrating this technology into other fields. Consent management is one of the essential processes in an organization because of the ever-evolving privacy laws, which are introduced to provide more control to users over their data. This paper is a systematic review of Blockchain's application in the field of consent and privacy data management. The review discusses the adaptation of Blockchain in healthcare, IoT, identity management, and data storage.

Today, a large variety of blockchain technologies is expanding in order to fulfill technical and non-technical needs and requirements. Within this context, determining and most importantly evaluating the characteristics/performance of a given blockchain platform is crucial for system designers before deploying it. A number of blockchain simulators have been proposed in the literature over the past few years, as reviewed in this paper, but are often limited in several respects (lack of extensibility, do not allow for evaluating all aspects of a blockchain ...). This paper extends and improves a state-of-the-art simulator (BlockSim) into a new simulator called BlockPerf to overcome those limitations. Both simulators are compared based on a real-life (benchmarking) Bitcoin scenario, whose results show that BlockPerf provides more realistic results than BlockSim, improving by around approximate to 50% (in average) the outcomes.","[Polge, Julien; Ghatpande, Sankalp; Le Traon, Yves] Univ Luxembourg, Interdisciplinary Ctr Secur Reliabil & Trust, L-1359 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Kubler, Sylvain] Univ Lorraine, UMR 7039, CRAN, CNRS, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Robert, Jeremy] Cebi Luxembourg SA, L-7327 Steinsel, Luxembourg","University of Luxembourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Lorraine","Polge, J (corresponding author), Univ Luxembourg, Interdisciplinary Ctr Secur Reliabil & Trust, L-1359 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.","julien.polge@uni.lu","","Kubler, Sylvain/0000-0001-7672-7837; LE TRAON, Yves/0000-0002-1045-4861","Luxembourg National Research Fund through the Stability 4.0 [BRIDGES19/IS/13706587]","Luxembourg National Research Fund through the Stability 4.0","This work was supported by the Luxembourg National Research Fund through the Stability 4.0 under Grant BRIDGES19/IS/13706587.","","42","4","4","4","10","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2021","9","","","","","","107858","107872","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3101044","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3101044","","","15","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","TW0KA","","Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000682099400001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Blockchain technology allows implementing smart contracts through a distributed ledger, but has no reliable way of enforcing legal rules. For example, in networks such as Bitcoin, it is possible to engage in illegal activities such as money laundering and dealing in weapons. In addition, it is impossible to enforce and audit legal costs such as taxes and duties. This research has devised a plan that allows official institutions to enforce the rules and audits efficiently during automatic execution process of smart contracts. This article discusses five important challenges in applying legal rules to Blockchain: the accreditation to the contracting parties' and the goods' nature, collecting legal costs, enforcing territorial laws and auditing. We present Hyper Smart Contract, a method for regulating Blockchain-based smart contracts and assess the limitations of the current generation of smart contracts on Ethereum to ensure a proper implementation of this plan.

The mainstream countermeasures, namely PPS (pay-per-share) and PPLNS (pay-per-last-N-share), can hedge pool hopping but need to charge miners some fees when they join in a pool. Obviously, the higher fee charged, the higher cost of joining the pool, the less motivation of a miner to mine in the pool. In this article, we apply the zero-determinant (ZD) theory to design a novel pooled mining which offers an incentive mechanism for motivating miners not to switch in pools strategically by economic means without fee charged. In short, the proposed pooled mining has three unique features: 1) fee-free. No fee is charged if the miner does not hop, 2) wide applicability. It can be employed in both prepaid and postpaid mechanisms, and 3) fairness. Even can dominate the game with any miner, a pool has to cooperate when a miner does not hop among pools, implying that the pool cannot squeeze the honest miners financially. The fairness of our scheme makes it have long-term sustainability. Both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.","[Shi, Hongwei; Wang, Shengling] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Hu, Qin] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Cheng, Xiuzhen] George Washington Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Zhang, Junshan] Arizona State Univ, Sch Elect Comp & Energy Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Yu, Jiguo] Qilu Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Shandong Acad Sci, Jinan 250353, Peoples R China; [Yu, Jiguo] Shandong Comp Sci Ctr, Natl Supercomp Ctr Jinn, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China","Beijing Normal University; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; George Washington University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Qilu University of Technology; Qilu University of Technology","Wang, SL (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.","hongweishi@mail.bnu.edu.cn; wangshengling@bnu.edu.cn; qinhu@iu.edu; cheng@gwu.edu; junshan.zhang@asu.edu; jiguoyu@sina.com","Hu, Qin/AFL-7875-2022; Shi, Hongwei/GPW-8987-2022","Shi, Hongwei/0000-0001-6854-7385","National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFB2102600]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61772080, 61672321, 61771289, 61832012, 62072044]; Ministry of Education of China [2020KJ010301]; BNU Interdisciplinary Research Foundation for the First-Year Doctoral Candidates [BNUXKJC2022]; Faculty of Education, Beijing Normal University, and Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Technology and Educational Application, Ministry of Education","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); BNU Interdisciplinary Research Foundation for the First-Year Doctoral Candidates; Faculty of Education, Beijing Normal University, and Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Technology and Educational Application, Ministry of Education","YThis work was supported by National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2019YFB2102600), NationalNatural Science Foundation of China (No. 61772080, 61672321, 61771289, 61832012, and 62072044), the Blockchain Core Technology Strategic Research Program of Ministry of Education of China (No. 2020KJ010301), BNU Interdisciplinary Research Foundation for the First-Year Doctoral Candidates (No. BNUXKJC2022), the International Joint Research Project of Faculty of Education, Beijing Normal University, and Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Technology and Educational Application, Ministry of Education.","","23","4","4","6","13","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA","1545-5971","1941-0018","","IEEE T DEPEND SECURE","IEEE Trans.

With the advent of blockchain, several consensus protocols have been proposed to overcome the issues of the Bitcoin Proof-of-Work consensus protocol such as intensive power consumption and selfish strategies. In this paper, we propose a new leader election protocol that relies on external random number generator (RNG) services named Leader Election Protocol based on Trusted RNG Service Providers (LEP-TSP). External RNG services enable to reduce computation cost to elect a leader and strengthen the fairness requirement of uniform probability of being leader. First, we present a formal model of LEP-TSP based on the model proposed by Boneh et al. on the Single secret leader election. Then, we provide a construction of LEP-TSP and show that it achieves required security properties while more than 2/3 of participants are honest.","[Gouget, Aline; Toulemonde, Ambre] Thales DIS, Meudon, France; [Patarin, Jacques; Toulemonde, Ambre] Univ Versailles St Quentin En Yvelines, Versailles, France","UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay","Gouget, A (corresponding author), Thales DIS, Meudon, France.","aline.gouget@thalesgroup.com; jpatarin@club-internet.fr; ambre.toulemondel@thalesgroup.com","","","","","","","19","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-3924-4","","","","2021","","","","","","","73","80","","10.1109/BRAINS52497.2021.9569820","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BRAINS52497.2021.9569820","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7HN","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000848640500027","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this work we utilize the recently proposed blockchain adaptation of the rational protocol design (RPD) framework [EUROCRYPT '18] to analyze 51% double-spending attacks against Nakamoto-style proof-of-work based cryptocurrencies. We first observe a property of the originally proposed utility class that yields an unnatural conclusion against such attacks, and show how to devise a utility that avoids this pitfall and makes predictions that match the observable behavior-i.e., that renders attacking a dominant strategy in settings where an attack was indeed observed in reality. We then propose a generic remedy to the underlying protocol parameters that provably deter adversaries controlling a majority of the system's resources from attacks on blockchain consistency, including the 51% double-spending attack. This can be used as guidance to patch systems that have suffered such attacks, e.g., Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash, and serves as a demonstration of the power of game-theoretic analyses.","[Badertscher, Christian] IOHK, Zurich, Switzerland; [Lu, Yun] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Zikas, Vassals] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","University of Edinburgh; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus","Lu, Y (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.","christian.badertscher@iohk.io; Y.Lu-59@sms.ed.ac.uk; vzikas@cs.purdue.edu","","Lu, Yun/0000-0002-0098-0577; Badertscher, Christian/0000-0002-1353-1922","Sunday Group Inc.","Sunday Group Inc.","Yun Lu and Vassilis Zikas acknowledge support from Sunday Group Inc.","","33","2","2","0","1","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-84252-9; 978-3-030-84251-2","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2021","12827","","","","","","3","32","","10.1007/978-3-030-84252-9_1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-84252-9_1","","","30","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS1WA","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000696698900001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A (t, n) threshold signature scheme means in a set of n parties, at least t players can exercise the right of generating signatures on behalf of the group, and any less than t of the players' cooperation cannot generate a valid signature for the message nor obtain any information about the shared secret key. Thus, it is meaningful to construct a purely (t, n) threshold SM2 signature scheme (purely (t, n) means in the whole signature scheme, the threshold value is fixed to t). We propose a robust multiplication protocol of shared secrets to resolve the multiplication of shared secrets problem in existing threshold signature schemes.

Besides exchanging information, these peer entities also share heterogeneous and distributed edge resources. Blockchain is a promising technology to secure resource sharing in a peer-to-peer way. However, constrained by limited transaction throughput, existing blockchain systems (e.g., Bitcoin) cannot process numerous resource transactions concurrently produced in large-scale 6G networks. To cope with this issue, we propose a blockchain scaling scheme that combines Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with sharding. Our sharding method divides blockchain transactions into multiple mutually disjoint subsets maintained by different committees, which enables high-volume resource transactions to be processed and recorded concurrently. Additionally, all committees maintain a global DAG of blocks to resolve the security degradation raised by the sharding method. Moreover, we put forth a computation efficient consensus algorithm by leveraging miners' computing power to improve resource utilization efficiency. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme achieves good performance in resource utilization efficiency.","[Xie, Jin; Zhang, Ke] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Lu, YunLong] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, State Key Lab Rail Traff Control & Safety, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yan] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway","University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Beijing Jiaotong University; University of Oslo","Zhang, K (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China.","JinXie@ieee.org; zhangke@uestc.edu.cn; yunlong.lu@ieee.org; yanzhang@ieee.org","Zhang, Yan/AFK-8566-2022","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61941102, 62071092]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 61941102 and 62071092.","","13","0","0","12","18","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","0890-8044","1558-156X","","IEEE NETWORK","IEEE Netw.","JAN-FEB","2022","36","1","","","","","189","196","","10.1109/MNET.211.2100345","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MNET.211.2100345","","NOV 2021","8","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","1C1UJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000733486100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Given that stateof-the-art GNNs share many similarities with their CNN cousins and that CNNs suffer adversarial vulnerabilities, there has also been interest in exploring analogous vulnerabilities in GNNs. Indeed, recent work has demonstrated that node classification performance of several graph models, including the popular graph convolution network (GCN) model, can be severely degraded through adversarial perturbations to the graph structure and the node features. In this work, we take a first step towards detecting adversarial attacks against graph models. We first propose a straightforward single node threshold test for detecting nodes subject to targeted attacks. Subsequently, we describe a kernelbased two-sample test for detecting whether a given subset of nodes within a graph has been maliciously corrupted. The efficacy of our algorithms is established via thorough experiments using commonly used node classification benchmark datasets. We also illustrate the potential practical benefit of our detection method by demonstrating its application to a real-world Bitcoin transaction network.","[Zhang, Yingxue; Khan, Sakif] Montreal Res Ctr, Huawei Noahs Ark Lab, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Regol, Florence; Pal, Soumyasundar; Ma, Liheng; Coates, Mark] McGill Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada","McGill University","Zhang, YX (corresponding author), Montreal Res Ctr, Huawei Noahs Ark Lab, Montreal, PQ, Canada.","","","","","","","","42","0","0","1","3","MICROTOME PUBLISHING","BROOKLINE","31 GIBBS ST, BROOKLINE, MA 02446 USA","2640-3498","","","PR MACH LEARN RES","","","2021","130","","","","","","","","","","","","","11","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Mathematics, Applied; Statistics & Probability","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Mathematics","BR6DC","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000659893803059","View Full Record in Web of Science"

As a global ledger, the blockchain achieves the consistency of replica stored on each node through a consensus mechanism. A well-designed consensus mechanism, on one hand, needs to be efficient to meet the high frequency of online transactions. For example, the existing electronic payment systems can handle over 50,000 transactions per second (TPS), while Bitcoin can only handle an average of about 3TPS. On the other hand, it needs to have good security and high fault tolerance; that is, in the case when some nodes are captured by adversaries, the network can still operate normally. In this article, we establish a reputation system, called RTChain, to be integrated into the e-commerce blockchain to achieve a distributed consensus and transaction incentives. The proposed scheme has the following advantages. First, an incentive mechanism is used to influence the consensus behavior of nodes and the transaction behavior of users, which in turn influence the reputation scores of both nodes and users. That is, when a node correctly processes a transaction, it will receive the corresponding reputation value as a reward, and the reputation value will be reduced as punishment not only when the node is dishonest and violates the consensus agreement but also the transaction is not completed as required. Just like electronic transactions in the real world, the higher the reputation of the user, the more likely it is to be selected as the transaction partner. A user with a low reputation will be gradually eliminated in our system because it is difficult to complete the transaction. Second, RTChain uses a verifiable random function to generate the leader in each round, which guarantees fairness for all participants and, unlike PoW, does not consume a large amount of computing resources. Then our consensus mechanism selects the nodes with high reputation scores to reduce the number of nodes participating in the consensus, thus improving the consensus efficiency, so that RTChain's throughput can reach 4,000TPS. Third, we built a reputation chain to implement the distributed storage and management of reputation. Finally, our consensus mechanism is secure against existing attacks, such as flash attacks, selfish mining attacks, eclipse attacks, and double spending attacks, and allows nodes that participate in the consensus to fail, as long as the reputation of the failure node does not exceed one-third of the total reputation. We build a prototype of RTChain, and the experimental results show that RTChain is promising and deployable for e-commerce blockchains.","[Sun, You; Xue, Rui; Zhang, Rui; Su, Qianqian] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Sch Cyber Secur, Inst Informat Engn, State Key Lab Informat Secur SKLOIS, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Gao, Sheng] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Informat, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Central University of Finance & Economics","Zhang, R (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Sch Cyber Secur, Inst Informat Engn, State Key Lab Informat Secur SKLOIS, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.","sunyou@iie.ac.cn; xuerui@iie.ac.cn; zhangrui@iie.ac.cn; suqianqian@iie.ac.cn; sgao@cufe.edu.cn","","","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB1400700]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61772514, 62072487]; Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission [Z191100007119006]","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission(Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission)","The authors acknowledge the support from the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant No. 2017YFB1400700; the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61772514 and 62072487; and Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission (Project Number: Z191100007119006).","","39","11","12","14","53","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA","1533-5399","1557-6051","","ACM T INTERNET TECHN","ACM Trans.

However, there is a lack of evaluation indicators and quantitative evaluation models related to the data consistency mechanism, so it is difficult to systematically identify the scope of use and existing problems of the relevant mechanisms. Based on this, on the basis of summarizing the data consistency requirements of network application services, this paper presents a quantitative evaluation model of data consistency, and quantitatively evaluates the data consistency mechanism in the blockchain. the implementation effects and shortcomings of these mechanisms are explained. In addition, using the given evaluation model, we find that the network size of the decentralized network is the core factor affecting data consistency, and the network size is positively related to the strength of the network maintenance data consistency mechanism.","[Cao, Ruibo; Meng, Kun; Sun, Kai; Zheng, Ziqiang] Beijing Informat Sci & Technol Univ, Sch Comp, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cao, Ruibo; Meng, Kun; Sun, Kai; Zheng, Ziqiang] Beijing Informat Sci & Technol Univ, Sensing & Computat Intelligence Joint Lab, Beijing, Peoples R China","Beijing Information Science & Technology University; Beijing Information Science & Technology University","Cao, RB (corresponding author), Beijing Informat Sci & Technol Univ, Sch Comp, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Cao, RB (corresponding author), Beijing Informat Sci & Technol Univ, Sensing & Computat Intelligence Joint Lab, Beijing, Peoples R China.","caoruibo1007@163.com; mengkun1024@163.com; sunkai0211@163.com; zhengzq2333@163.com","","","Normal Project of Science and Technology at Beijing Information Science and Technology University [KM201911232002]","Normal Project of Science and Technology at Beijing Information Science and Technology University","This paper is supported by Normal Project of Science and Technology at Beijing Information Science and Technology University (No. KM201911232002)","","15","0","0","1","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-0-7381-1345-6","","","","2021","","","","","","","389","394","","10.1109/ICICN52636.2021.9673927","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICICN52636.2021.9673927","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BT1EK","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000796952700072","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, there are limitations in existing blockchain-related asset management and recovery methods. Therefore, we use zero-knowledge proof to design a cryptocurrency recovery scheme based on hidden assisting relationships (hereafter referred to as the CRSA scheme) to facilitate the recovery of blockchain assets. Specifically, when the user's private key is lost, and access to the assets cannot be obtained, the user leverages information such as the pre-defined list of assistants to authenticate himself/herself on the blockchain. Once the assistants have confirmed the legitimacy of the user's authentication request, the asset will be transferred from the old address to the new address. During the (identity) proof process, the zero-knowledge proof is used to ensure that the identification of assistants is not leaked to other nodes, assistants, and the adversary. We provide the formal definition of the above scheme and the security proof of the construction. We also implement a prototype of the system and evaluate its performance. Evaluations indicate that the time required for the zero-knowledge proof is less than 10s, and the block verification time is less than 100ms.","[Dai, Weiqi; Lv, Yan; Liu, Zhongze; Zou, Deqing] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Serv Comp Technol & Syst Lab, Natl Engn Res Ctr Big Data Technol & Syst, Hubei Engn Res Ctr Big Data Secur,Sch Cyber Sci &, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Informat Syst & Cyber Secur, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond] Univ South Australia, UniSA STEM, Adelaide, SA 5095, Australia; [Jin, Hai] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Serv Comp Technol & Syst Lab, Cluster & Grid Comp Lab, Natl Engn Res Ctr Big Data Technol & Syst,Sch Com, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China","Huazhong University of Science & Technology; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); University of South Australia; Huazhong University of Science & Technology","Zou, DQ (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Serv Comp Technol & Syst Lab, Natl Engn Res Ctr Big Data Technol & Syst, Hubei Engn Res Ctr Big Data Secur,Sch Cyber Sci &, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.","wqdai@hust.edu.cn; lyan18@hust.edu.cn; raymond.choo@fulbrightmail.org; blackskygg@gmail.com; deqingzou@hust.edu.cn; hjin@hust.edu.cn","Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond/A-3634-2009","Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond/0000-0001-9208-5336; Liu, Zhongze/0000-0002-3760-1710","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2020YFB1006000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62072202]; Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China [201902020016]; Cloud Technology Endowed Professorship","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China; Cloud Technology Endowed Professorship","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2020YFB1006000, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62072202, and in part by the Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China, under Grant 201902020016.

Yet, the path between the sender and the recipient along which payments are routed is selected such that it is short, cost efficient, and fast. The low degree of randomness in the path selection entails that anonymity sets are small. However, quantifying the anonymity provided by Lightning is challenging due to the existence of multiple implementations that differ with regard to the path selection algorithm and exist in parallel within the network. In this paper, we propose a general method allowing a local internal attacker to determine sender and recipient anonymity sets. Based on an in-depth code review of three Lightning implementations, we analyze how an adversary can predict the sender and the recipient of a multi-hop transaction. Our simulations indicate that only one adversarial node on a payment path uniquely identifies at least one of sender and recipient for around 70% of the transactions observed by the adversary. Moreover, multiple colluding attackers can almost always identify sender and receiver uniquely.","[Kumble, Satwik Prabhu; Epema, Dick; Roos, Stefanie] Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands","Delft University of Technology","Kumble, SP (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands.","","","","Ripple's University Blockchain Research Initiative","Ripple's University Blockchain Research Initiative","Thework was partially supported by Ripple's University Blockchain Research Initiative and the Distributed ASCI Supercomputer (DAS) was used for experiments.","","32","0","0","0","0","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","","978-1-4503-9051-4","","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","10.1145/3465481.3465761","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3465481.3465761","","","10","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BS6LQ","","Green Published, Bronze, Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000749539200020","View Full Record in Web of Science"

If among n users t < n/3 are malicious then it ensures consensus; otherwise (if t >= n/3), it eventually detects malicious users that cause disagreement. Polygraph is appealing for blockchain applications as it allows them to totally order blocks in a chain whenever possible, hence avoiding forks and double spending and, otherwise, to punish (e.g., via slashing) at least n/3 malicious users when a fork occurs. This problem is more difficult than perhaps it first appears. One could try identifying malicious senders by extending classic Byzantine consensus algorithms to piggyback signed messages. We show however that to achieve accountability the resulting algorithms would then need to exchange Omega(kappa(2) . n(5)) bits, where kappa is the security parameter of the signature scheme. By contrast, Polygraph has communication complexity O(kappa.n(4)). Finally, we implement Polygraph in a blockchain and compare it to the Red Belly Blockchain to show that it commits more than 10,000 Bitcoin-like transactions per second when deployed on 80 geodistributed machines.","[Civit, Pierre; Gramoli, Vincent] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Gilbert, Seth] NUS, Singapore, Singapore","University of Sydney; National University of Singapore","Civit, P (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.","pierrecivit@gmail.com; seth.gilbert@comp.nus.edu.sg; vincent.gramoli@sydney.edu.au","","","Australian Research Council [DP180104030, FT180100496]","Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","We wish to thank Alejandro Ranchal Pedrosa for his help in reproducing the experimental results.

Due to the design, the positioning of nodes in the network topology is a highly influential factor regarding the experienced performance, costs, and fee revenue of network participants. As a consequence, today's Lightning Network is built around a small number of highly-connected hubs. Recent literature shows the centralizing tendencies to be incentive-compatible and at the same time detrimental to security and privacy. The choice of attachment strategies therefore becomes a crucial factor for the future of such systems. In this paper, we provide an empirical study on the (local and global) impact of various attachment strategies for payment channel networks. To this end, we introduce candidate strategies from the field of graph theory and analyze them with respect to their computational complexity as well as their repercussions for end users and service providers.

In this paper, we first define decentralisation as it is implemented for technical architectures and then discuss the technical, social, political and economic ideas that drive the development of decentralised, and in particular, distributed systems. We argue that technical efforts towards decentralisation tend to go hand-in-hand with ambitions for rearranging power dynamics. We caution, however, against simplistic understandings of power in relation to the decentralisation-centralisation spectrum, and argue that in practice, decentralisation might very well be served by and produce centralising effects. The paper then goes on to discuss the critical literature that highlights some of the common assumptions and critiques made about decentralisation and the pros and cons of a decentralised approach. Finally, we propose some of the missing parts to current debates about decentralisation, and argue for a more nuanced and grounded approach to the centralisation/decentralisation dichotomy.","[Bodo, Balazs] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Brekke, Jaya Klara] Univ Durham, Durham, England; [Hoepman, Jaap-Henk] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen, Netherlands","University of Amsterdam; Durham University; Radboud University Nijmegen","Bodo, B (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.","bodo@uva.nl; j.k.brekke@durham.ac.uk; jhh@cs.ru.nl","Bodo, Balazs/AHD-9878-2022","Bodo, Balazs/0000-0001-5623-5448","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [759681]","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC))","Bodo received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 759681.","","80","4","4","3","8","ALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT INST INTERNET & SOC","BERLIN","OBERWALLSTRASSE 9, BERLIN, 10117, GERMANY","2197-6775","","","INTERNET POLICY REV","Internet Policy Rev.","","2021","10","2","","","SI","","","","","10.14763/2021.2.1563","http://dx.doi.org/10.14763/2021.2.1563","","","21","Communication; Law","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Communication; Government & Law","TU2BN","","gold, Green Submitted, Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000680844700012","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Similar to PoW's mining pools, PoS's stake pools, i.e., collaborative entities comprising of multiple stakeholders, allow a party to earn rewards more regularly, compared to participating on an individual basis. However, stake pools tend to increase centralization, since they are typically managed by a single party that acts on behalf of the pool's members. In this work we propose Conclave, a formal design of a Collective Stake Pool, i.e., a decentralized pool with no single point of authority. We formalize Conclave as an ideal functionality and implement it as a distributed protocol, based on standard cryptographic primitives. Among Conclave's building blocks is a weighted threshold signature scheme (WTSS); to that end, we define a WTSS ideal functionality and propose two constructions based on threshold ECDSA, which enable (1) fast trustless setup and (2) identifiable aborts.","[Karakostas, Dimitris; Kiayias, Aggelos] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Larangeira, Mario] Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan; [Karakostas, Dimitris; Kiayias, Aggelos; Larangeira, Mario] IOHK, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","University of Edinburgh; Tokyo Institute of Technology","Karakostas, D (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.;Karakostas, D (corresponding author), IOHK, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","dimitris.karakostas@ed.ac.uk; akiayias@inf.ed.ac.uk; mario@c.titech.ac.jp","","","JSPS KAKENHI [JP21K11882]","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work is supported by JSPS KAKENHI No. JP21K11882.","","36","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-88418-5; 978-3-030-88417-8","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2021","12972","","","","","","370","389","","10.1007/978-3-030-88418-5_18","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-88418-5_18","","","20","Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS8JQ","","Green Submitted, Green Accepted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000772653800018","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Still, cryptocurrencies have not yet become Decentralized Payment Systems (DPS) because of the high volatility of bitcoin and many of the altcoins. We investigated a proposed method to form a non-collateralized stablecoin called the Morini's Scheme of Inv&Sav wallets. We figured out two equations for the rebasement for the Inv wallet balances and then compared the results. We found the second rebasement method to be fairer to the agents, but we found the issue of negative balances with both methods. We proposed novel solutions to overcome these issues. One of the proposed solutions was to freeze some money in the Say wallet if there is a negative balance in the Inv wallet. Another proposed solution was to introduce a two-money economy of money and antimoney to turn the current centralized token distribution model decentralized and make transactions more probable even if agents do not have enough money funds; this could be seen as a decentralized version of credit cards.","[Heinonen, Henri T.] Univ Jyvaskyla, IT Dept, Jyvaskyla, Finland","University of Jyvaskyla","Heinonen, HT (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, IT Dept, Jyvaskyla, Finland.","henri.t.heinonen@student.jyu.fi","","Heinonen, Henri/0000-0001-5961-3571"," [200092]","","We thank Professor Pekka Neittaanmaki, Professor Timo Hamalainen and Professor of Practice Veikko Hara for discussions and feedback.

Smart contracts are small programs that describe a set of rules for supervising associated funds, often written in a Turing-complete programming language called Solidity. Furthermore, Ethereum is currently one of the most extensive cryptocurrencies next to Bitcoin. This provides an extraordinary opportunity for attackers to exploit potential zero-day vulnerabilities in this ecosystem that are tightly twisted with financial gain. Consequently, this paper introduces a practical framework called EthFuzz to identify vulnerabilities and generate concrete exploits for the Ethereum ecosystem. Our system works through a graph-based method in combination with dynamic symbolic execution. Moreover, our proposed framework can tackle the path explosion problem in its symbolic execution engine. To prove our approach's usefulness, we could successfully identify and generate 26,015 exploits out of 207,412 exploitable paths, within 1,000,000 real-world smart contracts on the Ethereum live blockchain network.","[Ashouri, Mohammadreza] St Polten Univ Appl Sci, Dept Cyber Secur, St Polten, Austria","","Ashouri, M (corresponding author), St Polten Univ Appl Sci, Dept Cyber Secur, St Polten, Austria.","mohammadreza.ashouri@fhstp.ac.at","","","","","","","28","0","0","3","4","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","1867-8211","1867-822X","978-3-030-90019-9; 978-3-030-90018-2","L N INST COMP SCI SO","","","2021","398","","","","","","144","163","","10.1007/978-3-030-90019-9_8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-90019-9_8","","","20","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BS7ZY","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000769458100008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Expansion of blockchain technology, however, to other areas, such as healthcare, arts, culture, and entertainment, is being considered internationally. Especially important challenges for ensuring the reliability of blockchain networks and the security of peer-to-peer networks are shortening the block propagation times throughout a blockchain network to reduce fork and preventing malicious eclipse attacks against targeted nodes in a network Previous methods have tried to increase the block propagation speed at the expense of imposing a higher burden on each node and a higher risk of eclipse attack This paper proposes a new neighbor selection method based on the neighbor's regional information. That is, each node has a relatively small number neighbors located outside its region. By using this simple method, the distribution of blocks throughout the network becomes faster and the random neighbor selection nature in a blockchain network is kept intact; thus, risk of eclipse attack is low.","[Matsuura, Hiroshi; Goto, Yoshinori; Sao, Hidehiro] NTT Network Serv Syst Labs, Tokyo, Japan","Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corporation","Matsuura, H (corresponding author), NTT Network Serv Syst Labs, Tokyo, Japan.","hiroshi.matsuura.gt@hco.ntt.co.jp; yoshinori.gotou.zr@hco.ntt.co.jp; hidehiro.sao.cg@hco.ntt.co.jp","","","","","","","28","2","2","2","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-1760-0","","","","2021","","","","","","","21","28","","10.1109/BLOCKCHAIN53845.2021.00015","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BLOCKCHAIN53845.2021.00015","","","8","","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","","BS9CN","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000779214600003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Unlike other schemes like RSA, Schnorr signatures and more, it is particularly hard to construct efficient threshold signature protocols for ECDSA (and DSA). As a result, the best-known protocols today for secure distributed ECDSA require running heavy zero-knowledge proofs and computing many large-modulus exponentiations for every signing operation. In this paper, we consider the specific case of two parties (and thus no honest majority) and construct a protocol that is approximately two orders of magnitude faster than the previous best. Concretely, our protocol achieves good performance, with a single signing operation for curve P-256 taking approximately 37 ms between two standard machine types in Azure (utilizing a single core only). Our protocol is proven secure for sequential composition under standard assumptions using a game-based definition. In addition, we prove security by simulation under a plausible yet non-standard assumption regarding Paillier. We show that partial concurrency (where if one execution aborts, then all need to abort) can also be achieved.","[Lindell, Yehuda] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ramat Gan, Israel","Bar Ilan University","Lindell, Y (corresponding author), Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ramat Gan, Israel.","lindell@biu.ac.il","","","","","","","31","0","0","3","8","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0933-2790","1432-1378","","J CRYPTOL","J.

Ethereum, the second-generation blockchain introduced smart contracts, and many DApps have emerged due to them. Those DApps showed the feasibility of blockchain in various industries. However, even though the growth of blockchain technology, still many DApps are based on Ethereum, and supper its performance issue. Since the performance evaluation in Ethereum mainnet is almost impossible, and there are no formalized performance evaluation frameworks, it is hard to perform appropriate performance evaluation of Ethereum. Detail performance evaluations on Ethereum networks are essential for developing and operating DApps. In this paper, we use Hyperledger Caliper, an automated performance evaluation framework to evaluate an Ethereum private network, and the Ropsten testnet to overcome above problems. We evaluate the performance with a specific smart contract and analyze the results. Our evaluation results show that the Ethereum private network performs better than the Ropsten testnet, and the Ropsten testnet is unstable for performance evaluation. In addition, our results show that the performance of the transactions can differ following their content.","[Choi, Wonseok; Hong, James Won-Ki] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Pohang, South Korea","Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH)","Choi, W (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Pohang, South Korea.","ws4583@postech.ac.kr; jwkhong@postech.ac.kr","","","Institute of Information Communications Technology Planning Evaluation (IITP) - Korean government (MSIT) [2018-000749]; ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program [IITP2021-2017-0-01633]","Institute of Information Communications Technology Planning Evaluation (IITP) - Korean government (MSIT)(Institute for Information & Communication Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP), Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program","This work was supported by the Institute of Information Communications Technology Planning Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (2018-000749, Development of Virtual Network Management Technology based on Artificial Intelligence) and the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program (IITP2021-2017-0-01633).","","17","3","3","1","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2576-8565","2576-8557","978-4-88552-332-8","ASIA-PAC NETW OPER M","","","2021","","","","","","","325","329","","","","","","5","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BT6JC","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000841861700066","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Sketches are popular hash-based data structures used to represent a large amount of data while supporting particular queries such as on set membership, cardinality estimation and identification of large elements. Often, to achieve time and memory savings, sketches allow potential inaccuracies in answers to the queries. The design of popular blockchain networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum makes use of sketches for various tasks such as summarization of transaction blocks or declaring the interests of light nodes. Similarly, they seem natural to deal with the size of the state in blockchains. In this paper, we study existing and potential future applications of sketches in blockchains. We first summarize current blockchain use cases of sketches. Likewise, we explore how this coupling can be generalized to a wider range of sketches and additional functionalities. In particular, we explain how sketches can detect anomalies based on efficient an summary of the state or traffic.","[Rottenstreich, Ori] Technion, Haifa, Israel","","Rottenstreich, O (corresponding author), Technion, Haifa, Israel.","","","","Technion Hiroshi Fujiwara Cyber Security Research Center; Israel National Cyber Directorate; Gordon Fund for System Engineering; Alon fellowship; German-Israeli Science Foundation (GIF) Young Scientists Program; Taub Family Foundation; Polak Fund for Applied Research at the Technion","Technion Hiroshi Fujiwara Cyber Security Research Center; Israel National Cyber Directorate; Gordon Fund for System Engineering; Alon fellowship; German-Israeli Science Foundation (GIF) Young Scientists Program; Taub Family Foundation; Polak Fund for Applied Research at the Technion","This work was partially supported by the Technion Hiroshi Fujiwara Cyber Security Research Center and the Israel National Cyber Directorate, by the Gordon Fund for System Engineering, by the Alon fellowship, by German-Israeli Science Foundation (GIF) Young Scientists Program, by the Taub Family Foundation as well as by the Polak Fund for Applied Research at the Technion.","","51","8","8","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2155-2487","","978-1-7281-9127-0","INT CONF COMMUN SYST","","","2021","","","","","","","254","262","","10.1109/COMSNETS51098.2021.9352944","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/COMSNETS51098.2021.9352944","","","9","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BR5TP","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000657303100058","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, in mobile systems, the mobile devices usually offer weak computation and storage resources. It prohibits the wide application of the blockchain technology. Edge computing appears with strong resources and inherent decentralization, which can provide a natural solution to overcoming the resource-insufficiency problem. However, applying edge computing directly can only relieve some storage and computation pressure. There are some other open problems, such as improving confirmation latency, throughput, and regulation. To this end, we propose an edge-computing-based lightweight blockchain framework (ECLB) for mobile systems. This paper introduces a novel set of ledger structures and designs a transaction consensus protocol to achieve superior performance. Moreover, considering the permissioned blockchain setting, we specifically utilize some cryptographic methods to design a pluggable transaction regulation module. Finally, our security analysis and performance evaluation show that ECLB can retain the security of Bitcoin-like blockchain and better performance of ledger storage cost in mobile devices, block mining computation cost, throughput, transaction confirmation latency, and transaction regulation cost.","[Xie, Qingqing; Dong, Fan] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Commun Engn, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Feng, Xia] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Automot & Traff Engn, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Jiangsu University; Jiangsu University","Xie, QQ (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Commun Engn, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.","xieqq@ujs.edu.cn","","Xie, Qingqing/0000-0001-5112-3519; Dong, Fan/0000-0002-2616-0972","National Key R&D Program of China [2020YFB1005500]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62002139, U1736216, 61902157]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20200886, BK20200888]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M651738, 2019M661753]","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation)","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (grant no. 2020YFB1005500), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 62002139, U1736216, and 61902157), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (grant numbers BK20200886 and BK20200888), and the Project funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (grant numbers 2019M651738 and 2019M661753).","","43","0","0","2","8","WILEY-HINDAWI","LONDON","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND","1939-0114","1939-0122","","SECUR COMMUN NETW","Secur.

Due to its privacy shortcomings, recently, several privacy-enhancing overlays have been deployed on Ethereum, such as non-custodial, trustless coin mixers and confidential transactions. In our privacy analysis of Ethereum's account-based model, we describe several patterns that characterize only a limited set of users and successfully apply these quasi-identifiers in address deanonymization tasks. Using Ethereum Name Service identifiers as ground truth information, we quantitatively compare algorithms in a recent branch of machine learning, the so-called graph representation learning, as well as time-of-day activity and transaction fee based user profiling techniques. As an application, we rigorously assess the privacy guarantees of the Tornado Cash coin mixer by discovering patterns of careless usage to link the mixing parties.

Recently, developer communities of blockchain technologies have started to turn their attention towards the issue of governance. The features of blockchain governance raise questions as to tensions that might arise between a strictly on-chain governance system and possible applications of off-chain governance. In this paper, we approach these questions by reflecting on a long-running debate in legal philosophy regarding the construction of a positivist legal order. First, we argue that on-chain governance shows striking similarities with Kelsen's notion of a positivist legal order, characterised by Schmitt as the machine that runs itself. Second, we illustrate some of the problems that emerged from the application of on-chain governance, with particular reference to a calamity in a blockchain-based system called the DAO. Third, we reflect on Schmitt's argument that the coalescence of private interests is a vulnerability of positivist legal systems, and accordingly posit this as an inherent vulnerability of on-chain governance of existing blockchain-based systems.","[Reijers, Wessel; Orgad, Liav] European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr, Via Boccaccio 121, I-50133 Florence, Italy; [Wuisman, Iris; Mannan, Morshed] Leiden Univ, Co Law Dept, Steenschuur 25, NL-2311 ES Leiden, Netherlands; [De Filippi, Primavera] Univ Paris II, CNRS, CERSA, 10 Rue Thenard, F-75005 Paris, France; [De Filippi, Primavera] Univ Paris II, Berkman Klein Ctr Internet & Soc, 10 Rue Thenard, F-75005 Paris, France; [De Filippi, Primavera] Harvard Univ, 10 Rue Thenard, F-75005 Paris, France; [Wray, Christopher; Rae-Looi, Vienna] Mattereum, 11 Wood End, Milton Keynes MK17 0PE, Bucks, England; [Rae-Looi, Vienna] Stanford Univ, Kozmetsky Global Collaboratory & Econ Space Agcy, 224 Panama St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cubillos Velez, Angela] Pantheon Sorbonne Univ, 24 Rue Penthievre, F-75008 Paris, France","European University Institute; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris 2 Pantheon-Assas; Universite Paris 2 Pantheon-Assas; Stanford University","Reijers, W (corresponding author), European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr, Via Boccaccio 121, I-50133 Florence, Italy.","wessel.reijers@eui.eu; i.s.wuisman@law.leidenuniv.nl; m.mannan@law.leidenuniv.nl; pdefilippi@gmail.com; chris@mattereum.com; vienna@cryptolab.net; acubillosvelez@hereslegal.com; liav.orgad@eui.eu","","","","","","","45","39","39","2","18","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0167-7411","1572-8749","","TOPOI-INT REV PHILOS","Topoi-Int.

Despite the potential impact of blockchain technology innovation in many industries, there are limited studies aimed at investigating its prospective adoption. This paper endeavours to empirically examine possible blockchain technology adoption amongst accounting and auditing professionals. The study was descriptive, following a quantitative and qualitative method. Using data from 21 accounting and auditing professionals, the results show a lack of awareness about blockchain technology. Traceability, trustworthiness, transparency, fraud detection, operational efficiency and real-time reporting are mentioned as the key benefits of blockchain technology. Despite the benefits mentioned earlier, accounting and auditing professionals are sceptical about blockchain technology readiness.

Although these stimulus policies predate the pandemic, they have been significantly boosted as many governments face large financing needs. We have been in a low interest rate environment for years and some governments have issued debt securities at negative rates. In addition, the rise of decentralized cryptocurrencies, based on blockchain technology, has created greater competition in the international monetary system and many governments have considered the creation of centralized virtual currencies, known as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). We will analyze some relevant cases, with an emphasis on the digital euro project. The methodology is based on the analysis of the evolution of monetary variables. Pearson's correlation will be used to establish some relationships between them. There is a strong similarity in the expansionary monetary policies of central banks.

Especially in the area of smart cities, blockchain technology shows great potential. The security issues of blockchain affect the construction of smart cities to varying degrees. With the rapid development of quantum computation, elliptic curves cryptosystems used in blockchain are not secure enough. This paper presents a blockchain system based on lattice cipher, which can resist the attack of quantum computation. The most challenge is that the size of public keys and signatures used by lattice cryptosystems is typically very large. As a result, each block in a blockchain can only accommodate a small number of transactions. It will affect the running speed and performance of the blockchain. For overcoming this problem, we proposed a way that we only put the hash values of public keys and signatures on the blockchain and store the complete content of them on an IPFS (interplanetary file system). In this way, the number of bytes occupied by each transaction is greatly reduced. We design a bitcoin exchange scheme to evaluate the performance of the proposed quantum-resistant blockchain system. The simulation platform is verified to be available and effective.","[Zhang, Peijun; Wang, Lianhai; Wang, Wei; Fu, Kunlun] Qilu Univ Technol, Shandong Acad Sci, Shandong Prov Key Lab Comp Networks, Shandong Comp Sci Ctr,Natl Supercomp Ctr Jinan, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jinpeng] Shandong Comp Sci Ctr, Natl Supercomp Ctr Jinan, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China","Qilu University of Technology; Qilu University of Technology","Wang, LH (corresponding author), Qilu Univ Technol, Shandong Acad Sci, Shandong Prov Key Lab Comp Networks, Shandong Comp Sci Ctr,Natl Supercomp Ctr Jinan, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China.","peijun_z@163.com; wanglh@sdas.org; weiwangscsc@163.com; 17854119961@163.com; xdyixia@163.com","","zhang, peijun/0000-0002-2359-9138; Wang, Wei/0000-0002-7604-1576; Fu, Kunlun/0000-0001-9230-7410; wang, jinpeng/0000-0001-5764-9589; Wang, Lianhai/0000-0002-5701-3465","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFB0804104, 2018YFC0830102]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61702309]; Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program [2018CXGC0701, 2019JZZY020127, 2019JZZY020129, 2019JZZY020715, 2019JZZY010134, 2019GGX105003]; Key Research and Development Program of Shandong Academy of Science; Science, Education, and Industry Integration Innovation Program of Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Science) [2020KJC-GH11, 2020KJC-ZD02]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program; Key Research and Development Program of Shandong Academy of Science; Science, Education, and Industry Integration Innovation Program of Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Science)","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFB0804104 and 2018YFC0830102), National Natural Science Foundation of China (61702309), Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program (2018CXGC0701, 2019JZZY020127, 2019JZZY020129, 2019JZZY020715, 2019JZZY010134, and 2019GGX105003), the Key Research and Development Program of Shandong Academy of Science, and the Science, Education, and Industry Integration Innovation Program of Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Science) (2020KJC-GH11 and 2020KJC-ZD02).","","29","3","3","6","26","WILEY-HINDAWI","LONDON","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND","1939-0114","1939-0122","","SECUR COMMUN NETW","Secur.

Some experts predict that cryptocurrency has changed the world forever because of its utility to transfer payments across borders with little cost or delay. Cryptocurrencies are traded with no broker and tracked on digital ledgers. Dramatic changes in the value of the cryptocurrency attract the investors' attention. Some of the have a one-day trading strategy, other investors construct crypto portfolio for a long time periods. The object of this study is value of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin on short time periods and long time periods. The subject of the study is the statistical analysis methods to assess the different cryptocurrencies investment efficiency on the different time periods. The aim of the study is to find out what cryptocurrency strategy is better to use for investors. The analysis is carried out on randomly generated periods for 8 samples cryptocurrencies value. The result of the study allows to state that investor does not need to construct crypto portfolio based on its profitability. An effective strategy is to invest money for long time periods in any cryptocurrencies whose utilities meet the investor's requirements.","[Kozlovskyi, Serhii] Vasyl Stus Donetsk Natl Univ, Dept Entrepreneurship Corp & Spatial Econ, Vinnytsia, Ukraine; [Bilenko, Daria] Univ State Fiscal Serv Ukraine, Dept Finance, Irpin, Ukraine; [Ivanyuta, Natalya] Donetsk Law Inst, Dept Civil Labour & Social Secur Law, Minist Internal Affairs Ukraine, Mariupol, Ukraine; [Tomchuk, Olesia] Vasyl Stus Donetsk Natl Univ, Dept Management & Behav Econ, Vinnytsia, Ukraine; [Prykaziuk, Nataliia] Taras Shevchenko Natl Univ Kyiv, Dept Insurance Banking & Risk Management, Kiev, Ukraine; [Lobova, Oksana] Taras Shevchenko Natl Univ Kyiv, Dept Insurance Banking & Risk Management, Kiev, Ukraine","Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Vasyl Stus Donetsk National University; University of the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine; Donetsk State University of Internal Affairs; Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Vasyl Stus Donetsk National University; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Taras Shevchenko National University Kiev; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Taras Shevchenko National University Kiev","Kozlovskyi, S (corresponding author), Vasyl Stus Donetsk Natl Univ, Dept Entrepreneurship Corp & Spatial Econ, Vinnytsia, Ukraine.","s.kozlovskyy@donnu.edu.ua; belenkodaria1@gmail.com; natalaivanuta9@gmail.com; o.tomchuk@donnu.edu.ua; pnvuniv15@ukr.net; lobova.ksu@gmail.com","Kozlovskyi, Serhii/P-3856-2017; Tomchuk, Olesya/K-3625-2018","Kozlovskyi, Serhii/0000-0003-0707-4996; Tomchuk, Olesya/0000-0002-1817-7483; Lobova, Oksana/0000-0001-5938-7244","","","","","23","0","0","4","7","ECONOMIC LABORATORY TRANSITION RESEARCH PODGORICA-ELIT","PODGORICA","DZ VASINGTONA 4-5, PODGORICA, 00000, MONTENEGRO","1800-5845","1800-6698","","MONTENEGRIN J ECON","Montenegrin J.

They have infiltrated most financial transactions and as a result cryptocurrency trade is generally considered one of the most popular and promising types of profitable investments. Nevertheless, this constantly increasing financial market is characterized by significant volatility and strong price fluctuations over a short-time period therefore, the development of an accurate and reliable forecasting model is considered essential for portfolio management and optimization. In this research, we propose a multiple-input deep neural network model for the prediction of cryptocurrency price and movement. The proposed forecasting model utilizes as inputs different cryptocurrency data and handles them independently in order to exploit useful information from each cryptocurrency separately. An extensive empirical study was performed using three consecutive years of cryptocurrency data from three cryptocurrencies with the highest market capitalization i.e., Bitcoin (BTC), Etherium (ETH), and Ripple (XRP). The detailed experimental analysis revealed that the proposed model has the ability to efficiently exploit mixed cryptocurrency data, reduces overfitting and decreases the computational cost in comparison with traditional fully-connected deep neural networks.","[Livieris, Ioannis E.; Pintelas, Panagiotis] Univ Patras, Dept Math, GR-26500 Patras, Greece; [Kiriakidou, Niki] Univ Piraeus, Dept Insurance & Stat, GR-18534 Piraeus, Greece; [Stavroyiannis, Stavros] Univ Peloponnese, Dept Accounting & Finance, GR-24100 Antikalamos, Greece","University of Patras; University of Piraeus","Livieris, IE (corresponding author), Univ Patras, Dept Math, GR-26500 Patras, Greece.","livieris@upatras.gr; niki.c.kiriakidou@gmail.com; computmath@gmail.com; ppintelas@gmail.com","Pintelas, Panagiotis/AAB-4906-2020","Pintelas, Panagiotis/0000-0001-8436-2743; Kiriakidou, Niki/0000-0003-1729-4124; Stavroyiannis, Stavros/0000-0001-8444-9371; Livieris, Ioannis/0000-0002-3996-3301","","","","","33","18","18","4","41","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2079-9292","","ELECTRONICS-SWITZ","Electronics","FEB","2021","10","3","","","","","","","287","10.3390/electronics10030287","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics10030287","","","16","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Physics","QC6RV","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000614963700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

While first interesting networks are emerging, we currently have relatively limited insights into the structure and distribution of these networks. Such knowledge, however is useful, when reasoning about possible performance improvements or the security of the network. For example, information about the different node types and implementations in the network can help when planning the distribution of critical software updates. This paper reports on a large measurement study of Lightning, a leading off-chain network, considering recorded network messages over a period of more than two years. In particular, we present an approach and classification of the node types (LND, C-Lightning and Eclair) in the network, and find that we can determine the implementation of 99.9% of nodes in our data set. We also report on geographical aspects of the Lightning network, showing that proximity is less relevant, and that the Lightning network is particularly predominant in metropolitan areas. As a contribution to the research community, we will release our experimental data together with this paper.","[Zabka, Philipp; Forster, Klaus-Tycho; Schmid, Stefan] Univ Vienna, Fac Comp Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Decker, Christian] Blockstream, Zurich, Switzerland","University of Vienna","Zabka, P (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Fac Comp Sci, Vienna, Austria.","","Foerster, Klaus-Tycho/AAA-9479-2020","Foerster, Klaus-Tycho/0000-0003-4635-4480","Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF) [ICT19-045, communication/ICT19-045]","Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF)","Research supported by the Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF) project ICT19-045 (https://www.wwtf.at/programmes/information communication/ICT19-045).","","28","0","0","0","1","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-8933-4","","","","2021","","","","","","","126","135","","10.1145/3427796.3427837","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3427796.3427837","","","10","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS1JR","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000691780200018","View Full Record in Web of Science"

One of the main perspectives of their implementation is the automation of interactions such as bets, collaterals, prediction markets, insurances. As blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, offer very strong guarantees of untampered, deterministic execution, that can be exploited as smart contracts substrate, the problem of how to provide reliable information from the outside world into the contracts becomes central. In this article, we propose a system based on a Merkle tree representation of structured documents (such as all XML), with which it is possible to generate compact proofs on the content of web documents. The proofs can then be efficiently checked on-chain by a smart contract, to trigger contract action. We provide an end-to-end proof of concept, applying it to real use case scenarios, which allows us to give an estimate of the costs.","[Bruschi, Francesco; Rana, Vincenzo; Sciuto, Donatella] Politecn Milan, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Pagani, Alessio] Alan Turing Inst, London NW1 2DB, England","Polytechnic University of Milan","Bruschi, F (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, I-20133 Milan, Italy.","francesco.bruschi@polimi.it","","Sciuto, Donatella/0000-0001-9030-6940; Pagani, Alessio/0000-0002-8404-8890; Rana, Vincenzo/0000-0001-6851-1737; BRUSCHI, FRANCESCO/0000-0001-5669-2788","","","","","29","2","2","1","4","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2021","9","","","","","","103758","103771","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3028498","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3028498","","","14","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","TQ5IC","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000678312800001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In a blockchain system (e.g., bitcoin system), the node does not rely on any central organization, and every node keeps an entire copy of the transaction database. However, this feature determines that the size of blockchain transaction database is growing rapidly. Therefore, with the continuous system operations, the node memory also needs to be expanded to support the system running. Especially in the big data era, the increasing network traffic will lead to faster transaction growth rate. This paper analyzes blockchain transaction databases and proposes a storage optimization scheme. The proposed scheme divides blockchain transaction database into cold zone and hot zone using expiration recognition method based on Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm. It can achieve storage optimization by moving unspent transaction outputs outside the in-memory transaction databases. We present the theoretical analysis on the optimization method to validate the effectiveness. Extensive experiments show our proposed method outperforms the current mechanism for the blockchain transaction databases.","[Zhang, Jingyu; Zhong, Siqi; Wang, Jin] Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp & Commun Engn, Changsha 410114, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jingyu] Natl Univ Def Technol, Sch Syst Engn, Changsha 410000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jin] Fujian Univ Technol, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Fuzhou 350000, Peoples R China; [Yu, Xiaofeng] Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China; [Alfarraj, Osama] King Saud Univ, Community Coll, Comp Sci Dept, Riyadh 11437, Saudi Arabia","Changsha University of Science & Technology; National University of Defense Technology - China; Fujian University of Technology; Nanjing University; King Saud University","Yu, XF (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China.","xiaofengyu@nju.edu.cn","Alfarraj, Osama/AAY-9635-2021; Wang, Jin/GYA-2019-2022; Zhang, Jing/GWZ-7332-2022; WANG, JINGYI/GSJ-1241-2022; wang, jing/GVT-8700-2022","","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [RSP-2020/102]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61802031, 61772454, 61811530332, 61811540410]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China [2019JGYB177]; Research Foundation of Education Bureau of Hunan Province, China [18C0216]; Practical Innovation and Entrepreneurial Ability Improvement Plan for Professional Degree Graduate students of Changsha University of Science and Technology [SJCX201971]; Hunan Graduate Scientific Research Innovation Project, China [CX2019694]; Programs of Transformation and Upgrading of Industries and Information Technologies of Jiangsu Province [JITC-1900AX2038/01]","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); Research Foundation of Education Bureau of Hunan Province, China; Practical Innovation and Entrepreneurial Ability Improvement Plan for Professional Degree Graduate students of Changsha University of Science and Technology; Hunan Graduate Scientific Research Innovation Project, China; Programs of Transformation and Upgrading of Industries and Information Technologies of Jiangsu Province","This work is supported by Researchers Supporting Project (No. RSP-2020/102) King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61802031, 61772454, 61811530332, 61811540410), the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China (No. 2019JGYB177), the Research Foundation of Education Bureau of Hunan Province, China (No. 18C0216), the Practical Innovation and Entrepreneurial Ability Improvement Plan for Professional Degree Graduate students of Changsha University of Science and Technology (No. SJCX201971) and Hunan Graduate Scientific Research Innovation Project, China (No. CX2019694).

In this paper, we focus on decreasing the block propagation time among blockchain peers under the scenario where link outages among 5G slices exist. A predictive fast consensus convergence (PFCC) scheme is proposed for mobile blockchain over 5G slicing-enabled internet of things. In PFCC, federated semi-supervised learning is used to learn the features of withdraw packets, reroutes the packets of blockchain peers, and ultimately reduces the scale of link outages quickly. With PFCC, different blockchain peers located in standalone 5G slices of IoT can transact local sensing data more efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to improve the consensus convergence speed of mobile blockchain by optimizing communications between 5G slices. Experiments shows the feasibility of proposed scheme.","[Shi, Yuan; Li, Gaolei; Wu, Jun; Li, Jianhua] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xin] 1 Middle Sch Xiangtan Cty, Xiangtan, Peoples R China","Shanghai Jiao Tong University","Shi, Y (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.","sy1256076137@sjtu.edu.cn; gaolei_li@sjtu.edu.cn; xuxinmango@aliyun.com; junwuhn@sjtu.edu.cn; lijh888@sjtu.edu.cn","li, Gaolei/E-9861-2017","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [U20B2048, 61972255]; Shanghai Sailing Program [21YF1421700]; Special Fund for Inudstrial Transfomation and Upgrading Development of Shanghai [GYQJ-2018-3-03]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Sailing Program; Special Fund for Inudstrial Transfomation and Upgrading Development of Shanghai","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. U20B2048 and 61972255, Shanghai Sailing Program under Grant No. 21YF1421700 and Special Fund for Inudstrial Transfomation and Upgrading Development of Shanghai Under Grant No. GYQJ-2018-3-03.","","21","0","0","1","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2334-0983","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8104-2","IEEE GLOB COMM CONF","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685419","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685419","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BT0PJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000790747202027","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, it also gives incentive to malicious users who would like to break the system or take advantage of it (steal money, hide some information stored in the ledger, isolate a particular node from the rest of the network, and so forth). Thus, research focusing on overcoming potential attacks to distributed ledgers is required. In this article, we focus on attacks that damage underlying networks of distributed ledgers. Underlying networks offer useful communication primitives such as an atomic broadcast, however, such attacks may degrade the property of the primitives and make distributed ledgers relying on the primitives no longer work. Hence we should design algorithms to make the distributed ledgers still work even when some attacks degrade the primitives. As the first study for such situations, we consider a problem to implement distributed ledgers tolerating the degradation of an underlying atomic broadcast service that distributed ledgers are relying on. We consider the case where the uniform agreement property of the atomic broadcast is degraded, and propose new algorithms that could ensure to reach eventual consistency despite degraded atomic broadcast.","[Benassy, Gregory; Ooshita, Fukuhito; Inoue, Michiko] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Div Informat Sci, Ikoma, Nara, Japan; [Benassy, Gregory] Telecom SudParis, Sch Engn, Evry, France","Nara Institute of Science & Technology; IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; Institut Polytechnique de Paris","Inoue, M (corresponding author), Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Div Informat Sci, Ikoma, Nara, Japan.","kounoe@is.naist.jp","Inoue, Michiko/AAX-8442-2021","Inoue, Michiko/0000-0002-9837-5147","","","","","19","0","0","2","3","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1532-0626","1532-0634","","CONCURR COMP-PRACT E","Concurr.

This advancement has brought up a critical challenge that public blockchain systems face, which is scalability. Most of the currently deployed systems fail to cope with increasing usage. In order to provide the promised security guarantees, large delays and high usage fees are imposed for submitted transactions and thus widespread adoption of the technology is hindered. A number of different approaches have been proposed to increase the capacity of blockchain systems with respect to processing transactions. The present survey focuses on one of the most popular ones, that of state channels, and to the extent of our knowledge constitutes the first collective survey of research in this field. An extensive analysis of relevant publications is conducted and a general view on the domain is provided. We have identified the limitations discussed through all relevant research efforts along with the various features that differentiate proposed designs. A comparison between retrieved papers is carried out on the basis of those limitations and features. Finally, future research directions are analysed while the role of state channels in the general public blockchain ecosystem is also discussed.","[Negka, Lydia D.] Univ Thessaly, Dept Comp Sci & Biomed Informat, Lamia 35131, Greece; [Spathoulas, Georgios P.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Informat Secur & Commun Technol, N-2802 Gjovik, Norway","Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)","Spathoulas, GP (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Informat Secur & Commun Technol, N-2802 Gjovik, Norway.","georgios.spathoulas@ntnu.no","Negka, Lydia/ABG-8112-2021","Negka, Lydia/0000-0002-7954-4240; Spathoulas, Georgios/0000-0003-2947-486X","","","","","53","3","3","3","5","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2021","9","","","","","","160277","160298","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3131419","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3131419","","","22","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","XM6DN","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000728915300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

While the characteristics of permissioned blockchains are appealing to a wide range of large-scale data management systems, these systems, have to satisfy four main requirements: confidentiality, verifiability, performance, and scalability. Various approaches have been developed in industry and academia to satisfy these requirements with varying assumptions and costs. The focus of this tutorial is on presenting many of these techniques while highlighting the trade-offs among them. We demonstrate the practicality of such techniques in real-life by presenting three different applications, i.e., supply chain management, large-scale databases, and multi-platform crowdworking environments, and show how those techniques can be utilized to meet the requirements of such applications.","[Amiri, Mohammad Javad] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Agrawal, Divyakant; El Abbadi, Amr] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","University of Pennsylvania; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara","Amiri, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.","mjamiri@seas.upenn.edu; agrawal@cs.ucsb.edu; amr@cs.ucsb.edu","","","NSF [CNS-1703560, CNS-1815733]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work is funded by NSF grants CNS-1703560 and CNS-1815733.","","56","2","2","4","9","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0730-8078","","978-1-4503-8343-1","INT CONF MANAGE DATA","","","2021","","","","","","","2813","2820","","10.1145/3448016.3457539","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3448016.3457539","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS6FP","","Bronze","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000747673800243","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The public chain represented by Bitcoin and Ethereum only realizes the limited anonymity of user identity, and the transaction amount is open to the whole network, resulting in user privacy leakage. Based on the existing anonymous technology, the concealment of the sender, receiver, amount of the transaction, and does not disclose any information, which makes the supervision difficult. Therefore, the design of blockchain scheme with privacy protection and supervision functions is of great significance. In this paper, a blockchain transaction model with both privacy and supervision function is proposed. It uses probability encryption to realize the hiding of the true identity of the blockchain transaction, and uses the commitment scheme and zero-knowledge proof technology to realize the privacy protection and guarantee legitimacy verification of the transaction. With the use of encryption technology, the regulators can supervise blockchain transactions without storing the users' information, which greatly reduces the pressure on storage, computing and key management. In addition, it does not rely on specific consensus mechanism and can be used as an independent module. The security performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme has great practicability and has potential application in many fields.","[Xue, Zhiyuan] Shandong Univ, Sch Software, Jinan 250101, Peoples R China; [Wang, Miao; Zhang, Yunfeng] Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiuyue; Liu, Peide] Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yunfeng] Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Shandong Key Lab Blockchain Finance, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China","Shandong University; Shandong University of Finance & Economics; Shandong University of Finance & Economics; Shandong University of Finance & Economics","Liu, PD (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China.","peide.liu@gmail.com","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61972227]; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2019MF051, ZR201808160102]; Fostering Project of Dominant Discipline and Talent Team of Shandong Province Higher Education Institutions","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Fostering Project of Dominant Discipline and Talent Team of Shandong Province Higher Education Institutions","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61972227) , the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (Grant Nos.

The model is a collection of fuzzy functional rules in which the rule base structure and the parameters of the rules evolve simultaneously as data are input. The evolving nature of the method allows continuous model adaptation using the stream interval input data. The method employs participatory learning to cluster the interval input data recursively, constructs a fuzzy rule for each cluster, uses the weighted recursive least squares to update the parameters of the rule consequent intervals, and returns an interval-valued output. The method is evaluated using actual data to model and forecast the daily lowest and highest prices of the four most traded cryptocurrencies, BitCoin, Ethereum, XRP, and LiteCoin. The performance of the adaptive interval fuzzy modeling is compared with the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, long short-term memory neural network, autoregressive integrated moving average, exponential smoothing state model, and the naive random walk methods. Results show that the suggested interval fuzzy model outperforms all these methods in predicting prices in the digital coin market, especially when considering directional accuracy measure.","[Maciel, Leandro] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Econ Business & Accounting, Dept Business, Av Prof Luciano Gualberto 908, BR-05508010 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Ballini, Rosangela] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Econ, Dept Econ Theory, R Pitagoras 353, BR-13083857 Campinas, Brazil; [Gomide, Fernando] Univ Estadual Campinas, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Dept Comp Engn & Automat, Av Albert Einstein 400, BR-13083852 Campinas, SP, Brazil","Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Universidade Estadual de Campinas","Maciel, L (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Econ Business & Accounting, Dept Business, Av Prof Luciano Gualberto 908, BR-05508010 Sao Paulo, Brazil.","leandromaciel@usp.br; ballini@unicamp.br; gomide@unicamp.br","Maciel, Leandro/B-1046-2015; Ballini, Rosangela/B-1560-2015","Maciel, Leandro/0000-0002-1900-7179; Ballini, Rosangela/0000-0001-6683-4380; Gomide, Fernando/0000-0001-5716-4282","Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [304456/2020-9, 302467/2019-0]","Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ))","The authors are grateful to the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) for Grants 304456/2020-9 (Leandro Maciel) and 302467/2019-0 (Fernando Gomide).

Despite the tremendous success of blockchain, it is still vulnerable due to the complexity of distributed execution environment. Malicious attacks that exploit these vulnerabilities can lead to serious losses. Common Knowledge Base (CKB) is a public permissionless blockchain and the base layer of Nervos Network, which is gaining popularity in recent years. It adopts a novel consensus protocol to overcome two shortcomings of Bitcoin: the low transaction processing throughput and the vulnerability to selfish mining attacks. Considering the high-security requirements in CKB application scenarios, it is essential to provide formalization and verification of the safety and security properties of the CKB blockchain. In this paper, we provide a formal model of CKB consensus protocol in the theorem prover Coq. Fundamental components of the protocol are implemented, including the block structure, the two-step transaction confirmation mechanism, and the peer-to-peer asynchronous network. We also use Coq to establish the quiescent consistency property of the consensus protocol, which is a kind of eventual consensus that all the participants agree on the same ledger when there are no inflight messages.","[Luan, Xiaokun; Sun, Meng] Peking Univ, Sch Math Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Peking University","Luan, XK (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Math Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.","luanxiaokun@pku.edu.cn; sunm@pku.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [62172019, 61772038]; Guangdong Science and Technology Department [2018B010107004]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Science and Technology Department","This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant no. 62172019, 61772038 and the Guangdong Science and Technology Department (Grant no. 2018B010107004).","","30","0","0","0","0","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","2693-938X","2693-9371","978-1-6654-7836-6","IEEE I C SQRS-C","","","2021","","","","","","","660","667","","10.1109/QRS-C55045.2021.00100","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/QRS-C55045.2021.00100","","","8","Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT2HW","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000808814500088","View Full Record in Web of Science"

ICOs emerged as a financial technology (FinTech) development and use blockchain technology. As a novel form of crowdfunding, ICOs are public offerings that can be used to raise capital for entrepreneurs and also have the potential to be a new financing method for tourism ventures with financing challenges. Although ICOs can represent a very substantial alternative financing method for today's innovative business models, the phenomenon seems to be poorly understood. With this in mind, this study highlights the importance of blockchain technology and thus ICOs as an alternative financing tool for the tourism industry. In this context, 49 ICOs that ended between 05 July 2017 and 27 January 2021 were analysed by applying the logistic regression analysis method. The results show that the most essential signals of the probability of success of a tourism ICO are human capital, duration, acceptance of Bitcoin as the most popular cryptocurrency, and bonuses offered as an incentive instrument. The findings have useful practical implications for the determinants of ICOs' success for both tourism entrepreneurs and contributors of tourism ICOs.","[Bulut, Esra] Trabzon Univ, Vocat Sch Tourism & Hotel Management, Fatih Campus Sogutlu Akcaabat Trabzon, Trabzon, Turkey","Trabzon University","Bulut, E (corresponding author), Trabzon Univ, Vocat Sch Tourism & Hotel Management, Fatih Campus Sogutlu Akcaabat Trabzon, Trabzon, Turkey.","ebulut@trabzon.edu.tr","","","","","","","45","2","2","10","42","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1368-3500","1747-7603","","CURR ISSUES TOUR","Curr.

However, the actual prevalence of cryptocurrency ownership and usage, the users' sociodemographics, the motives to buy, and the popularity of and knowledge about cryptocurrencies have not been sufficiently researched. Based on a representative online survey among 3864 Germans, we find that 83% of the respondents are aware of the phenomenon, yet the respondents' self-assessed knowledge about cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology is limited. 9.2% of the respondents owned cryptocurrencies at the time of the survey; another 9.1% have owned cryptocurrencies in the past. Cryptocurrency users tend to be young, male, well-educated and well-off. Ownership is often associated with long-term investments, and 62% of the respondents state that their ownership is ideologically motivated. The empirical analysis discloses that a major driver of ownership is knowledge about cryptocurrencies, mediated by trust. There is some discrepancy between the actual and perceived usage domains of cryptocurrencies, which reflects the polarization of the phenomenon.

While by design, blockchains provide no means to securely communicate with external systems, numerous attempts towards trustless cross-chain communication have been proposed over the years. Today, cross-chain communication (CCC) plays a fundamental role in cryptocurrency exchanges, scalability efforts via sharding, extension of existing systems through sidechains, and bootstrapping of new blockchains. Unfortunately, existing proposals are designed ad-hoc for specific use-cases, making it hard to gain confidence in their correctness and composability. We provide the first systematic exposition of cross-chain communication protocols. We formalize the underlying research problem and show that CCC is impossible without a trusted third party, contrary to common beliefs in the blockchain community. With this result in mind, we develop a framework to design new and evaluate existing CCC protocols, focusing on the inherent trust assumptions thereof, and derive a classification covering the field of cross-chain communication to date. We conclude by discussing open challenges for CCC research and the implications of interoperability on the security and privacy of blockchains.","[Zamyatin, Alexei; Knottenbelt, William J.] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Zamyatin, Alexei] Interlay, Hartlebury, England; [Al-Bassam, Mustafa] UCL, London, England; [Zindros, Dionysis] Univ Athens, Athens, Greece; [Kokoris-Kogias, Eleftherios] IST Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria; [Moreno-Sanchez, Pedro] Novi Res, Tampere, Finland; [Kiayias, Aggelos] IMDEA Software Inst, Madrid, Spain; [Kiayias, Aggelos] IOHK, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kokoris-Kogias, Eleftherios] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Imperial College London; University of London; University College London; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Institute of Science & Technology - Austria; University of Edinburgh","Zamyatin, A (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, London, England.;Zamyatin, A (corresponding author), Interlay, Hartlebury, England.","alexei@interlay.io","","","FFG [Bridge 1 858561 SESC, Bridge 1 864738]; Christian Doppler Laboratory for Security and Quality Improvement in the Production System Lifecycle (CDL-SQI); COMET; Chaincode Labs through the project SLN; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) through the Meitner program [M-2608]; Alan Turing Institute; Binance Research Fellowship","FFG; Christian Doppler Laboratory for Security and Quality Improvement in the Production System Lifecycle (CDL-SQI); COMET; Chaincode Labs through the project SLN; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) through the Meitner program(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Alan Turing Institute; Binance Research Fellowship","This research was funded by Bridge 1 858561 SESC; Bridge 1 864738 PR4DLT (all FFG); the Christian Doppler Laboratory for Security and Quality Improvement in the Production System Lifecycle (CDL-SQI); the competence center SBA-K1 funded by COMET; Chaincode Labs through the project SLN: Scalability for the Lightning Network; and by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) through the Meitner program (project M-2608).; Mustafa Al-Bassam is funded by a scholarship from the Alan Turing Institute.

It can be said that Blockchain is an immutable ledger, where systems can store transactions, documents, history, countless data generated in any process. In Brazil, an animal sanitary control platform called Plataforma de Defesa Sanitaria Animal (PDSA-RS) was recently proposed and is widely used in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Actually, the PDSA-RS uses a centered server with relevant information for the animal sanitary control process. This work presents the process of defining and integrating the PDSA-RS with a private Blockchain managed by a software architecture. The main goal of this integration is to give traceability, immutability and transparency in the existing process and the data generated in the certification of poultry establishments that are part of the animal sanitary control. In the evaluation of the integration process, it was possible to observe that it the blockchain extension offered persistence. anonymity and auditability of the information related to the animal sanitary control.","[Descovi, Glenio; Machado, Alencar] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Technol Ctr, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Ebling, Denilson; Machado, Alencar] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Polytech Coll, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Maran, Vinicius] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Lab Ubiquitous Mobile & Appl Comp LUMAC, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil","Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM); Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM); Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM)","Descovi, G (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Maria, Technol Ctr, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.","","","","FUNDESA; Research and Development of Innovative Technologies Focused on Agribusiness [051568]","FUNDESA; Research and Development of Innovative Technologies Focused on Agribusiness","This work is part of Research and Development of Innovative Technologies Focused on Agribusiness (n. 051568) and is financed by FUNDESA.","","16","0","0","0","0","SCITEPRESS","SETUBAL","AV D MANUELL, 27A 2 ESQ, SETUBAL, 2910-595, PORTUGAL","","","978-989-758-509-8","","","","2021","","","","","","","305","312","","10.5220/0010483303050312","http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0010483303050312","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS9PM","","hybrid","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000783390600032","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Despite these constraints, there is considerable research in this area, outlining the benefits of employing Blockchain in IoT applications. Such benefits relate to ensuring that the applications and their data are secure, and integrity is maintained. However, the relatively low TPS rate is still an impediment for the widespread adoption of Blockchain in IoT. This research seeks to explore whether Solana, a new Blockchain technology designed to have a high TPS rate, can overcome this challenge. Can the Solana Blockchain achieve a TPS rate higher than that achieved in other works in the literature? Can a sufficient rate be achieved that could help Blockchain technologies become an enabler in the loT industry? These are the questions that this research aims to answer. Our experiments conducted on an application coded in Rust on Solana Blockchain demonstrated that it can successfully achieve a 663 TPS rate. Consequently, we conclude that Solana, by overcoming the aforementioned TPS rate issue, could advance the further adoption of Blockchain in la context.","[Duffy, Fintan] Dublin City Univ, Sch Comp, Dublin, Ireland; [Bendechache, Malika] Dublin City Univ, Sch Comp, ADAPT Lero, Dublin, Ireland; [Tal, Irina] Dublin City Univ, Sch Comp, Lero, Dublin, Ireland","Dublin City University; Dublin City University; Dublin City University","Duffy, F (corresponding author), Dublin City Univ, Sch Comp, Dublin, Ireland.","fintan.duffy23@mail.dcu.ie; malika.bendechache@dcu.ie; irina.tal@dcu.ie","","","Science Foundation Ireland [13/RC/2094_P2]; European Regional Development Fund through the Southern and Eastern Regional Operational Programme; ADAPT Centre for Digital Content Technology [13/RC/2106]","Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation IrelandEuropean Commission); European Regional Development Fund through the Southern and Eastern Regional Operational Programme; ADAPT Centre for Digital Content Technology","This work was supported, in part, by Science Foundation Ireland grant 13/RC/2094_P2 and co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund through the Southern and Eastern Regional Operational Programme to Lero -the Irish Software Research Centre (www.lero.ie) and the ADAPT Centre for Digital Content Technology (www.adaptcentre.ie) [grant number 13/RC/2106].

As far as we know, there is no safe lightweight wallet in hyperledger fabric. To solve the problem, we proposed a Trustzone-based Secure Lightweight Wallet for Hyperledger Fabric (hereafter referred to as TSLWHF). Firstly, we designed an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) set of transactions under blockchain and a signature verification mechanism for transactions, which made it possible to implement the lightweight wallet in hyperledger fabric. Then, we implemented a reliable protection mechanism for private keys and wallet's address, which solved the problem that users' information might be stolen or replaced. Meanwhile, the transaction verification results are guaranteed not to be tampered by hackers through verifying transactions in Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and encrypting local block headers. Finally, to demonstrate utility, we deployed the system in hyperledger fabric and trustzone. Experiments showed that the wallet reduces the size of locally stored data while protecting the security of user's assets. The time spent on TSLWHF to execute a transaction is 0.589s, which improves transaction's performance compared to Bitcoin wallet. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

At the same time, the blockchain technology has also attracted researchers' increasing attention, leading to a large number of scientific outputs that made significant contributions to blockchain research. However, few attempts can be found to investigate the development of blockchain based on the literature in this area. Therefore, this paper focuses on blockchain research by introducing bibliometric methods and comprehensively analyzes its status quo, emerging trends, and development path. Based on the above research, this paper draws two main conclusions. First, we made a comprehensive investigation of blockchain research in the past five years and then found that the main research directions in this area are Bitcoin, digital currency, and Fintech. Second, the development of blockchain research generally presents a trend of pi-transformation based on the main path analysis. The above studies provide a brief view for beginners who want to learn blockchain research in a direct way and contribute to extend the theoretical foundation of blockchain research by giving a comprehensive bibliometric analysis.","[Meng, Sun; Chen, Yan; Zhou, Wei] Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Kunming 650051, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Yu, Dejian] Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 211815, Peoples R China","Yunnan University of Finance & Economics; Nanjing Audit University","Chen, Y (corresponding author), Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Kunming 650051, Yunnan, Peoples R China.","mengsun_2004@163.com; chenyan18@stu.ynufe.edu.cn; zw453@163.com; yudejian62@126.com","","","Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [18YJC900118]","Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China","This work was supported by the Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China (no. 18YJC900118).","","61","2","2","3","14","HINDAWI LTD","LONDON","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","1024-123X","1563-5147","","MATH PROBL ENG","Math.

New protocols seek to improve the performances of blockchain systems. In particular, the energy consumption of blockchains has been particularly decried. Unfortunately, those new proposals are often evaluated with ad hoc tools and experimental environments. Therefore, reproducibility and comparison of these new contributions with the state of the art of blockchain technologies are complicated. To the best of our knowledge, only a few tools partially address the design of a generic benchmarking of blockchain technologies (e.g., load generation). This paper introduces BCTMark, a generic framework for benchmarking blockchain technologies on an emulated network in a reproducible way. Based on this novel framework, we studied a key aspect of modern blockchains' energy consumption: smart-contract execution. Based on experiments and the analysis of one year of real-world Ethereum transactions, we measured and modeled smart-contracts' energy consumption on Ethereum. Furthermore, this study details how the replication of contract calls execution can impact their energy cost. In particular, we give insights on the energy consumed by smart-contracts on Ethereum over one year.","[Saingre, Dimitri; Ledoux, Thomas; Menaud, Jean-Marc] IMT Atlantique, LS2N, INRIA, 4 Rue Alfred Kastler, F-44307 Nantes, France","IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; IMT Atlantique; Inria","Saingre, D (corresponding author), IMT Atlantique, LS2N, INRIA, 4 Rue Alfred Kastler, F-44307 Nantes, France.","dimitri.saingre@imt-atlantique.fr; thomas.ledoux@imt-atlantique.fr; jean-marc.menaud@imt-atlantique.fr","","SAINGRE, Dimitri/0000-0002-2723-7740","HYDDA FSN project","HYDDA FSN project","This paper has been financed by the HYDDA FSN project.","","39","0","0","3","9","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1386-7857","1573-7543","","CLUSTER COMPUT","Cluster Comput.","AUG","2022","25","4","","","","","2819","2837","","10.1007/s10586-021-03441-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10586-021-03441-x","","NOV 2021","19","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science","2Y0FN","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000721687000006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Therefore, this study proposes to build on the success of Thailand's National Single Window (THAINSW) gateway document interchange architecture (DIA) and further expand its availability to a much larger network of e-Government participants using Blockchain architecture. Therefore, the authors set how to investigate how and where Blockchain technology could be implemented in order to support of Thailand's 4.0 and digital economy visions. In addition to the qualitative analysis of the literature, the authors used input from a panel of 25 Thai experts to develop a foundation for the analysis based on Sathosi Nakamoto's seven Blockchain disciplines. This analysis was enhanced from the authors' own experiences in real-world Blockchain implementations. Results revealed that Blockchain is a highly innovative approach to secure transaction execution, information storage, performing functions, and establishing trust in an open architectural environment.

The validation of the information stored therein as well as the guarantee of its immutability can be achieved without the need of a central authority. Proof-of-work is the maximum expression of the distributed nature of such systems, and requires miners to spend a large amount of energy to secure the blockchain. The cost is mostly paid by the end-users that offer fees to support the validation of their transactions. In general, higher fees correspond to shorter validation delays. However, given the limited throughput of the system and variability of the workload, the fee one needs to offer to satisfy a certain requirement on the validation delay strongly depends on the intensity of the workload that, in turns, is subject to high variability. In this work, we propose a time series analysis of the workload of Bitcoin blockchain and compare the accuracy of Facebook Prophet model with a ARIMA model. We take into account the periodicity of the workload and show by simulations how these predictions, accompanied with their confidence intervals, can be used to estimate the confirmation delays of the transactions given the offered fees.","[Malakhov, Ivan; Gaetan, Carlo; Marin, Andrea; Rossi, Sabina] Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Via Torino 155, I-30173 Venice, Italy","Universita Ca Foscari Venezia","Malakhov, I (corresponding author), Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Via Torino 155, I-30173 Venice, Italy.","ivan.malakhov@unive.it; gaetan@unive.it; marin@unive.it; sabina.rossi@unive.it","Gaetan, Carlo/P-3322-2019","Gaetan, Carlo/0000-0002-1361-9959; Rossi, Sabina/0000-0002-1189-4439; Malakhov, Ivan/0000-0002-1176-3543; Marin, Andrea/0000-0002-5958-1204","","","","","14","1","1","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-91825-5; 978-3-030-91824-8","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2021","13104","","","","","","3","21","","10.1007/978-3-030-91825-5_1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-91825-5_1","","","19","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Mathematics","BS7SJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000766389200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

These links allow us to attribute information (e.g., aliases, IP addresses) to 21.19% of the BTC addresses contributing to their deanonymization. Further, these deanonymization results suggest that the security and privacy of LN payments are weaker than commonly believed, with LN users being at the mercy of as few as five actors that control 36 nodes and over 33% of the total capacity.

In contrast to Bitcoin and similar public blockchains, which rely on Proof-of-Work for consensus and are deployed on thousands of geo-distributed nodes, business-tobusiness use-cases (such as supply chain management and banking) require significantly fewer nodes, cheaper consensus, and are often deployed in controlled environments with fast networking and low latency. However, permissioned blockchains often follow the architectural thinking behind their WAN-oriented public relatives, which results in end-to-end latency several orders of magnitude higher than necessary. In this work, we propose a fundamental shift in permissioned blockchain design, eliminating blocks in favor of processing transactions in a streaming fashion. This results in a drastically lower latency without reducing throughput or forfeiting reliability and security guarantees. To demonstrate the wide applicability of our design, we prototype StreamChain based on the Hyperledger Fabric, and show that it delivers latency two orders of magnitude lower than Fabric, while sustaining similar throughput. This performance makes StreamChain a potential alternative to traditional databases and, thanks to its streaming paradigm, enables further research, for instance, around reducing latency through relying on modern programmable hardware accelerators.","[Kuhring, Lucas] Otto GmbH & Co KG, Hamburg, Germany; [Istvan, Zsolt] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany; [Sorniotti, Alessandro] IBM Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Vukolic, Marko] Protocol Labs, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kuhring, Lucas; Istvan, Zsolt] IMDEA Software Inst, Madrid, Spain","Technical University of Darmstadt; International Business Machines (IBM)","Kuhring, L (corresponding author), Otto GmbH & Co KG, Hamburg, Germany.;Kuhring, L (corresponding author), IMDEA Software Inst, Madrid, Spain.","lucas.kuhring@otto.de; zsolt.istvan@cs.tu-darmstadt.de; aso@zurich.ibm.com; marko@protocol.ai","","","European Union [842956]","European Union(European Commission)","This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 842956.","","34","0","0","1","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-1760-0","","","","2021","","","","","","","130","139","","10.1109/BLOCKCHAIN53845.2021.00027","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BLOCKCHAIN53845.2021.00027","","","10","","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","","BS9CN","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000779214600016","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We propose a recoverable private key scheme for consortium blockchain based on the verifiable secret sharing which can enable the user's private key in the consortium blockchain to be securely recovered through a verifiable secret sharing method. In our secret sharing scheme, users use the biometric keys to encrypt shares, and the preset committer peers in the consortium blockchain act as the participants to store the users' private key shares. Due to the particularity of the biometric key, only the user can complete the correct secret recovery. Our comparisons with the existing mnemonic systems or the multi-signature schemes have shown that our scheme can allow users to recover their private keys without storing the passwords accurately. Hence, our scheme can improve the account security and recoverability of the data-sharing systems across physical and virtual platforms that use blockchain technology.","[Li, Guojia; You, Lin; Hu, Gengran; Hu, Liqin] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Sch Cyberspace Secur, Hangzhou 310000, Peoples R China","Hangzhou Dianzi University","You, L (corresponding author), Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Sch Cyberspace Secur, Hangzhou 310000, Peoples R China.","liguojia@hdu.edu.cn; mryoulin@gmail.com; grhu@hdu.edu.cn; huliqin@hdu.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61772166]; Key Program of the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang province of China [LZ17F020002]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Program of the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang province of China","This research is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61772166) and the Key Program of the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang province of China (No. LZ17F020002) .","","27","0","0","11","22","KSII-KOR SOC INTERNET INFORMATION","GANGNAM-GU","KOR SCI & TECHNOL CTR, 409 ON 4TH FLR, MAIN BLDG, 635-4 YEOKSAM 1-DONG, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL 00000, SOUTH KOREA","1976-7277","","","KSII T INTERNET INF","KSII Trans.

The payment channel increases the transaction throughput of two parties to a level that is only limited by their network bandwidth. Recent proposals focus on extending the two-party payment channel to the N-party payment hub. Unfortunately, none of them can achieve efficiency, flexibility in the absence of a trusted third-party. In this paper, we propose Garou, a secure N-party payment hub that allows multiple parties to perform secure off-chain coin transfers. Except in the case of disputes, participants within the payment hub can make concurrent and direct coin transfers with each other without the involvement of the blockchain or any third-party intermediaries. This allows Garou to achieve both high-performance and flexibility. If all participants keep online, Garou guarantees all honest users' balance security against strong adversarial capabilities. To demonstrate the feasibility of the Garou protocol, we develop a proof of concept prototype for the Ethereum network. Experimental evaluations show that, with 300 participants and without disputes, that the maximum transaction throughput of Garou is 20x higher than that of state-of-the-art payment hubs.","[Ye, Yongjie; Ren, Zhifeng; Zhang, Jingjing; Wu, Weigang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Ren, Zhifeng; Zhang, Jingjing; Wu, Weigang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Big Data Anal & Proc, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Luo, Xiapu] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University","Wu, WG (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.;Wu, WG (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Big Data Anal & Proc, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.","yeyj6@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; renzhf@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; csxluo@comp.polyu.edu.hk; zhangjj43@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; wuweig@mail.sysu.edu.cn","","Wu, Weigang/0000-0002-4714-7021; Ren, Zhifeng/0000-0001-7988-001X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1711263, U1811461, U1801266]; Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [2018B030312002]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province)","This research is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1711263, U1811461, U1801266), and Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (2018B030312002).","","46","2","2","3","6","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","1932-4537","","","IEEE T NETW SERV MAN","IEEE Trans.

However, there are major challenges in scaling up the throughput of such networks. Lightning network and Spider network are alternates that build bidirectional payment channels on top of cryptocurrency networks using smart contracts, to enable fast transactions that bypass the Blockchain. In this article, we study the problem of routing transactions in such a payment processing network. We first propose a Stochastic model to study such a system, as opposed to a fluid model that is studied in the literature. Each link in such a model is a two-sided queue, and unlike classical queues, such queues are not stable unless there is an external control. We propose a notion of stability for the payment processing network consisting of such two-sided queues using the notion of on-chain rebalancing. We then characterize the capacity region and propose a throughput optimal algorithm that stabilizes the system under any load within the capacity region. The stochastic model enables us to study closed-loop policies, which typically have better queuing/delay performance than the open-loop policies (or static split rules) studied in the literature.

With the rise in cryptocurrency transactions, the need for smart contracts has also increased. Smart contracts, in a nutshell, are digitally executed contracts wherein some parties execute a common goal. The main problem with most of the current smart contracts is that there is no privacy for a party's input to the contract from either the blockchain or the other parties. Our research builds on the Hawk project that provides transaction privacy along with support for smart contracts. However, Hawk relies on a special trusted party known as a manager, which must be trusted not to leak each party's input to the smart contract. In this paper, we present a practical private smart contract protocol that replaces the manager with an MPC protocol such that the function to be executed by the MPC protocol is relatively lightweight, involving little overhead added to the smart contract function, and uses practical sigma protocols and homomorphic commitments to prove to the blockchain that the sum of the incoming balances to the smart contract matches the sum of the outgoing balances.

Semi-structured in-depth interviews were initiated to generate data from three motor companies with purposively selected 30 participants. Findings revealed that auto employees who are not electrically inclined are self-encouraged to seek technical and electrical careers to secure a future in the automobile industry. These workers may also pursue careers in computer science. Many autoworkers have supplemented and stabilized their incomes through FOREX and Bitcoin mining trading. Simultaneously, these employees are receptive to changing careers in agriculture. Again, autoworkers prefer self-employment to the job insecurity associated with industrial positions. In general, motivation for upskilling for a future job in the automotive industry is low. Before the Covid-19 crisis, organizations were adopting new ways of doing business that tend to unready workers' readiness. This trend increased very steeply during the pandemic. Retraining and reskilling as steps for workers' readiness to face job automation are not outright answers that will lead to job security. Nonetheless, automobile workers have to treat their careers as businesses and invest in skills under the umbrella of non-automatable technical and non-technical job families.","[Chigbu, Bianca Ifeoma; Nekhwevha, Fhulu H.] Univ Ft Hare, Dept Sociol, PB X1314, ZA-5700 Alice, South Africa","University of Fort Hare","Chigbu, BI (corresponding author), Univ Ft Hare, Dept Sociol, P Bag X1314, ZA-5700 Alice, South Africa.","bianca7h@yahoo.com; fnekhwevha@ufh.ac.za","Chigbu, Bianca Ifeoma/AED-7897-2022","Chigbu, Bianca Ifeoma/0000-0003-4029-9580","National Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences (NIHSS); Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA) [APS16/1157]","National Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences (NIHSS); Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA)","This study was funded by the National Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences (NIHSS) , in collaboration with the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA) .

The first purpose is to examine the perception of Islamic finance experts and Shariah scholars on the Islamic cryptocurrency (i.e., GOLDX and OneGram). The question is whether it has a role in reconciling cryptocurrency in Islamic finance. The second is to introduce the new Islamic cryptocurrency to serve these rich Islamic populaces. The study used a qualitative research approach by conducting interviews to explore the Islamic scholars' views on the framework of the new Islamic cryptocurrency. The scholars have been deemed to meet particular requirements of having comprehensive knowledge and have extensive experience in both the Islamic Shariah and cryptocurrency. Accordingly, the number of such scholars was limited, and eventually, with the access offered only to five scholars from different Islamic countries. We thoroughly analyzed the collected data from the interviews. The findings reveal that Islamic law is absent on the essential models for the conventional cryptocurrency utilization(such as bitcoin) as either a legitimate or illicit apparatus exchange device. Consequently, introducing new Islamic cryptocurrencies is to reconcile cryptocurrencies such as GOLDX and OneGram. They will play a vital role in attracting more than 1.5 billion Muslims around the globe to enter the world of cryptocurrency.","[Abdeldayem, Marwan Mohamed] Cairo Univ, Business & Finance, Giza, Egypt; [Abdeldayem, Marwan Mohamed] Appl Sci Univ ASU, Coll Adm Sci, POB 5055, Manama, Bahrain; [Al Dulaimi, Saeed Hameed] Appl Sci Univ ASU, Business & HR Management Coll Adm Sci, POB 5055, Manama, Bahrain; [Al Dulaimi, Fuaad Hameed] Bait Al Mashura Finance Consultat, Islamic Finance, Doha, Qatar","Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University","Abdeldayem, MM (corresponding author), Cairo Univ, Business & Finance, Giza, Egypt.;Abdeldayem, MM (corresponding author), Appl Sci Univ ASU, Coll Adm Sci, POB 5055, Manama, Bahrain.","Marwan.abdeldayem@asu.edu.bh; Saeed.aldulaimi@asu.edu.bh; f.dulaimi@b-mashura.com","Abdeldayem, Marwan/AAE-7466-2020","Abdeldayem, Marwan/0000-0002-9103-9802","","","","","40","4","4","1","8","UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS","RIJEKA","IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA","1331-8004","1846-7520","","ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE","Zb.

Many applications of blockchains are related to the exchange of tokens, ie. valuable units that can be native, such as bitcoin and ether, or implemented in software, through smart contracts. Standards ensure token interoperability among decentralized applications of a certain platform, but they are general enough to be used in other contexts as well. A trend in blockchain is to implement such standards from a platform to another one, easing the design challenges with trusted and widely-used specifications. Exploiting the target language semantic can result in technological advantages with more efficient contracts. This paper presents a re-engineering of OpenZeppelin's implementation of the ERC-20 standard for fungible tokens on Takamaka, a subset of Java for programming smart contracts in the Hotmoka blockchain. It starts with a literal translation from Solidity to Takamaka, but then describes a novel implementation for making snapshots of tokens, based on tree maps, that is possible in Java, but not in Solidity, and shows that it is much more efficient than the literal translation in Java from Solidity, within the Java Virtual Machine.","[Crosara, Marco; Olivieri, Luca; Spoto, Fausto; Tagliaferro, Fabio] Univ Verona, Verona, Italy","University of Verona","Crosara, M (corresponding author), Univ Verona, Verona, Italy.","marco.crosara@studenti.univr.it; luca.olivieri@univr.it; fausto.spoto@univr.it; fabio.tagliaferro@univr.it","","Olivieri, Luca/0000-0001-8074-8980; Crosara, Marco/0000-0002-2172-7669","FSE - Regione del Veneto [1463/2019]","FSE - Regione del Veneto","Work supported by FSE -Regione del Veneto: DGR N. 1463/2019, Innovazione e ricerca per un Veneto piu competitivo -Assegni di ricerca anno 2019.","","18","1","1","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-2182-9","","","","2021","","","","","","","187","194","","10.1109/BCCA53669.2021.9657047","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BCCA53669.2021.9657047","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7HP","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000848651400025","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We apply the Fractionally Cointegrated Vector Autoregression (FCVAR) model and investigate the risk-return relationship. This has not been studied previously, much less disintegrating the series into periods of pre-crash, post-crash, and the full sample. Empirical results indicate that risk series in all eight cryptocurrency markets exhibit long-memory property, and there is a long-run fractional cointegration relationship between the risk of altcoins and Bitcoin. Most importantly, though a positive risk-return tradeoff is found in the full sample, there are big differences between results of pre-crash and post-crash. The time horizon set to 14 days, all the eight currencies exhibit traditional risk-return tradeoff after the crisis, whereas the effect doesn't exist before the crisis, with the exception of Dash and Doge. In the same vein, there is no leverage effect in all eight currencies before the crisis but this effect is present in three cryptocurrencies after the crisis. The differences indicate that investors are more cautious, increasing risk awareness and demanding higher compensation for risk after the crash. The above results are robust when time horizon is 30 days.","[Tan, Zhengxun] Hunan Normal Univ, Sch Business, 36 Lushan Rd, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Huang, Yilong] Hunan Normal Univ, Sch Business, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Binuo] Xiamen Univ, Sch Business, Xiamen, Peoples R China","Hunan Normal University; Hunan Normal University; Xiamen University","Tan, ZX (corresponding author), Hunan Normal Univ, Sch Business, 36 Lushan Rd, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.","tzxun1810@163.com","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71773035]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The authors were supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant No. 71773035.","","72","10","10","3","23","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0275-5319","1878-3384","","RES INT BUS FINANC","Res.

This has been true since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and it continues along the inventive process in the last 220 years. The innovative technology of blockchains and cryptocurrencies with smart contracts (distributed digital technology) has a potential for substantial reduction of transactions costs that are rooted in human nature. Like earlier transformational innovative technologies, such as the steam locomotive and the internet, the new distributed digital technology may create disruptions in the market today, but if successful it will increase welfare by transforming the way that people transact in the market in the future. The major feature of the new digital technology is that it makes it possible for individuals to match their supply and demand without intervention of organisations like firms, financial intermediaries and regulating agencies. The new digital technology gets us closer to the neoclassical perfect market model. Distributed digital technology progresses in a step-by-step fashion. The first step was the Bitcoin: electronic peer-to-peer cash transfers without the need for central regulations. A number of services, particularly those that can be traded digitally, are next in line. Two potential applications of distributed digital applications are global trade in services and to MNEs.","[Agmon, Tamir] Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Management, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Agmon, Tamir] Gothenburg Univ, Sch Business Econ & Law, Gothenburg, Sweden","Tel Aviv University; University of Gothenburg","Agmon, T (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Management, Tel Aviv, Israel.;Agmon, T (corresponding author), Gothenburg Univ, Sch Business Econ & Law, Gothenburg, Sweden.","tamir.agmon41@gmail.com","","","","","","","22","2","2","3","23","INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD","GENEVA","WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG, 29 ROUTE DE PRE-BOIS, CASE POSTALE 856, CH-1215 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND","1751-6757","1751-6765","","EUR J INT MANAG","Eur.

Tether provides one of the most relevant ways to buy bitcoins and has been the centre of many controversies. In fact, it has been hypothesized that new tethers are issued without the underlying reserves, and that new massive Tether emissions are the basis of strong speculative movements on the Bitcoin, with consequent bubble effects. In the course of this article, we conduct a Social Network Analysis focused on the Tether transaction graph to identify the main actors that play a leading role on the network and characterize the transaction flow between them. From our analysis, we conclude that 1) the Tether transaction network does not enjoy the Smalltalk property, with the robustness and reliability it carries with it; 2) cryptopcurrency exchanges are the nodes with the greatest centrality; 3) even Assortativity is not found, as the subjects who move Tether on a large scale do not give continuity to their presence and operations, therefore do not get a chance to consolidate stable links between them; and 4) among the exchanges, Bitfinex, which has co-ownership and co-administration relationships with the Tether issuer, can be mostly associated with the Rich-gets-Richer property.","[Rosa, Giovanni; Pareschi, Remo] Univ Molise, Stake Lab, Campobasso, Italy","University of Molise","Pareschi, R (corresponding author), Univ Molise, Stake Lab, Campobasso, Italy.","remo.pareschi@unimol.it","","","","","","","31","1","1","4","5","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","2624-7852","","","FRONT BLOCKCHAIN","Front.

The data set comprises daily observations of close prices in the selected markets from 17-04-2018 to 20-06-2021. Using the Yang and Zhao (2020) and Koenker and Xiao (2004) quantile unit-root tests for return persistence, we find heterogeneity in reactions and recovery patterns not only across asset classes, but also within them. Specifically, we find strong potential for mean reversion in equity markets even at high levels of shocks. While gold offers limited mean reversion, platinum shows very strong resistance to the COVID. Government bonds show small declines in value to the COVID in addition to high persistence. Cryptocurrencies, as a group, turn out to be the riskiest in the long-term, with more than a 50% decline in value coupled with high degrees of persistence. Our results raise questions as to the safe haven characteristics of the newly-popular Bitcoin. Our findings are useful for policy makers and investors through a better understanding of differences in the potential for mean reversion provided by different asset classes.","[Yarovaya, Larisa] Southampton Business Sch, Ctr Digital Finance, Southampton, Hants, England; [Matkovskyy, Roman; Jalan, Akanksha] Rennes Sch Business, Dept Finance & Accounting, Rennes, France","Solent University","Yarovaya, L (corresponding author), Southampton Business Sch, Ctr Digital Finance, Southampton, Hants, England.","l.yarovaya@soton.ac.uk; roman.matkovskyy@rennes-sb.com; akanksha.jalan@rennes-sb.com","Matkovskyy, Roman/AAM-5508-2020","Matkovskyy, Roman/0000-0001-6270-7202; Yarovaya, Larisa/0000-0002-9638-2917","","","","","86","10","10","5","12","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0275-5319","1878-3384","","RES INT BUS FINANC","Res.

DIX systems building on alternative consensus mechanisms, particularly proof-of-stake (PoS), aim to address this downside. In this paper, we take an initial step towards comparing the energy requirements of such systems to understand whether they achieve this goal equally well. While multiple studies have analysed the energy demands of individual blockchains, little comparative work has been done. We approach this research gap by formalising a basic consumption model for PoS blockchains. Applying this model to six archetypal blockchains generates three main findings. First, we confirm the concerns around the energy footprint of PoW by showing that Bitcoin's energy consumption exceeds the energy consumption of all PoS-based systems analysed by at least three orders of magnitude. Second, we illustrate that there are significant differences in energy consumption among the PoS-based systems analysed, with permissionless systems having a larger energy footprint overall owing to their higher replication factor. Third, we point out that the type of hardware that validators use has a considerable impact on whether the energy consumption of PoS blockchains is comparable with or considerably larger than that of centralised systems.","[Platt, Moritz] Kings Coll London, Dept Informat, London, England; [Sedlmeir, Johannes] Univ Bayreuth, FIM Res Ctr, Bayreuth, Germany; [Platt, Daniel] Imperial Coll London, Dept Math, London, England; [Xu, Jiahua; Tasca, Paolo; Vadgama, Nikhil; Ibanez, Juan Ignacio] UCL, Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England","University of London; King's College London; University of Bayreuth; Imperial College London; University of London; University College London","Platt, M (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Dept Informat, London, England.","moritz.platt@kcl.ac.uk; johannes.sedlmeir@fim-rc.de; daniel.platt.17@ucl.ac.uk; jiahua.xu@ucl.ac.uk; p.tasca@ucl.ac.uk; nikhil.vadgama@ucl.ac.uk; j.ibanez@ucl.ac.uk","Xu, Jiahua/P-7591-2019","Xu, Jiahua/0000-0002-3993-5263; Platt, Moritz/0000-0003-2137-4370","Google Cloud via the Google Cloud Research Grant programme; UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L015234/1]; EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Geometry and Number Theory (The London School of Geometry and Number Theory); University College London; Imperial College London","Google Cloud via the Google Cloud Research Grant programme; UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Geometry and Number Theory (The London School of Geometry and Number Theory)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); University College London(General Electric); Imperial College London(General Electric)","We thank Michel Zade for comments that greatly improved the manuscript.

Its potential has gained significant interest in various applications, varying from the music industry, financial services, Internet-of-Things (IoT), smart grid, edge computing, cybersecurity, and the healthcare industry. However, the information is divided amongst several intermediaries involved with adverse impacts on data quality in the healthcare domain. In the near future, blockchain technology can reshape the way the healthcare industry works by providing personalized and reliable patient data management, reforming the traditional healthcare practices, secure mechanisms for data sharing, efficient pharmaceutical supply chain management, and drug traceability and many more. In this study, an extensive literature review has been provided that includes the different prospects of using blockchain technology in healthcare. The review investigates the work done to enable the amalgamation of IoT and Blockchain in the health ecosystem. Significant blockchain-based healthcare use cases such as data storage, data sharing, drug traceability, clinical trials, and remote patient monitoring are investigated. Further, the Internet of Things and blockchain technology-based SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat) analysis and the challenges linked in the healthcare domain because of the enactment of IoT and blockchain technology are discussed to support advanced studies in this domain.","[Sharma, Aashima; Kaur, Sanmeet; Singh, Maninder] Thapar Inst Engn & Technol, Comp Sci & Engn Dept, Patiala 147004, Punjab, India","Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology","Sharma, A (corresponding author), Thapar Inst Engn & Technol, Comp Sci & Engn Dept, Patiala 147004, Punjab, India.","asharma_phd17@thapar.edu","Singh, Maninder/B-7553-2009","Singh, Maninder/0000-0001-8489-8759","","","","","263","6","6","13","51","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2161-3915","","","T EMERG TELECOMMUN T","Trans.

In the bitcoin-like blockchain systems, the transactions are finished via the cryptography scripts. The user's public key hash code and address information are recorded in a locking script, and posted on the blockchain for verification. By analyzing all transaction records of an address, we can obtain the transaction behaviors of the address, including transaction frequency, number of transactions, and typical address for long-term usage. Sometimes, user privacy will be impacted according to the above analysis. To solve the problem, this paper proposes an anonymous hidden transaction model of the blockchain systems through modifying the original blockchain transaction script. In the proposed multi-layer model, the blockchain transaction system is divided into three layers. For top to bottom, they are shell account (under the public address) layer, hidden account (under the private address) layer and the user layer respectively. The hidden accounts can map to different shell account to complete the transactions. We combine the zero-knowledge proof mechanism so that the finished transaction can be verified by any user. The theoretical analysis shows that our proposed method can effectively protect transaction user information and realize truly anonymous transactions.","[Zhang, Jingyu; Zhou, Guoyao; Wang, Jin; Huang, Lisha] Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp & Commun Engn, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jingyu] Natl Univ Def Technol, Sch Syst Engn, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jin] Fujian Univ Technol, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China","Changsha University of Science & Technology; National University of Defense Technology - China; Fujian University of Technology","Zhang, JY (corresponding author), Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp & Commun Engn, Changsha, Peoples R China.;Zhang, JY (corresponding author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Sch Syst Engn, Changsha, Peoples R China.","zhangzhang@csust.edu.cn","Zhang, Jing/GWZ-7332-2022; wang, jing/GVT-8700-2022; WANG, JINGYI/GSJ-1241-2022; Wang, Jin/GYA-2019-2022","","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [RSP-2020/102]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61802031, 61772454, 61811530332, 61811540410]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China [2019JGYB177]; Research Foundation of Education Bureau of Hunan Province, China [18C0216]; Practical Innovation and Entrepreneurial Ability Improvement Plan for Professional Degree Graduate students of Changsha University of Science and Technology [SJCX201971]; Hunan Graduate Scientific Research Innovation Project, China [CX2019694]; Programs of Transformation and Upgrading of Industries and Information Technologies of Jiangsu Province [JITC-1900AX2038/01]","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); Research Foundation of Education Bureau of Hunan Province, China; Practical Innovation and Entrepreneurial Ability Improvement Plan for Professional Degree Graduate students of Changsha University of Science and Technology; Hunan Graduate Scientific Research Innovation Project, China; Programs of Transformation and Upgrading of Industries and Information Technologies of Jiangsu Province","We thank Researchers Supporting Project (No. RSP-2020/102) King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for funding this research.

In this paper, we present an accessible, low-cost attack in which the attacker paralyzes multiple payment network channels for several days. The attack is based on overloading channels with requests that are kept unresolved until their expiration time. Reaching the maximum allowed unresolved requests (HTLCs) locks the channel for new payments. The attack is in fact inherent to the way off-chain networks are constructed, since limits on the number of unresolved payments are derived from limits on the blockchain. We consider three versions of the attack: one in which the attacker attempts to block as many high liquidity channels as possible, one in which it disconnects as many pairs of nodes as it can, and one in which it tries to isolate individual nodes from the network. We evaluate the costs of these attacks on Bitcoin's Lightning Network and compare how changes in the network have affected the cost of attack. Specifically, we consider how recent changes to default parameters in each of the main Lightning implementations contribute to the attacks. Finally, we suggest mitigation techniques that make these attacks much harder to carry out.","[Mizrahi, Ayelet; Zohar, Aviv] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel","Hebrew University of Jerusalem","Mizrahi, A (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.","ayelem02@cs.huji.ac.il; avivz@cs.huji.ac.il","","Zohar, Aviv/0000-0001-8539-9222; Lotem (Mizrahi), Ayelet/0000-0003-4037-1028","Israel Science Foundation [1504/17]; HUJI Cyber Security Research Center; Israel National Cyber Bureau","Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); HUJI Cyber Security Research Center; Israel National Cyber Bureau","This research was supported by the Israel Science Foundation (grant 1504/17) and by a grant from the HUJI Cyber Security Research Center in conjunction with the Israel National Cyber Bureau.","","37","3","3","0","2","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-662-64331-0; 978-3-662-64330-3","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2021","12675","","","","","","170","188","","10.1007/978-3-662-64331-0_9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-64331-0_9","","","19","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS3JS","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000712016200009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Here, we elaborate a highly integrative, community-based strategy where a token-based crypto-economy supports finding best possible consensus, trust, and truth by adding unconventional elements known from reputation systems, betting, secondary markets, and social networking. These tokens support the holder's formalized reputation and are used in liquid-democracy style governance and arbitration within projects or community-driven initiatives. This participatory research model serves as a solid basis for comprehensively leveraging collective intelligence by effectively incentivizing contributions from the crowd, such as intellectual property work, validation, assessment, infrastructure, education, assessment, governance, publication, and promotion of projects. On the analogy of its current blockbusters like peer-to-peer structured decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain technology can seminally enhance the efficiency of science and RTD initiatives, even permitting to fully stage operations as a chiefless decentralized autonomous organization (DAOs).","[Ducree, Jens] Dublin City Univ, Sch Phys Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Etzrodt, Martin] Akasha Fdn, Zug, Switzerland; [Bartling, Soenke] Blockchain Sci GmbH, Berlin, Germany; [Walshe, Ray] Dublin City Univ, Sch Comp, Dublin, Ireland; [Harrington, Tomas] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, Fac Social Sci, Innovat Technol & Operat Management Grp, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Wittek, Neslihan] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fac Psychol, Dept Biopsychol, Bochum, Germany; [Posth, Sebastian] Posth Werk BV, Leiden, Netherlands; [Wittek, Kevin] Westphalian Univ Appl Sci, Inst Internet Secur, Gelsenkirchen, Germany; [Ionita, Andrei; Prinz, Wolfgang] Fraunhofer Inst Appl Informat Technol FIT, St Augustin, Germany; [Prinz, Wolfgang] Fac Elect Engn & Informat Technol, Aachen, Germany; [Kogias, Dimitrios] Univ West Attica, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Egaleo, Greece; [Paixao, Tiago] Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, Rua Quinta Grande 6, Oeiras, Portugal; [Peterfi, Iosif; Lawton, James] Max Planck Gesell, Max Planck Digital Lib MPDL, Munich, Germany","Dublin City University; Dublin City University; University of East Anglia; Ruhr University Bochum; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; University of West Attica; Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia; Max Planck Society","Ducree, J (corresponding author), Dublin City Univ, Sch Phys Sci, Dublin, Ireland.","jens.ducree@dcu.ie","","","","","","","110","2","2","2","13","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","2624-7852","","","FRONT BLOCKCHAIN","Front.

The Litecoin mining process uses the Scrypt algorithm as a hash function in Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. The yield of cryptocurrency mining depends a lot on the processing performance of the hardware. Therefore, this paper proposes a hardware design of the Scrypt algorithm in the Litecoin mining system using the Verilog hardware description language (HDL). In the proposed design, the pipeline technique is applied at two levels: the overall Scrypt level and the PBKDF2 level. Additionally, the design is divided into several stages to reduce the latency of each clock cycle and increase the operating frequency. The simulation and verification of the design are performed based on Atlys Spartan-6 FPGA Board and Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA VC707. The performance of the design evaluated on Atlys Spartan-6 has the hash rate of 2209 hashes/s. The maximum operating frequency of the system is 147.059MHz.

Using exploratory factor analysis, six distinct research streams are identified: I. energy market innovation and transformation (through blockchain technology), II. blockchain for data sharing and security, III. energy management in smart grids and scalable systems, IV. information transmission across networks and its applications, V. peer-to-peer energy microgrids, and VI. potential of blockchain technology. For each of these streams, the highest-impact articles are reviewed. In addition, social network analysis allows to reveal the relationships and dependencies between the streams. The results indicate a high degree of homogeneity in this field of research, as the six streams explain more than 71% of variance. The degree to which the streams are centered on blockchain technology varies. While the two most established discourses and the least established one focus at least in part on blockchain, the other three streams prioritize energy issues.

Personal comprehensive credit score as a measure to promote social governance is closely related to personal privacy. Although there are currently credit score calculation systems for various application scenarios, these systems almost ignore user privacy protection, which leads to user information leakage or abuse. The combination of zero-knowledge proof and personal credit score calculation has been studied by a number of researchers at the present stage. However, all data are provided by users directly in the current schemes, which did not consider the data authenticity under the situation that users provided false data. In this paper, we utilize zero-knowledge proof to design a novel privacy protection scheme for personal credit score calculation, taking into account the authenticity verification of multi-dimensional user data. In addition, our scheme also proposes the concept of a universal verification platform based on blockchain for personal credit scores. This platform has more substantial applicability and versatility for any qualified institution that requires querying and verifying user's credit scores. At the end of the paper, we conducted a security analysis and performance evaluation for the overall scheme.","[Han, Yuye; Chen, Hong; Qiu, Zhijie; Luo, Lei] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch SCSE, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Qian, Gongbin] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Shenzhen University","Han, YY (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch SCSE, Chengdu, Peoples R China.","hanyuye@ldblock.com; chenhong8010@uestc.edu.cn; qzhijie@uestc.edu.cn; lluo@uestc.edu.cn; qiangb@szu.edu.cn","","","Foundation of Guangdong Key Areas of Service for Rural Revitalization Plan [2019KZDZX2014, 2020ZDZX1037]","Foundation of Guangdong Key Areas of Service for Rural Revitalization Plan","This work is supported in part by the Foundation of Guangdong Key Areas of Service for Rural Revitalization Plan under Grant 2019KZDZX2014, 2020ZDZX1037.","","20","1","1","5","5","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2639-1589","","978-1-6654-3902-2","IEEE INT CONF BIG DA","","","2021","","","","","","","3629","3636","","10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671494","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671494","","","8","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT1RU","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000800559503100","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A blockchain system implements a tamper-evident ledger for recording transactions that modify some global states. The system captures the entire evolution history of the states. The management of that history, also known as data provenance or lineage, has been studied extensively in database systems. However, querying data history in existing blockchains can only be done by replaying all transactions. This approach is applicable to large-scale, offline analysis, but is not suitable for online transaction processing. In this paper, we identify a new class of blockchain applications whose execution logics depend on provenance information at runtime. We first motivate the need for adding native provenance support to blockchains. We then present LineageChain, a fine-grained, secure and efficient provenance system for blockchains. LineageChain exposes lineage information to smart contracts runtime via simple and elegant interfaces that efficiently and securely support provenance-dependent contracts. LineageChain captures provenance during contract execution and stores it in a Merkle tree. LineageChain provides a novel skip list index designed for efficient provenance queries. We have implemented LineageChain on top of Fabric and a blockchain optimized storage system called ForkBase. Our extensive evaluation of LineageChain demonstrates its benefits to the new class of blockchain applications, its high query performance and its small storage overhead.","[Ruan, Pingcheng; Lin, Qian; Ooi, Beng Chin] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Tien Tuan Anh Dinh] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Singapore, Singapore; [Zhang, Meihui] Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Gang] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Peoples R China","National University of Singapore; Singapore University of Technology & Design; Beijing Institute of Technology; Zhejiang University","Ruan, PC (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.","ruanpc@comp.nus.edu.sg; dinhtta@sutd.edu.sg; linqian@comp.nus.edu.sg; meihui_zhang@bit.edu.cn; cg@zju.edu.cn; ooibc@comp.nus.edu.sg","Dinh, Tien Tuan Anh/AAB-1363-2022","Dinh, Tien Tuan Anh/0000-0002-8158-3636","Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 3 under MOE's official grant [MOE2017-T3-1-007]","Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 3 under MOE's official grant(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","This research is supported by Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 3 under MOE's official grant number MOE2017-T3-1-007.","","53","4","4","11","18","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1066-8888","0949-877X","","VLDB J","VLDB J.","JAN","2021","30","1","","","SI","","3","24","","10.1007/s00778-020-00646-1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00778-020-00646-1","","FEB 2021","22","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science","QQ5GN","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000615765100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Web archives store born-digital documents, which are usually collected from the Internet by crawlers and stored in the Web Archive (WARC) format. The trustworthiness and integrity of web archives is still an open challenge, especially in the news portal domain, which face additional challenges of censorship even in democratic societies. Aim. The aim of this paper is to present a light-weight, blockchainbased solution for web archive validation, which would ensure that the crawled documents are authentic for many years to come. Method. We developed our archive validation solution as an extension and continuation of our work in web crawler development, mainly targeting news portals. The system is designed as an overlay over a blockchain with a proof-of-stake (PoS) distributed consensus algorithm. PoS was chosen due to its lower ecological footprint compared to proofof-work solutions (e.g. Bitcoin) and lower expected investment in computing infrastructure. Results. We implemented a prototype of the proposed solution in Python and C#. The prototype was tested on web archive content crawled from Hungarian news portals at two different timestamps which consisted of 1 million articles in total. Conclusions. We concluded that the proposed solution is accessible, usable by different stakeholders to validate crawled content, deployable on cheap commodity hardware, tackles the archive integrity challenge and is capable to efficiently manage duplicate documents.","[Lendak, Imre] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Informat, Budapest, Hungary; [Indig, Balazs; Palko, Gabor] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Humanities, Ctr Digital Humanities, Budapest, Hungary; [Lendak, Imre] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Novi Sad, Serbia","Eotvos Lorand University; Eotvos Lorand University; University of Novi Sad","Lendak, I (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Informat, Budapest, Hungary.;Lendak, I (corresponding author), Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Novi Sad, Serbia.","lendak@inf.elte.hu","","Palko, Gabor/0000-0002-4394-8577; Indig, Balazs/0000-0001-8090-3661; Lendak, Imre/0000-0001-6188-4936","Institutional Excellence Program for Higher Education (FIKP) of the Republic of Hungary","Institutional Excellence Program for Higher Education (FIKP) of the Republic of Hungary","This research was supported by the Institutional Excellence Program for Higher Education (FIKP) of the Republic of Hungary.","","20","0","0","1","1","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-79318-0; 978-3-030-79317-3","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2021","12812","","","","","","121","134","","10.1007/978-3-030-79318-0_7","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-79318-0_7","","","14","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; History & Philosophy Of Science; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Computer Science; History & Philosophy of Science; Social Sciences - Other Topics","BT0NZ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000790334400007","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This work elaborates upon the Iranian Internet blackout by characterizing the event through Internet-scale, near real-time network traffic measurements. Beginning with an investigation of compromised machines scanning the Internet, nearly 50 TB of network traffic data was analyzed. This work discovers 856,625 compromised IP addresses, with 17,182 attributed to the Iranian Internet space. By the second day of the Internet shut down, these numbers dropped by 18.46% and 92.81%, respectively. Empirical analysis of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm revealed that over 90% of compromised Iranian hosts were fingerprinted as IoT devices, which saw a significant drop throughout the shutdown (96.17% decrease by the blackout's second day). Further examination correlates BGP reachability metrics and related data with geolocation databases to statistically evaluate the number of reachable Iranian ASNs (dropping from approximately 1100 to under 200 reachable networks). In-depth investigation reveals the top affected ASNs, providing network forensic evidence of the longitudinal unplugging of such key networks. Lastly, the impact's interruption of the Bitcoin cryptomining market is highlighted, disclosing a massive spike in unsuccessful (i.e., pending) transactions. When combined, these network traffic measurements provide a multidimensional perspective of the Iranian Internet shutdown.","[Mangino, Antonio; Bou-Harb, Elias] Univ Texas San Antonio, Cyber Ctr Secur & Analyt, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA","University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA)","Mangino, A (corresponding author), Univ Texas San Antonio, Cyber Ctr Secur & Analyt, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.","antonio.mangino@utsa.edu; elias.bouharb@utsa.edu","","","","","","","18","1","1","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2376-6492","","978-1-7281-8616-0","INT WIREL COMMUN","","","2021","","","","","","","813","818","","10.1109/IWCMC51323.2021.9498743","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC51323.2021.9498743","","","6","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BS2VJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000707024100148","View Full Record in Web of Science"

With the rise of Blockchain-based systems, identities are becoming even more critical than before, mainly due to the immutability property. In fact, many publicly accessible Blockchain networks like Ethereum rely on pseudonymization as a method for identifying subject actions. Pseudonyms are often employed to maintain anonymity, but true anonymity requires unlinkability. Without this property, any attacker can examine the messages sent by a specific pseudonym and learn new information about the holder of this pseudonym. This use of Blockchain collides with regulations because of the right to be forgotten, and Blockchain-based solutions are ensuring that every data stored within the chain will not be modified. In this paper we define a method and a tool for dealing with digital identities within Blockchain environments that are compliant with regulations. The proposed method provides a way to grant digital pseudo identities unlinked to the real identity. This new method uses the benefits of key derivation systems to ensure a non-binding interaction between users and the information model associated with their identity. The proposed method is demonstated in the Ethereum context and illustrated with a case study.","[Gutierrez-Aguero, Ivan; Anguita, Sergio; Larrucea, Xabier; Gomez-Goiri, Aitor; Urquizu, Borja] Tecnalia Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Derio 48170, Spain","","Larrucea, X (corresponding author), Tecnalia Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Derio 48170, Spain.","xabier.larrucea@tecnalia.com","; Gomez-Goiri, Aitor/C-3012-2012","Urkizu, Borja/0000-0002-9751-757X; Anguita Lorenzo, Sergio/0000-0001-5517-7645; Gutierrez, Ivan/0000-0002-3037-229X; Larrucea, Xabier/0000-0002-6402-922X; Gomez-Goiri, Aitor/0000-0002-5576-0379","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program PoSeID-on (Protection and control of Secured Information by means of a privacy enhanced Dashboard) [786713]","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program PoSeID-on (Protection and control of Secured Information by means of a privacy enhanced Dashboard)","This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program PoSeID-on (Protection and control of Secured Information by means of a privacy enhanced Dashboard) under Grant 786713.","","50","0","0","5","13","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2021","9","","","","","","108912","108923","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3101302","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3101302","","","12","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","TY7RP","","Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000683978300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The characteristics of blockchain such as immutability and openness, however, have made DApps more vulnerable to various security risks, and thus it has become of great significance to validate the integrity of DApps before they actually operate upon blockchain. Recently, research on vulnerability in smart contracts (a building block of DApps) has been actively conducted, and various vulnerabilities and their countermeasures were reported. However, the effectiveness of such countermeasures has not been studied well, and no appropriate methods have been proposed to evaluate them. In this paper, we propose a software tool that can easily perform comparative studies by adding existing/new countermeasures and labeled smart contract codes. The proposed tool demonstrates verification performance using various statistical indicators, which helps to identify the most effective countermeasures for each type of vulnerability. Using the proposed tool, we evaluated state-of-the-art countermeasures with 237 labeled benchmark codes. The results indicate that for certain types of vulnerabilities, some countermeasures show evenly good performance scores on various metrics. However, it is also observed that countermeasures that detect the largest number of vulnerable codes typically generate much more false positives, resulting in very low precision and accuracy. Consequently, under given constraints, different countermeasures may be recommended for detecting vulnerabilities of interest. We believe that the proposed tool could effectively be utilized for a future verification study of smart contract applications and contribute to the development of practical and secure smart contract applications.","[Ji, Suhwan; Kim, Dohyung; Im, Hyeonseung] Kangwon Natl Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Program Med Bigdata Conver, Chunchon 24341, South Korea; [Kim, Dohyung; Im, Hyeonseung] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Chunchon 24341, South Korea","Kangwon National University; Kangwon National University","Kim, D; Im, H (corresponding author), Kangwon Natl Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Program Med Bigdata Conver, Chunchon 24341, South Korea.;Kim, D; Im, H (corresponding author), Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Chunchon 24341, South Korea.","d.kim@kangwon.ac.kr; hsim@kangwon.ac.kr","","Im, Hyeonseung/0000-0002-3901-0834; Ji, Suhwan/0000-0001-8934-6099; Kim, Dohyung/0000-0002-6364-1505","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean Government (MSIT) [2019R1F1A1063272, 2020R1F1A1048395, 2020R1A4A3079947]","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean Government (MSIT)","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Korean Government (MSIT) under Grant 2019R1F1A1063272, Grant 2020R1F1A1048395, and Grant 2020R1A4A3079947.","","32","1","1","3","4","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2021","9","","","","","","90029","90042","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3091317","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3091317","","","14","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","TJ8QB","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000673738000001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

But even with the advancement in standing from conceptual beginnings to real-world experimentation, mainstream adoption of the technologies in either organizational or individual contexts has yet to eventuate. To resolve this paradox, we examine progression of the technologies' diffusion instead, and in the process, seek to uncover the underlying dynamics of sentiments at play. Diffusion involves multiple actions by different parties, with social discourses via diverse media playing an essential role. In demonstrating the interplay of support to resistance via media framing and the diffusion of innovation theory, findings from our paper contribute to the technology adoption literature. Understanding resistant behavior toward a new technology area could help resolve potential issues that may arise. This would hopefully lead to better technological implementation outcomes in future.","[Perdana, Arif] Singapore Inst Technol, Singapore, Singapore; [Lee, W.

Blockchain has numerous benefits, such as decentralisation, immutability and tamper-proofing. Blockchain is composed of two processes, namely, mining (the process of adding a new block or transaction to the global public ledger created by the previous block) and validation (the process of validating the new block added). Several consensus protocols have been introduced to validate blockchain transactions, Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which are crucial to cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. However, these consensus protocols are vulnerable to double-spending attacks. Amongst these attacks, the 51% attack is the most prominent because it involves forking a blockchain to conduct double spending. Many attempts have been made to solve this issue, and examples include delayed proof-of-work (PoW) and several Byzantine fault tolerance mechanisms. These attempts, however, suffer from delay issues and unsorted block sequences. This study proposes a hybrid algorithm that combines PoS and PoW mechanisms to provide a fair mining reward to the miner/validator by conducting forking to combine PoW and PoS consensuses. As demonstrated by the experimental results, the proposed algorithm can reduce the possibility of intruders performing double mining because it requires achieving 100% dominance in the network, which is impossible.","[Akbar, Nur Arifin] Res Dept, Idenit Mashable Prototyping, Banyumas 53124, Indonesia; [Muneer, Amgad] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Seri Iskandar 32160, Malaysia; [ElHakim, Narmine; Fati, Suliman Mohamed] Prince Sultan Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Riyadh 11586, Saudi Arabia","Universiti Teknologi Petronas; Prince Sultan University","Fati, SM (corresponding author), Prince Sultan Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Riyadh 11586, Saudi Arabia.","arifin@idenitive.pro; muneeramgad@gmail.com","Fati, Suliman/AFS-4136-2022; Muneer, Amgad/AAT-8412-2020; Fati, Suliman Mohamed/W-9547-2018","Fati, Suliman/0000-0002-6969-2338; Muneer, Amgad/0000-0002-7157-3020; Akbar, Nur Arifin/0000-0002-3305-2187; ElHakim, Narmine/0000-0003-2101-2687","Prince Sultan University","Prince Sultan University","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of Prince Sultan University for paying the article processing charges (APC) of this publication.","","57","10","10","9","14","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1999-5903","","FUTURE INTERNET","Future Internet","NOV","2021","13","11","","","","","","","285","10.3390/fi13110285","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi13110285","","","20","Computer Science, Information Systems","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Computer Science","XH0VG","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000725160500001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

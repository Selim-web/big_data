The proposed algorithm aims to classify the cold wallets, hot wallets and user wallets in the Bitcoin exchanges, which are verified by off-chain information from the Internet. By analyzing the structures of different Bitcoin exchanges, we find that most Bitcoin exchanges exist weakness in managing the reasonable amounts of bitcoins kept in hot wallets. A large amount of Bitcoins stored in hot wallets can meet the users' withdrawal demands but may increase the risk of attack. However, a small amount of bitcoins in hot wallet may be inconvenient to frequently transfer for cold wallet. The problem then is modeled as a Bitcoin withdrawal prediction problem for hot wallets. We adopt traditional and classific supervised learning methods to solve the problems. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach provides reasonable prediction results. Furthermore, we simulate two processes to analyze our results. The first process shows that Facebook-prophet outperforms other methods if there is no transaction occurred from cold wallets to hot wallet. The second process shows that the more transactions from cold wallets to hot wallets, the smaller Bitcoins required for hot wallets. Overall, our work is valuable and useful for the Bitcoin exchanges' business.","[Li, Yang; Liu, Zilu; Zheng, Zibin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Li, Yang; Liu, Zilu; Zheng, Zibin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Digital Life, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University","Li, Y (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.;Li, Y (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Digital Life, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.","liyang99@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; liuzl9@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; zhzibin@mail.sysu.edu.cn","Zheng, Zibin/E-3024-2014; Zheng, Zibin/HCH-2408-2022","Zheng, Zibin/0000-0002-7878-4330; Zheng, Zibin/0000-0002-7878-4330; Li, Yang/0000-0001-5653-1829","National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFB1000101]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1811461, 61722214]; Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme","National Key Research and Development Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme","The work described in this paper was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program (2016YFB1000101), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1811461, 61722214) and the Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme (2016).","","15","0","0","2","20","SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD","SINGAPORE","152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE","1865-0929","1865-0937","978-981-15-2777-7; 978-981-15-2776-0","COMM COM INF SC","","","2020","1156","","","","","","549","562","","10.1007/978-981-15-2777-7_44","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-2777-7_44","","","14","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR5RE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000656861800044","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Therefore, it is of paramount importance to the consumers and industry to maintain reliable access to their Bitcoin assets. In this paper, we investigate the resilience of Bitcoin to blocking by the powerful network entities such as ISPs and governments. By characterizing Bitcoin's communication patterns, we design classifiers that can distinguish (and therefore block) Bitcoin traffic even if it is tunneled through an encrypted channel like Tor and even if Bitcoin traffic is being mixed with background traffic, e.g., due to browsing websites. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the reliability of our classifiers in identifying Bitcoin traffic even despite using obfuscation protocols like Tor Pluggable Ttransports. We conclude that standard obfuscation mechanisms are not enough to ensure blocking-resilient access to Bitcoin (and similar cryptocurrencies), therefore cryptocurrency operators should deploy tailored traffic obfuscation mechanisms.","[Rezaei, Fatemeh; Naseri, Shahrzad; Houmansadr, Amir] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Eyal, Ittay] Technion, Haifa, Israel","University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst","Rezaei, F (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.","frezaei@cs.umass.edu; shnaseri@cs.umass.edu; ittay@technion.ac.il; amir@cs.umass.edu","","","NSF CAREER [CNS1553301]; BSF","NSF CAREER(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); BSF(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation)","The work was supported by the NSF CAREER grant CNS1553301 and BSF.","","45","0","0","1","2","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","1867-8211","1867-822X","978-3-030-63086-7; 978-3-030-63085-0","L N INST COMP SCI SO","","","2020","335","","","","","","152","171","","10.1007/978-3-030-63086-7_10","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63086-7_10","","","20","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BS8AQ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000769661600010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

As a consequence, they are also rewarded with newly-created bitcoins and transaction fees. However, there are very limited studies to fully understand the characteristics and behaviors of bitcoin miners. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive measurement study to shed insights into the community of bitcoin miners. By analyzing over ten-year bitcoin transaction logs, we observe that the scale of bitcoin miners shrinks significantly in recent years, and a small fraction of miners received most of newly generated bitcoins. In the early stage of the Bitcoin ecosystem, the mining reward was evenly distributed among miners, but later became more concentrated to a few highly active miners. For most of miners, their active duration is less than one year, and the interval between consecutive mining actions is more than 100 days. By further examining the transaction flows, we find that a significant portion of bitcoins have been hoarded for over 5 years, and the hoarding phenomenon becomes intense in recent years. We also discuss the implications of our findings, and believe our measurements enable us to have a better understanding of the whole Bitcoin ecosystem.","[Xu, Jieyu; Bai, Wen; Hu, Miao; Tian, Haibo; Wu, Di] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Mega Educ Ctr, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jieyu; Bai, Wen; Hu, Miao; Tian, Haibo; Wu, Di] Guangdong Key Lab Big Data Anal & Proc, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Tian, Haibo] GuangDong Prov Key Lab Informat Secur Technol, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China","Sun Yat Sen University","Wu, D (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Mega Educ Ctr, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.;Wu, D (corresponding author), Guangdong Key Lab Big Data Anal & Proc, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.","xujy56@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; baiw6@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; humiao@outlook.com; tianhb@mail.sysu.edu.cn; wudi27@mail.sysu.edu.cn","","","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC0830502]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1911201, 61802452, 62072486]; Guangdong Special Support Program [2017TX04X148]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China [2018A0303130133]; project PCL Future Greater-Bay Area Network Facilities for Large-scale Experiments and Applications [LZC0019]","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Special Support Program; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); project PCL Future Greater-Bay Area Network Facilities for Large-scale Experiments and Applications","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC0830502), the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant U1911201, 61802452, 62072486, Guangdong Special Support Program under Grant 2017TX04X148, the project PCL Future Greater-Bay Area Network Facilities for Large-scale Experiments and Applications (LZC0019), Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China (2018A0303130133).","","33","1","1","1","32","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1936-6442","1936-6450","","PEER PEER NETW APPL","Peer Peer Netw.

Media attention has contributed to the mass of bitcoin trading, and it is possible to perceive similarities with tulip mania, a phenomenon marking Dutch economy in 16th century. Authors analyze technical trading indicators in order to determine whether they are really a market bubble or it can be considered as a good investment opportunity. Authors find that bitcoin is an example of market bubble whose value will drop significantly, regardless of current fluctuation.","","","","","","","University of Rijeka [uniri-drustv-18-255-1424]","University of Rijeka","The publication of this paper has been supported by University of Rijeka under the project Pametni gradovi u funkciji razvoja nacionalnog gospodarstva (uniri-drustv-18-255-1424)","","15","0","0","0","3","UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS & BUSINESS","RIJEKA","IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, CROATIA","","","978-953-7813-56-7","","","","2020","","","","","","","303","315","","","","","","13","Urban Studies","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Urban Studies","BQ4GE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000589579700018","View Full Record in Web of Science"

For this purpose, we propose a methodology based on exponential smoothing to model the dynamics of the Bitcoin network energy efficiency. We consider either directly the hashrate or the bitcoin cost-of-production model (CPM) as a proxy for the hashrate, to take any nonlinearity into account. In the first examined subsample (01/08/2016-04/12/2017), the hashrate and the CPMs were never significant, while a significant cointegration relationship was found in the second subsample (11/12/2017-24/02/2020). The empirical evidence shows that it is better to consider the hashrate directly rather than its proxy represented by the CPM when modeling its relationship with the bitcoin price. Moreover, the causality is always unidirectional going from the bitcoin price to the hashrate (or its proxies), with lags ranging from one week up to six weeks later. These findings are consistent with a large literature in energy economics, which showed that oil and gas returns affect the purchase of the drilling rigs with a delay of up to three months, whereas the impact of changes in the rig count on oil and gas returns is limited or not significant.","[Fantazzini, Dean] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Moscow Sch Econ, Leninskie Gory,1,Bldg 61, Moscow 119992, Russia; [Kolodin, Nikita] Higher Sch Econ, Moscow 109028, Russia","Lomonosov Moscow State University; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics)","Fantazzini, D (corresponding author), Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Moscow Sch Econ, Leninskie Gory,1,Bldg 61, Moscow 119992, Russia.","fantazzini@mse-msu.ru; nakolodin@edu.hse.ru","","Fantazzini, Dean/0000-0002-1481-3382"," [20-68-47030]; Russian Science Foundation [20-68-47030] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation","; Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF))","This research was funded by Dean Fantazzini grant number 20-68-47030.","","50","7","8","1","12","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

One of Bitcoin vulnerabilities is caused by ECDSA weak randomness. A random number is not cryptographically secure, which leads to private key leakage and even fund theft. This security problem has been well known in Bitcoin community and fixed by applying RFC 6979 update in 2013. In this paper, we systematically revisit the cases where random numbers are reused and evaluate them based on practical Bitcoin transactions. After analyzing Bitcoin transaction dataset from January 2009 to July 2017, we find that there are still approximately 0.48 percent of transactions involving this vulnerability, and 1331 private keys have been compromised. In addition, the transactions related to some involved addresses have a common pattern, which gives us a clue that a spam transaction attack may take advantage of ECDSA weak randomness. We also examine mainstream Bitcoin software wallets to check whether they are susceptible to ECDSA weak randomness. Even the result is quite optimistic, an example that one of the influenced addresses leaked in April 2014 is still in use again in August 2017 reflects that the severity of ECDSA weak randomness may not be paid enough attention even after its discovery and solution in 2013.

This article is an attempt to reveal the effects of policy uncertainty on Bitcoin returns with economic policy uncertainty (EPU) in the US, the UK, Japan, China, and Hong Kong. Furthermore, we also present the results of monetary policy uncertainty (MPU) on the Bitcoin market. The robust estimations from the quantile regression and Markov regime-switching model show that Bitcoin returns are affected by EPU. One of the essential findings is that Bitcoin returns are more responsive to EPU in the US, China, and Japan. In the US and Japan, uncertainty has a negative effect on the Bitcoin market whereas in China it has a positive effect. Global MPU uncertainty is also significant in explaining Bitcoin exchange rates. Moreover, the Bitcoin market is negatively affected by uncertainty in Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the gross domestic product, and other macroeconomic data.

By using different models and data sources for Bitcoin, we find that GP predicts future Bitcoin return. When the price of gold relative to platinum increases, Bitcoin return also goes up. This finding is consistent with previous studies and contributes to the ongoing discussion whether GP can be used as an indicator for aggregate market risk. Using variance decomposition, we also find that volatility in the gold and platinum market can influence Bitcoin volatility and that this relationship shows time-varying dependency. Finally, our results are robust to including new year effects and data of different frequency. Hence, this paper contributes to the current literature of Bitcoin by showing that GP provides an important proxy of risk in the economy. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Using the error correction model, the relationship between the price of the virtual currency, Bitcoin, and the number of Google searches that used the terms bitcoin, bitcoin crash and crisis between December 2012 and February 2018 is analyzed. The study also applied the same analysis to prices of Bitcoin denominated in different sovereign currencies traded during the same period. The Johansen (J Econ Dyn Control 12:231-254, 1988) test demonstrates that the price and number of searches on Google for the first two terms are cointegrated. This research indicates that there are strong short-term and long-term dynamics among attractiveness factors, suggesting that an increase in worldwide interest in Bitcoin is usually preceded by a price increase. In contrast, an increase in market mistrust over a collapse of the currency, as measured by the term bitcoin crash, is followed by a fall in price. Intense world economic crisis events appear to have a strong impact on interest in the virtual currency. This study demonstrates that during a worldwide crisis Bitcoin becomes an alternative investment, increasing its price. Based on it, bitcoin may be used as a safe haven by the financial market and its intrinsic characteristics might help the investors and governments to find new mechanisms to deal with monetary transactions.","[das Neves, Rodrigo Hakim] Sao Paulo Sch Econ FGV, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Getulio Vargas Foundation","das Neves, RH (corresponding author), Sao Paulo Sch Econ FGV, Sao Paulo, Brazil.","rodrigohakim@hotmail.com","","","","","","","43","13","13","4","22","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","2199-4730","","FINANC INNOV","Financ.

Its decoupling idea has inspired a new generation of high-performance blockchain protocols. However, the existing incentive analysis of Bitcoin-NG has several limitations. First, the impact of network capacity is ignored. Second, an integrated incentive analysis that jointly considers both key blocks and microblocks is still missing. In this paper, we aim to address these two limitations. First, we propose a new incentive analysis that takes the network capacity into account, showing that Bitcoin-NG can still maintain incentive compatibility against the microblock mining attack even under limited network capacity. Second, we leverage a Markov decision process (MDP) to jointly analyze the incentive of both key blocks and microblocks, showing that the selfish mining revenue of Bitcoin-NG is a little higher than that in Bitcoin only when the selfish miner controls more than 35% of the mining power. We hope that our in-depth incentive analysis for Bitcoin-NG can shed some light on the mechanism design and incentive analysis of next-generation blockchain protocols. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In order to do so, the influence of Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) on Bitcoin returns and volatility was studied. Design/methodology/approach It is evaluated whether, when compared with the evolution of EPU, Bitcoin's returns and volatility show behaviours typical of safe havens or rather, those of conventional speculative assets. When faced with an increase in EPU, safe havens - such as gold - can be expected to increase their returns and volatility, while conventional speculative assets will increase their volatility and reduce their returns. This study uses simple linear regression and quantile regression models on a daily data sample from 19 July 2010 to 11 April 2019, to analyse the influence of EPU on the returns and volatility of Bitcoin and gold. Findings Bitcoin's returns and volatility increase during more uncertain times, just like gold, showing that Bitcoin acts not only as a means of exchange but also shows characteristics of investment assets, specifically of safe havens. These findings provide useful information to investors by allowing Bitcoin to be considered as a tool to protect savings in times of economic uncertainty and to diversify portfolios. Originality/value This study complements and expands current research by aiming to answer the question of whether Bitcoin is a simple speculative asset or a safe haven.

These transactions typically languish in a local buffer until evicted or all their parents are discovered, at which point they may be propagated further. So far, there has been little work in the literature on characterizing the nature and impact of such orphans. Yet, it is intuitive that they should affect performance of the Bitcoin network. This work thus seeks to methodically research such effects through a measurement campaign of orphan transactions on live Bitcoin nodes. Our data show that, surprisingly, orphan transactions tend to have fewer parents on average than non-orphan transactions. The salient features of their missing parents are a lower fee, a larger size, and a lower transaction fee per byte than all other received transactions. We also find out that the network overhead incurred by these orphan transactions can be significant, exceeding 17% when using the default orphan memory pool size (i.e., 100 transactions). However, this overhead can be made negligible, without significant computational or memory demands, if the pool size is simply increased to 1000 transactions.","[Imtiaz, Muhammad Anas; Starobinski, David; Trachtenberg, Ari] Boston Univ, ECE Dept, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Boston University","Imtiaz, MA (corresponding author), Boston Univ, ECE Dept, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","maimtiaz@bu.edu; staro@bu.edu; trachen@bu.edu","","","NSF [CCF-1563753]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was supported in part by NSF under grant CCF-1563753.

Thanks to the fact that the Bitcoin blockchain in publicly available, and considering that it shows properties of a real economy, Bitcoin is becoming more and more often subject of a number of studies. One of the hardest task in this field, yet interesting also from a non specialist point of view, is the bitcoin price correlation and prediction. In this paper we present a methodological framework for the bitcoin exchange graph analysis which helps in focusing only on restricted time spans that show interesting dynamics of the bitcoin price. We also present our study on three separate time spans and show that empirical correlations can be found between the bitcoin price and some bitcoin exchange graph measures. Lastly, with our framework we are also able to detect some unexpected behaviour from particular users which tend to pile up big amounts of bitcoin over the selected time spans.","[Guidi, Barbara; Michienzi, Andrea] Univ Pisa, Dept Comp Sci, I-56127 Pisa, Italy","University of Pisa","Michienzi, A (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Comp Sci, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.","guidi@di.unipi.it; andrea.michienzi@di.unipi.it","","Michienzi, Andrea/0000-0001-8005-8701; Guidi, Barbara/0000-0002-0151-6469","","","","","21","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-48340-1; 978-3-030-48339-5","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2020","11997","","","","","","429","441","","10.1007/978-3-030-48340-1_33","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-48340-1_33","","","13","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7UA","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000850928600033","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system first proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. By design, Bitcoin is a pseudonymous coin, meaning that users can transact with the currency without revealing their true identity. To tackle the challenge of Bitcoin-related crime, a range of deanonymization techniques have been proposed. In general, these solutions are limited by the time and resources required to predict likely transaction owners. In this paper, we propose the first software-defined network (SDN)-based Bitcoin transaction mapping solution. We analyse the Bitcoin transaction process in an SDN environment and demonstrate a deterministic approach to deanonymize users in Bitcoin's network.","[Wallace, Victoria; Scott-Hayward, Sandra] Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Secure Informat Technol, Belfast BT3 9DT, Antrim, North Ireland","Queens University Belfast","Scott-Hayward, S (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Secure Informat Technol, Belfast BT3 9DT, Antrim, North Ireland.","s.scott-hayward@qub.ac.uk","","","","","","","18","0","0","0","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1550-3607","","978-1-7281-5089-5","IEEE ICC","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BQ5PR","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000606970302016","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Design/methodology/approach We construct a Financial and Economic Attitudes Revealed by Search (FEARS) index using search volume from Google's search engine to reveal household-level (bankruptcy, unemployment, job search, etc.) and market-level sentiment (bankruptcy, unemployment, job search, etc.). Findings Using a variety of quantitative methodologies such as the transfer entropy model as well as threshold regression and OLS, GLS and 2SLS estimations, we find that (1) investor sentiment has strong predictive power on Bitcoin, (2) household-level sentiment has larger effects than market-level sentiment and (3) the impact of sentiment is greater in low sentiment regimes than in high sentiment regimes. Based on these information, we build a hypothetical trading strategy that outperforms a simple buy-and-hold strategy both on an absolute and risk-adjusted basis. The results are consistent across cryptocurrencies and regions. Research limitations/implications The findings contribute to the ongoing debate in the literature on the efficiency of cryptocurrency markets. The results reveal that the Bitcoin market is not efficient in the sense of the efficient market hypothesis - asset prices do not fully reflect all available information and we were able to beat the market. In addition, it sheds further light on the debate whether Bitcoin can be considered a medium of exchange, i.e. a currency or an investment product. Because investors are reallocating their Bitcoin holdings during times of increased market sentiment due to liquidity needs, they obviously consider bitcoin an investment product rather than a currency. Originality/value This study is the first to examine the impact of investor sentiment measured by FEARS on Bitcoin return.","[Burggraf, Tobias; Rudolf, Markus] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Chair Finance, Vallendar, Germany; [Huynh, Toan Luu Duc; Wang, Mei] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Chair Behav Finance, Vallendar, Germany","WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management; WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management","Burggraf, T (corresponding author), WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Chair Finance, Vallendar, Germany.","Tobias.Burggraf@whu.edu; toan.huynh@whu.edu; Markus.Rudolf@whu.edu; mei.wang@whu.edu","Huynh, Toan Luu Duc/V-6735-2019","Huynh, Toan Luu Duc/0000-0002-3686-0884; Huynh, Toan Luu Duc/0000-0002-1486-127X","","","","","67","24","24","1","15","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1940-5979","1940-5987","","REV BEHAV FINANCE","Rev.

Its incomparably high returns in recent years has further fuelled intense interest and investment into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at large. This paper cautions that Bitcoin prices, despite their seemingly attractive independent behavior relative to economic variables, may still be exposed to the same types of market risks which afflict the performance of conventional financial assets. Using a Markov regime-switching model to distinguish between regimes of high and low Bitcoin price volatility, this paper shows that while returns on the aggregate market portfolio cannot explain Bitcoin returns, other asset pricing risk factors, such as interest rates and implied stock market and foreign exchange market volatilities, are important determinants of Bitcoin returns. Distinguishing between periods of high and low Bitcoin price volatility reveals heterogeneity in the explanatory power of market risk factors; in particular, Bitcoin returns are more difficult to explain during periods of high volatility relative to periods with low volatility. This finding can partially explain why extant studies, which neglect to distinguish between exchange rate regimes in Bitcoin, have difficulty linking Bitcoin prices to economic fundamentals.","[Koutmos, Dimitrios] Worcester Polytech Inst, 100 Inst Rd, Worcester, MA 01609 USA","Worcester Polytechnic Institute","Koutmos, D (corresponding author), Worcester Polytech Inst, 100 Inst Rd, Worcester, MA 01609 USA.","DKoutmos@WPI.edu","","","","","","","37","34","34","2","24","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0254-5330","1572-9338","","ANN OPER RES","Ann.

Users in the Bitcoin network use pseudonymous Bitcoin addresses and conduct transactions with others without revealing their real identities. In order to further enhance their privacy and convenience, users often use a large number of different addresses. In this paper, we analyze different patterns of transactions occurring in the Bitcoin network in order to cluster addresses that share the same ownership. In order to evaluate the proposed clustering approach, Bitcoin addresses belonging to known entities are tagged and these are used in conjunction with the Gini impurity index to test the accuracy of the recovered identity-based clusters. The results show that our heuristic was able to detect relationships between Bitcoin addresses that were missed by the existing heuristics.","[Chang, Tao-Hung; Svetinovic, Davor] Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Cyber Phys Syst, Abu Dhabi 127788, U Arab Emirates","Khalifa University of Science & Technology","Svetinovic, D (corresponding author), Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Cyber Phys Syst, Abu Dhabi 127788, U Arab Emirates.","davor.svetinovic@ku.ac.ae","Svetinovic, Davor/AAQ-9433-2020","Svetinovic, Davor/0000-0002-3020-9556","","","","","40","13","14","4","21","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2168-2216","2168-2232","","IEEE T SYST MAN CY-S","IEEE Trans.

On the one hand, it is social as it ensures the exchange of value, maintaining trust in a cooperative, community-driven manner without the need for a trusted third party. At the same time, it is anti-social as it creates hurdles for law enforcement to trace suspicious transactions due to anonymity and privacy. To understand how the social and anti-social tendencies in the user base of Bitcoin affect its evolution, there is a need to analyze the Bitcoin system as a network.

To handle a comparable number of transactions, Bitcoin's throughput must be improved, which will require a reduction in the block propagation time. Relay networks have attracted attention as a method to improve throughput. However, the nature and strength of the effects of relay networks are not yet clear. In particular, the effects on individual nodes have received little attention. Thus, this study aims to investigate the effects of relay networks on the Bitcoin network and its nodes under the current network state in approximately 2019. We simulate a relay network under the current network state because simulation is virtually the only way to obtain data for all nodes. A major contribution of this study is that it is the first to investigate the relay network effect on the 90th percentile of block propagation time. Moreover, this study shows that relay networks benefit not only the system but also the nodes utilizing them. The utilizing nodes' blocks were more than six times more likely to be approved as valid blocks when nonutilizing and utilizing nodes generated blocks simultaneously. This finding can motivate the use of nodes in relay networks.","[Otsuki, Kai; Banno, Ryohei; Shudo, Kazuyuki] Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan; [Banno, Ryohei] Kogakuin Univ, Tokyo, Japan","Tokyo Institute of Technology; Kogakuin University","Otsuki, K (corresponding author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan.","ootuki.k.aa@m.titech.ac.jp","Banno, Ryohei/AAB-9445-2019","Banno, Ryohei/0000-0001-7268-4657","SECOM Science and Technology Foundation","SECOM Science and Technology Foundation","This work was supported by SECOM Science and Technology Foundation.","","12","6","6","0","0","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-0-7381-0495-9","","","","2020","","","","","","","214","220","","10.1109/Blockchain50366.2020.00034","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain50366.2020.00034","","","7","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR3LS","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000647642100025","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The proposed scheme can be used to warn relevant institutions to study more secure encryption algorithms to protect users' privacy. Specifically, the important features of a Bitcoin address are extracted. After that, to reduce the computational complexity, we transform the clustering problem of addresses into a binary classification problem in which we integrate the features of two Bitcoin addresses. A novel two-level learner model is then built to analyze if the two Bitcoin addresses are belonging to the same user. Finally we cluster the addresses belonging to the same user accordingly. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the other address association schemes, which use deep learning models or heuristics, and can achieve an increase by 6%-20% in precision and by 10% improvement in recall.","[Liu, Tengyu; Ge, Jingguo; Li, Liangxiong; Yao, Zhongjiang; Wen, Jifei; Shi, Hongbin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Liu, Tengyu; Ge, Jingguo; Li, Liangxiong; Yao, Zhongjiang; Wen, Jifei; Shi, Hongbin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Cyber Secur, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yulei] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Dai, Bowei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Microelect, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Engineering, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Exeter; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Microelectronics, CAS","Ge, JG (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.;Ge, JG (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Cyber Secur, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.","gejingguo@iie.ac.cn","","","","","","","33","5","5","0","5","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-38961-1; 978-3-030-38960-4","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2020","11945","","","","","","349","364","","10.1007/978-3-030-38961-1_31","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-38961-1_31","","","16","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR5HX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000655399100031","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Our empirical results provide evidence endorsing our hypothesis. Gold and crude, Brent Crude and West Texas Intermediate oil prices have negative and remarkable effects on the natural logarithm of Bitcoin. Coal and natural gas have equally positive effects on Bitcoin, although they do not necessarily share the same significance. Natural gas has an insignificant impact on Bitcoin's return compared with coal. Our findings show that both Bitcoin and coal would serve as hedges for oil and gold. For Bitcoin investors, the results imply the ability to use data about oil, gold and coal returns to improve predictions of Bitcoin returns.

The Bitcoin network also employs public key cryptography to prevent the disclosure of information related to participating users. Although the public key cryptography ensures the privacy and hides the true identity of users in the Bitcoin network, it has recently been abused for illegal activities that have tarnished the charm of this novel technology. Detecting the illegal transactions associated with illicit activities in Bitcoin is therefore imperative. This paper proposes a machine-learning based approach that classifies Bitcoin transactions as illegal or legal. The detected illegal transactions can be excluded from the subsequent block, promoting user acceptance and adoption of the Bitcoin technology.","[Lee, Chaehyeon; Maharjan, Sajan; Ko, Kyungchan; Hong, James Won-Ki] POSTECH, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Pohang 37673, South Korea","Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH)","Lee, C (corresponding author), POSTECH, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Pohang 37673, South Korea.","chlee0211@postech.ac.kr; thesajan@postech.ac.kr; kkc90@postech.ac.kr; jwkhong@postech.ac.kr","","","ICT R&D program of MSIT/IITP [2018-0-00539, 2018-0-00749]; MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program [IITP-2017-2017-0-01633]","ICT R&D program of MSIT/IITP(Institute for Information & Communication Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP), Republic of Korea); MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program(Ministry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by the ICT R&D program of MSIT/IITP.

After exploding its price twenty times just in the twelve months of 2017, the tone has changed dramatically in 2018 after major price corrections and increasing concerns about its mining power consumption and overall sustainability. The dynamics and interaction between Bitcoin price and its mining costs have become of major interest. Here we show that these two quantities are tightly interconnected and they tend to a common long-term equilibrium. Mining costs adjust to the cryptocurrency price with the adjustment time of several months up to a year. Current developments suggest that we have arrived at a new era of Bitcoin mining where marginal (electricity) costs and mining efficiency play the prime role.

Bitcoin is an electronic payment system based on cryptography rather than on credit. Regardless of whether people are in the same city or country, bitcoin can be sent by any one person to any other person when they reach an agreement. The market value of bitcoin has been rising since its advent in 2009, and its current market value is US160 billion. Since its development, bitcoin itself has exposed many problems and is facing challenges from all the sectors of society; therefore, adversaries may use bitcoin's weakness to make considerable profits. This survey presents an overview and detailed investigation of data security and privacy in bitcoin system. We examine the studies in the literature/Web in two categories: 1) analyses of the attacks to the privacy, availability, and consistency of bitcoin data and 2) summaries of the countermeasures for bitcoin data security. Based on the literature/Web, we list and describe the research methods and results for the two categories. We compare the performance of these methods and illustrate the relationship between the performance and the methods. Moreover, we present several important open research directions to identify the follow-up studies in this area.","[Zhu, Lie-Huang; Zheng, Bao-Kun; Shen, Meng; Gao, Feng; Li, Hong-Yu; Shi, Ke-Xin] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Bao-Kun] China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Informat Management Law, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Shen, Meng] Minist Publ Secur, Key Lab Informat Network Secur, Shanghai 201204, Peoples R China","Beijing Institute of Technology; China University of Political Science & Law; Ministry of Public Security (China)","Shen, M (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Shen, M (corresponding author), Minist Publ Secur, Key Lab Informat Network Secur, Shanghai 201204, Peoples R China.","liehuangz@bit.edu.cn; zhengbk168@163.com; shenmeng@bit.edu.cn; gaofengbit@foxmail.com; lihongyu@bit.edu.cn; 18222962076@163.com","","","Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province of China [2019B010137003]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1836212, 61972039, 61872041, 61602039, 61871037]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation of China [4192050]; Key Laboratory of Information Network Security, Ministry of Public Security; Pre-Study Foundation of Weapons and Equipment [31511020401]","Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation of China(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); Key Laboratory of Information Network Security, Ministry of Public Security; Pre-Study Foundation of Weapons and Equipment","This work was supported by the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province of China under Grant No. 2019B010137003, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos.

The research is based on Bitcoin-USA dollar prices from the beginning of 2012 until the end of March 2020. Such a long period of time that includes volatile periods with strong up and downtrends introduces challenges to any forecasting system. We use particle swarm optimization to find the best forecasting combinations of setups. Results show that Bitcoin's price changes do not follow the Random Walk efficient market hypothesis and that both Darvas Box and Linear Regression techniques can help traders to predict the bitcoin's price trends. We also find that both methodologies work better predicting an uptrend than a downtrend. The best setup for the Darvas Box strategy is six days of formation. A Darvas box uptrend signal was found efficient predicting four sequential daily returns while a downtrend signal faded after two days on average. The best setup for the Linear Regression model is 42 days with 1 standard deviation.","[Cohen, Gil] Western Galilee Acad Coll, Dept Management, POB 2125, IL-2412101 Akko, Israel","","Cohen, G (corresponding author), Western Galilee Acad Coll, Dept Management, POB 2125, IL-2412101 Akko, Israel.","gilc@wgalil.ac.il","Chanelian, Serena/ABE-4873-2021; cohen, gil/CAA-0988-2022","Chanelian, Serena/0000-0001-5727-6137; cohen, gil/0000-0002-5176-4583; COHEN, GIL/0000-0002-1173-0338","","","","","23","12","12","4","17","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1099-4300","","ENTROPY-SWITZ","Entropy","AUG","2020","22","8","","","","","","","838","10.3390/e22080838","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e22080838","","","11","Physics, Multidisciplinary","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Physics","NG7KR","33286608","gold, Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000564160100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

An adversary should not be able to discover the relation between bitcoin addresses and bitcoin users to ensure effective privacy. However, the relation among bitcoin transactions can be used to analyze the bitcoin privacy information, which seriously jeopardizes the bitcoin anonymity. Herein, we describe the vulnerabilities associated with the anonymity mechanism of bitcoin, including the relation among bitcoin addresses and the relation among bitcoin users. Further, we demonstrate that the existing methods do not guarantee the comprehensiveness, accuracy, and efficiency of the analysis results. We propose a heuristic clustering method to judge the relation among bitcoin addresses and employ the Louvain method to discover the relation among bitcoin users. Subsequently, we construct an address-associated database of historical transactions and implement real-time updates. Extensive experiments are used to demonstrate the comprehensiveness, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed scheme. Specifically, the proposed scheme reveals the privacy vulnerability associated with the blockchain technology. We expect that our scheme can be applied to improve the blockchain technology.","[Zheng, Baokun; Zhu, Liehuang; Shen, Meng] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Baokun] China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Informat Management Law, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Du, Xiaojiang] Temple Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Guizani, Mohsen] Qatar Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Doha 2713, Qatar","Beijing Institute of Technology; China University of Political Science & Law; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Qatar University","Zhu, LH; Shen, M (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.","liehuangz@bit.edu.cn; shenmeng@bit.edu.cn","Guizani, Mohsen/AAX-4534-2021","Guizani, Mohsen/0000-0002-8972-8094","National Cryptography Development Fund [MMJJ20180412]","National Cryptography Development Fund","This work was supported by National Cryptography Development Fund (GrantNo. MMJJ20180412).","","32","17","21","6","19","SCIENCE PRESS","BEIJING","16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA","1674-733X","1869-1919","","SCI CHINA INFORM SCI","Sci.

Despite the benefits of its blockchain, Bitcoin still faces serious scalability issues, most importantly its ever-increasing blockchain size. While alternative designs introduced schemes to periodically create snapshots and thereafter prune older blocks, already-deployed systems such as Bitcoin are often considered incapable of adopting corresponding approaches. In this work, we revise this popular belief and present CoinPrune, a snapshot-based pruning scheme that is fully compatible with Bitcoin. CoinPrune can be deployed through an opt-in velvet fork, i.e., without impeding the established Bitcoin network. By requiring miners to publicly announce and jointly reaffirm recent snapshots on the blockchain, CoinPrune establishes trust into the snapshots' correctness even in the presence of powerful adversaries. Our evaluation shows that CoinPrune reduces the storage requirements of Bitcoin already by two orders of magnitude today, with further relative savings as the blockchain grows. In our experiments, nodes only have to fetch and process 5 GiB instead of 230 GiB of data when joining the network, reducing the synchronization time on powerful devices from currently 5 h to 46 min, with even more savings for less powerful devices.","[Matzutt, Roman; Kalde, Benedikt; Pennekamp, Jan; Wehrle, Klaus] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Commun & Distributed Syst, Aachen, Germany; [Drichel, Arthur] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, IT Secur Res Grp, Aachen, Germany; [Henze, Martin] Fraunhofer FKIE, Cyber Anal & Def, Wachtberg, Germany","RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University","Matzutt, R (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Commun & Distributed Syst, Aachen, Germany.","matzutt@comsys.rwth-aachen.de; kalde@comsys.rwth-aachen.de; pennekamp@comsys.rwth-aachen.de; drichel@itsec.rwth-aachen.de; martin.henze@fkie.fraunhofer.de; wehrle@comsys.rwth-aachen.de","Henze, Martin/I-3623-2014; Pennekamp, Jan/AAD-5622-2020","Henze, Martin/0000-0001-8717-2523; Pennekamp, Jan/0000-0003-0398-6904; Wehrle, Klaus/0000-0001-7252-4186; Matzutt, Roman/0000-0002-4263-5317","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [16KIS0443, 16DHLQ013]; Z31 BMBF Digital Campus; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Z31 BMBF Digital Campus(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD))","This work has been funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under funding reference numbers 16KIS0443, 16DHLQ013, and Z31 BMBF Digital Campus.

An integrated overview of the empirical findings generated by the nascent but increasingly proliferating literature concerning the nexus between Bitcoin and gold is provided. The majority of evidence reveals that Bitcoin has a long way to go before it acquires the same characteristics as the safe-haven asset of gold. Overall, Bitcoin is found to be an efficient hedge against oil and stock market indices, but to a lesser extent than gold. Bitcoin presents low or negative correlations or an asymmetric non-linear linkage with gold. Despite sharing some common features with traditional assets, Bitcoin is found to be a good hedging asset in portfolios with gold. Moreover, evidence reveals that gold is a better and more stable safe-haven investment than Bitcoin.","[Kyriazis, Nikolaos A.] Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, Volos 38333, Greece","University of Thessaly","Kyriazis, NA (corresponding author), Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, Volos 38333, Greece.","knikolaos@uth.gr","","KYRIAZIS, NIKOLAOS/0000-0002-1260-4448","","","","","73","14","14","9","38","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

The 32.4 million OP Return transactions (22% of all Bitcoin transactions) published during this period added 10 GB to the blockchain's size. Almost all OP Return transactions can be attributed to one of 37 blockchain services. The two dominant services are Veriblock (58% of OP Return transactions) and Omni/Tether (40%). Veriblock transactions pay only 14% of the average transaction fee, partly because most of them are submitted during times when overall activity on Bitcoin is low. Omni transactions, on the other hand, pay more than twice the average transaction fee and therefore compete with regular Bitcoin transactions for inclusion in new blocks.","[Strehle, Elias; Steinmetz, Fred] Blockchain Res Lab, Max Brauer Allee 46, D-22765 Hamburg, Germany; [Steinmetz, Fred] Univ Hamburg, Fac Business, Econ, Social Sci, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany","University of Hamburg","Steinmetz, F (corresponding author), Blockchain Res Lab, Max Brauer Allee 46, D-22765 Hamburg, Germany.","strehle@blockchainresearchlab.org; fred.steinmetz@uni-hamburg.de","","Steinmetz, Fred/0000-0003-1645-6339; Strehle, Elias/0000-0002-4351-7865","Projekt DEAL","Projekt DEAL","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.","","19","1","1","0","3","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1570-7873","1572-9184","","J GRID COMPUT","J.

Bitcoin is currently considered as one of the most disruptive technologies. Bitcoin represents a paradox of opposing forces. On one hand, it is fundamentally social, allowing people to transact in a peer-to-peer manner to create and exchange value. On the other hand, Bitcoin's core design philosophy and user base contain strong anti-social elements and constraints, emphasizing anonymity, privacy, and subversion of traditional centralized financial systems. We believe that the success of Bitcoin, and the financial ecosystem built around it, will likely rely on achieving an optimal balance between these social and anti-social forces. To elucidate the role of these forces, we analyze the evolution of the entire Bitcoin transaction graph from its inception, and quantify the evolution of its key structural properties. We observe that despite its different nature, the Bitcoin transaction graph exhibits many universal dynamics typical of social networks. However, we also find that Bitcoin deviates in important ways due to anonymity-seeking behavioral patterns of its users. As a result, the network exhibits a two-orders-of-magnitude larger diameter, sparse tree-like communities, and an overwhelming majority of transitional or intermediate accounts with incoming and outgoing edges but zero cumulative balances. These results illuminate the evolutionary dynamics of the most popular cryptocurrency, and provide us with initial understanding of social networks rooted in and driven by anti-social constraints.","[Alqassem, Israa] Purdue Univ, Dept Comp Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Rahwan, Iyad] MIT, Media Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Svetinovic, Davor] Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Cyber Phys Syst, Dept Comp Sci, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Khalifa University of Science & Technology","Svetinovic, D (corresponding author), Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Cyber Phys Syst, Dept Comp Sci, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.","ialqasse@purdue.edu; irahwan@mit.edu; davor.svetinovic@ku.ac.ae","Rahwan, Iyad/ABB-2422-2020; Svetinovic, Davor/AAQ-9433-2020","Rahwan, Iyad/0000-0002-1796-4303; Svetinovic, Davor/0000-0002-3020-9556","","","","","41","23","24","3","3","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2168-2216","2168-2232","","IEEE T SYST MAN CY-S","IEEE Trans.

A mere observation of the price rise and a comparison with the common characteristics of a bubble provide anecdotal evidence for the bitcoin bubble. Based on price and volume data up to the end of November 2017, formal empirical evidence is presented by using procedures that do not require the estimation of a fundamental value for bitcoin. The empirical evidence shows that (i) the volume of trading can be explained predominantly in terms of price dynamics; (ii) trading in bitcoin is based exclusively on technical considerations pertaining to past price movements, particularly positive price changes; and (iii) the price of bitcoin is an explosive process.

Address clustering aims to break such pseudoanonymity by linking addresses that are controlled by the same user based on the information available from the blockchain, such as transaction graphs. There are already two widely used heuristics for Bitcoin address clustering. One is based on the multiple input addresses of transactions. The other is based on one-time change addresses. By reconsidering the one-time change address-based heuristic from the perspective of address reuse, we propose a new heuristic that detects one-time change addresses by eliminating addresses that are reused later as non-change addresses. As a result, this heuristic works for transactions whose one-time change addresses cannot be identified by the previous two heuristics. The experimental results for different scales of Bitcoin transaction data show that the proposed heuristic has a 0.33% mean contribution to the ratio of address reduction in addition to the contribution of the multiple input addresses and one-time change address heuristics.","[Zhang, Yuhang; Wang, Jun] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Luo, Jie] Beihang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Software Dev Environm, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China","Beihang University; Beihang University","Wang, J (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.;Luo, J (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Software Dev Environm, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.","king.wang@buaa.edu.cn; luojie@nlsde.buaa.edu.cn","","Luo, Jie/0000-0002-4157-9931","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71871005, 71531001]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71871005 and Grant 71531001.","","26","6","7","1","5","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","210582","210591","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3039570","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3039570","","","10","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","PA9TC","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000595969800001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

By selecting ten interpretable influence factors from the bitcoin network and using copula theory, we find that the bitcoin price has different correlation structures with its influence factors.

In this paper, we explore as to whether cryptocurrency returns, as represented by Bitcoin, exhibit similar asymmetric reverting patterns for minutely, hourly, daily and weekly returns between June 2010 and February 2018. We identify several differences in the behaviour of Bitcoin price returns in the pre- and post-$1000 sub-periods and evidence of asymmetric reverting patterns in the Bitcoin price returns under all the ANAR models employed, regardless of the data frequency considered. We also present evidence indicating stronger reverting behaviour of negative price returns in terms of both reverting speed and magnitude compared to positive returns and evidence of positive serial correlation with prior positive price returns. Finally, we also investigated asymmetries in Bitcoin price return series' persistence by employing higher order ANAR models, finding evidence of a higher persistence of positive returns than negative returns, a result that further supports the existence of asymmetric reverting behaviour in the Bitcoin price returns.","[Corbet, Shaen] Dublin City Univ, DCU Business Sch, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Katsiampa, Paraskevi] Sheffield Hallam Univ, Sheffield Business Sch, Sheffield S1 1WB, S Yorkshire, England","Dublin City University; Sheffield Hallam University","Corbet, S (corresponding author), Dublin City Univ, DCU Business Sch, Dublin 9, Ireland.","shaen.corbet@dcu.ie","Corbet, Shaen/B-4869-2017","Corbet, Shaen/0000-0001-7430-7417; Katsiampa, Paraskevi/0000-0003-0477-6503","","","","","47","21","21","3","11","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1057-5219","1873-8079","","INT REV FINANC ANAL","Int.

It allows people to trade directly without going through financial institutions such as banks. This model results in many transactions that occur outside the law and beyond ethical constraints. In such an anonymous environment, the large number of entities using Bitcoin, and the huge scale or the Bitcoin trading network make it difficult for users to have a rough idea of the entire trading network before transaction. Thus, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to summarize the research problems, achievements and possible research trends based on Bitcoin data analysis. Therefore, in this paper we review the literatures about data analysis on Bitcoin transaction entities. Starting from the relevant conceptual framework of Bitcoin, this paper divides the existing research models into three categories, heuristic algorithm identification of entities, transaction descriptive statistics and network analysis, and visual system analysis. By analyzing the transaction entity, Bitcoin transaction data can he processed in a manner which is similar to an account, such as a bank or credit card, thereby achieving the purpose of in-depth analysis of all transaction activities related to the account entity. Finally, we summarize the data analysis results of Bitcoin transaction network and prospects of the future research directions.","[He Xi; He Ketai] Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Mech Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang Fan] Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Comp & Commun Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lin Shenwen; Mao Hongliang] Coordinat Ctr China, Natl Comp Network Emergency Response Tech Team, Beijing, Peoples R China","University of Science & Technology Beijing; University of Science & Technology Beijing","He, KT (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Mech Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.","18722227972@ustb.edu.cn; fanzhang@xs.ustb.edu.cn; lsw@cert.org.cn; mhl@cert.org.cn; heketai@ustb.edu.cn","","","National key R&D program of China [2019QY(Y)0601]","National key R&D program of China","The authors acknowledge the support by National key R&D program of China under Grant No. 2019QY(Y)0601.","","29","0","0","1","10","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2156-2318","","978-1-7281-5169-4","C IND ELECT APPL","","","2020","","","","","","","159","164","","","","","","6","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering","BR3IM","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000646627000028","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It would be sufficient to show that Bitcoin uses a dual-stack architecture that acts as a dual counter machine. Such systems have already been demonstrated as being Turing complete. We demonstrate that Bitcoin script is a minimal family of which lambda lambda and R are members. Further, using the compositional product rule and the iteration rule, we demonstrate that Bitcoin scripting is Turing complete with the limitations imposed on any real-world computer. The limitation is that there cannot be an infinite tape. Iterations can be simulated using an unrolled loop function with allocation to the Alt stack. As the product rule says, if A, B are machines, then A.B is also a machine. The iteration rule shows that if A is a machine, then (A) is also a machine. Further, the minimum power of A under which the observed square of the final configuration is blank. The consequence of such rules is that for every partial recursive function of in variables we can show that it can be evaluated by a machine of the proposed family.","[Wright, Craig S.] CNAM, Paris, France","heSam Universite; Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay","Wright, CS (corresponding author), CNAM, Paris, France.","c.wright@nchain.com","","","","","","","20","1","1","0","2","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","2194-5357","2194-5365","978-3-030-29516-5; 978-3-030-29515-8","ADV INTELL SYST COMP","","","2020","1037","","","","","","299","313","","10.1007/978-3-030-29516-5_23","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-29516-5_23","","","15","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR2DE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000637312900023","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We applied Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), for the period from 9 April 2017 to 30 June 2018, using daily closing prices, with a total of 429 observations. We focused on two prices of Bitcoins resulting from negotiations made by two different Brazilian financial institutions: Foxbit and Mercado. The results indicate that Mercado and Foxbit returns tend to follow Bitcoin dynamics and all of them show persistent behavior, although the persistence in slightly higher for the Brazilian Bitcoin. However, this evidence does not necessarily mean opportunities for abnormal profits, as aspects such as liquidity or transaction costs could be impediments to this occurrence.","[Quintino, Derick; Campoli, Jessica; Burnquist, Heloisa] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ Adm & Sociol, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, Brazil; [Ferreira, Paulo] VALORIZA Res Ctr Endogenous Resource Valorizat, P-7300 Portalegre, Portugal; [Ferreira, Paulo] Inst Politecn Portalegre, P-7300 Portalegre, Portugal; [Ferreira, Paulo] Univ Evora, IIFA, CEFAGE UE, Largo Colegiais 2, P-7000 Evora, Portugal","Universidade de Sao Paulo; Instituto Politecnico de Portalegre; University of Evora","Ferreira, P (corresponding author), VALORIZA Res Ctr Endogenous Resource Valorizat, P-7300 Portalegre, Portugal.;Ferreira, P (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Portalegre, P-7300 Portalegre, Portugal.;Ferreira, P (corresponding author), Univ Evora, IIFA, CEFAGE UE, Largo Colegiais 2, P-7000 Evora, Portugal.","derickdq@usp.br; jessica.campoli@usp.br; hlburnqu@usp.br; pferreira@ipportalegre.pt","Quintino, Derick/AAY-4436-2020; Ferreira, Paulo/P-9622-2016","Quintino, Derick/0000-0002-9382-8442; Ferreira, Paulo/0000-0003-1951-889X; BURNQUIST, HELOISA/0000-0001-9856-0118","CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel); CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development); Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UIDB/05064/2020, UIDB/04007/2020]","CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission)","D.

Bitcoin is widely flourished digital currency and an exchange trading commodity implementing peer-to-peer payment network. No central athourity exists in Bitcoin. The users in network or pool of bitcoin need not to use real names, rather they use pseudo names for managing and verifying transactions. Due to the use of pseudo names bitcoin is apprehended to provide anonymity. However, the most transparent payment network is what bitcoin is. Here all the transactions are publicly open. To furnish wholeness and put a stop to double-spending, Blockchain is used, which actually works as a ledger for management of Bitcoins. Blockchain can be misused to monitor flow of bitcoins among multiple transactions. When data from external sources is amalgamated with insinuation acquired from the Blockchain, it may result to reveal user's identity and profile. In this way the activity of user may be traced to an extent to fraud that user. Along with the popularity of Bitcoins the number of adversarial attacks has also gain pace.

First, our findings show that Bitcoin returns are mean-reverting which implies that its value tends to come down to mean value in the long run and not completely crushed to zero irrespective of price changes suggesting Bitcoin as a sustainable asset class. Second, the time-invariant model shows that Bitcoin offers portfolio diversification opportunities with almost all equity indices, in particular, Dow Jones Islamic followed by FTSE 4 Good index. Finally, the time-variant analysis reconfirms that Bitcoin offers portfolio diversification benefits both in the short and long run.

This study investigates roughness or the anti-persistence of Bitcoin volatility. Using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis, we obtain the generalized Hurst exponent of the log-volatility increments and find that the generalized Hurst exponent is less than 1/2, which indicates rough log-volatility increments. Furthermore, we find that the generalized Hurst exponent is not constant. This observation indicates that the log-volatility has a multifractal property. Using shuffled time series of the log-volatility increments, we infer that the source of multifractality partly derives from the distributional property.","[Takaishi, Tetsuya] Hiroshima Univ Econ, Hiroshima 7310192, Japan","Hiroshima University","Takaishi, T (corresponding author), Hiroshima Univ Econ, Hiroshima 7310192, Japan.","tt-taka@hue.ac.jp","","","JSPS KAKENHI [JP18K01556]; ISM Cooperative Research Program [2018-ISMCRP-0006]","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); ISM Cooperative Research Program","Numerical calculations for this work were carried out at the Yukawa Institute Computer Facility and at the facilities of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics.

The hedging potential of gold is comparatively higher for large-cap portfolios, whereas Bitcoin offers minimal hedging effectiveness. However, Bitcoin shows hedging potential for the noncyclical industries. Although investors need a higher amount of investment to hedge the downside risk using gold, it still is a superior hedging instrument compared with Bitcoin.

In this paper, we explore the dynamic interdependence between Bitcoin and the ten global industry sectors classified by the Global Industry Classification Standard. We find, in accordance with previous literature, that Bitcoin is relatively isolated from traditional industries. While the near-zero correlation with traditional financial assets offers some diversification benefits to investors, these benefits are counterbalanced by the volatility of the asset. Bitcoin's optimal presence in a minimum variance portfolio is only about 1 percent - a weight that is robust to various methods for estimating the return covariance matrix. Bitcoin's optimal weight in portfolios maximizing Sharpe and Sortino ratios are on the magnitude of 10 to 20 percent. Hence, the value of Bitcoin as an asset in a diversified portfolio critically depends on investors' views about the future of Blockchain technology.

We use the principal component-guided sparse regression (PC-LASSO) model to analyze several sample sizes for the pre and post periods. Besides the neighbourhood of the break time, the current period is also investigated as returns start to recover after some time. Search intensity is observed to be the most important variable for Bitcoin for all periods, whereas for the other cryptocurrencies there are other variables that seem more important in the pre period, while search intensity still stands out in the post period. Furthermore, GARCH analyses suggest that search intensity increases the volatility of Bitcoin returns more in the post period than it does in the pre period. Our empirical findings suggest that the top five cryptocurrencies are substitutes before the launch of Bitcoin futures. However, this effect is lost, and moreover, there are spillover effects on altcoins during both the post and the recovery period. We find a spillover effect of the introduction of bitcoin futures on altcoins and this effect seems to persist during the recovery period.","[Deniz, Pinar] Marmara Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey; [Stengos, Thanasis] Univ Guelph, Dept Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Marmara University; University of Guelph","Deniz, P (corresponding author), Marmara Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey.","pinar.deniz@marmara.edu.tr; tstengos@uoguelph.ca","Deniz, Pinar/AAC-3440-2021","Deniz, Pinar/0000-0001-5693-1144","","","","","36","3","3","1","2","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

We apply the log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) confidence indicator as a diagnostic tool for identifying bubbles using the daily data on Bitcoin price in the past two years. We find that the LPPLS confidence indicator based on the daily Bitcoin price data fails to provide effective warnings for detecting the bubbles when the Bitcoin price suffers from a large fluctuation in a short time, especially for positive bubbles. In order to diagnose the existence of bubbles and accurately predict the bubble crashes in the cryptocurrency market, this study proposes an adaptive multilevel time series detection methodology based on the LPPLS model and a finer (than daily) timescale for the Bitcoin price data. We adopt two levels of time series, 1 h and 30 min, to demonstrate the adaptive multilevel time series detection methodology. The results show that the LPPLS confidence indicator based on this new method is an outstanding instrument to effectively detect the bubbles and accurately forecast the bubble crashes, even if a bubble exists in a short time. In addition, we discover that the short-term LPPLS confidence indicator being highly sensitive to the extreme fluctuations of Bitcoin price can provide some useful insights into the bubble status on a shorter time scale - on a day to week scale, while the long-term LPPLS confidence indicator has a stable performance in terms of effectively monitoring the bubble status on a longer time scale - on a week to month scale. The adaptive multilevel time series detection methodology can provide real-time detection of bubbles and advanced forecast of crashes to warn of the imminent risk in not only the cryptocurrency market but also other financial markets.

The availability of the complete historical bookkeeping opens up an unprecedented possibility: that of understanding the evolution of a cryptocurrency's network structure while gaining useful insights into the relationships between users' behavior and cryptocurrency pricing in exchange markets. In this article we review some recent results concerning the structural properties of the Bitcoin Transaction Networks, a generic name referring to a set of three different constructs: the Bitcoin Address Network, the Bitcoin User Network, and the Bitcoin Lightning Network. The picture that emerges is of a system growing over time, which becomes increasingly sparse and whose mesoscopic structural organization is characterized by the presence of an increasingly significant core-periphery structure. Such a peculiar topology is accompanied by a highly uneven distribution of bitcoins, a result suggesting that Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly centralized system at different levels.","[Vallarano, Nicolo; Squartini, Tiziano] IMT Sch Adv Studies, NETWORKS Unit, Lucca, Italy; [Tessone, Claudio J.] Univ Zurich, UZH Blockchain Ctr, Zurich, Switzerland; [Tessone, Claudio J.] Univ Zurich, URPP Social Networks, Zurich, Switzerland","IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca; University of Zurich; University of Zurich","Tessone, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, UZH Blockchain Ctr, Zurich, Switzerland.;Tessone, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, URPP Social Networks, Zurich, Switzerland.","claudio.tessone@business.uzh.ch","","Tessone, Claudio J./0000-0001-7733-6221","University of Zurich through the University Research Priority Program on Social Networks; EU [871042]","University of Zurich through the University Research Priority Program on Social Networks; EU(European Commission)","CJT acknowledges financial support from the University of Zurich through the University Research Priority Program on Social Networks.

We provide a comprehensive analytical model for the churning process. We use a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) to describe the behavior of a node, and then apply the results to model the changes in connectivity and the impact on network performance. We analyze the time needed to resynchronize a node upon rejoining the network and find that sleep times of the order of hours require synchronization times limited by a minute. We estimate the impact of sleep and synchronization time on overall network connectivity and block/transaction distribution time. Our results show that networks with less than 4000 nodes are sensitive to churn. This occurs due to opposing impact of decrease in network size (and diameter) due to sleep time and increase of communication load per node. However, the impact of churn on network with more than 4000 nodes is noticeable but small enough to make a large Bitcoin network fairly resilient to churn.","[Motlagh, Saeideh G.; Misic, Jelena; Misic, Vojislav B.] Ryerson Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Fac Sci, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada","Toronto Metropolitan University","Misic, VB (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Fac Sci, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada.","sgholamrezazadeh@ryerson.ca; jmisic@ryerson.ca; vmisic@ryerson.ca","","G.

We apply bootstrap full- and subsample rolling-window Granger causality tests to explore the causal relationship between Bitcoin price (BCP) and gold price (GP). The empirical results show that an increase in BCP can cause GP to decrease, indicating that the prosperity of the Bitcoin market undermines the hedging ability of gold. However, a decrease in BCP causes GP to increase, and it also emphasizes that the ability of gold to avoid risks persists. Hence, the status of gold will not be completely threatened by Bitcoin, and they are complementary to each other instead of in competition. In turn, both positive and negative influences of GP on BCP suggest that fluctuations in BCP can be predicted through the gold market. In situations of severe global uncertainty and complicated investment environments, investors can benefit from complementary markets to optimize their asset allocation. Additionally, countries can grasp the trends in Bitcoin and gold prices to prevent large fluctuations in both markets and to reduce the uncertainty of the financial system.","[Su, Chi-Wei] Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Qin, Meng] Natl Acad Governance, Grad Acad, Party Sch Cent Comm Communist Party China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Tao, Ran] Qingdao Municipal Ctr Dis Control & Preventat, Noncommunicable Chron Dis, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaoyan] Shanxi Univ Finance & Econ, Natl Acad Econ Strategy, Chinese Acad Social Sci, Sch Finance, Taiyuan, Peoples R China","Qingdao University; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Shanxi University Finance & Economics","Qin, M (corresponding author), Natl Acad Governance, Grad Acad, Party Sch Cent Comm Communist Party China, Beijing, Peoples R China.","meng575316928@126.com","Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021","","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M650946]","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation)","This paper has been supported by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No.2019M650946).","","59","11","11","1","13","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1331-677X","1848-9664","","ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ","Ekon.

Specifically, the authors explore how distinct these patterns are and their potential value for intelligence exploitation in support of countering ransomware attacks. Design/methodology/approach The authors created an analytic framework - the Ransomware-Bitcoin Intelligence-Forensic Continuum framework - to search for transaction patterns in the blockchain records from actual ransomware attacks. Data of a number of different ransomware Bitcoin addresses was extracted to populate the framework, via the WalletExplorer.com programming interface. This data was then assembled in a representation of the target network for pattern analysis on the input (cash-in) and output (cash-out) side of the ransomware seed addresses. Different graph algorithms were applied to these networks. The results were compared to a control network derived from a Bitcoin charity. Findings The findings show discernible patterns in the network relating to the input and output side of the ransomware graphs. However, these patterns are not easily distinguishable from those associated with the charity Bitcoin address on the input side. Nonetheless, the collection profile over time is more volatile than with the charity Bitcoin address. On the other hand, ransomware output patterns differ from those associated charity addresses, as the attacker cash-out tactics are quite different from the way charities mobilise their donations. We further argue that an application of graph machine learning provides a basis for future analysis and data refinement possibilities. Research limitations/implications Limitations are evident in the sample size of data taken on ransomware campaigns and the control subject. Further analysis of additional ransomware campaigns and control subjects over time would help refine and validate the preliminary observations in this paper. Future research will also benefit from the application of more powerful computing resources and analytics platforms that scale with the amount of data being collected. Originality/value This research contributes to the maturity of the field by analysing ransomware-Bitcoin behaviour using the Ransomware-Bitcoin Intelligence-Forensic Continuum. By combining several different techniques to discerning patterns of ransomware activity on the Bitcoin network, it provides insight into whether a ransomware attack is occurring and could be used to trigger alerts to seek additional evidence of attack, or could corroborate other information in the system.","[Turner, Adam B.; McCombie, Stephen; Uhlmann, Allon J.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Secur Studies & Criminol, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Macquarie University","Turner, AB (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Secur Studies & Criminol, Sydney, NSW, Australia.","adam.turner07@gmail.com; stephen.mccombie@mq.edu.au; allon.uhlmann@mq.edu.au","Turner, Adam/AAP-5610-2020","McCombie, Stephen/0000-0002-6511-9382; Turner, Adam/0000-0002-3261-0634; Uhlmann, Allon J./0000-0003-1167-0125","","","","","31","3","3","2","16","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1758-7808","1368-5201","","J MONEY LAUND CONTRO","J.

The heavy tails in Bitcoin returns can cause infinite auto-covariances which make the analysis of long memory and market efficiency in Bitcoin based on estimation of Hurst exponent inappropriate. Few literatures focus on this problem. We provide two approaches based on shuffling method and rank-ordered technique to this problem, and further combine them to analyse the time-varying efficiency and long memory in Bitcoin using sliding window. Results show that the inefficiency and long memory exist in Bitcoin before 2014 and after mid-2017. Especially, the latest data reveal a recent new change that the Bitcoin market has become inefficient and exhibited long memory behaviour since mid-2017, but is turning back to efficiency recently. This change may be due to the frequent key events of Bitcoin in 2017 and 2018, which can break the weak efficiency of Bitcoin. The heavy negative tails with a < 2 before September 2016 validate the necessity of our analysis under heavy tails. Besides, the change trend and exact sub-periods of efficiency and long memory are first obtained via empirical mode decomposition of Hurst exponent estimates.","[Wu, Liang; Chen, Shujuan] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Stat Res, Sch Stat, 555 Liutai Ave, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China","Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China","Wu, L (corresponding author), Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Stat Res, Sch Stat, 555 Liutai Ave, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.","wuliang@swufe.edu.cn","","Wu, Liang/0000-0002-7210-9107","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61903309]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [JBK1806002, JBK140507]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [61903309] and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [JBK1806002, JBK140507].","","44","10","10","2","7","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0003-6846","1466-4283","","APPL ECON","Appl.

Services such as Bitcoin and Tor were introduced to provide anonymity for online transactions and Web browsing. Due to its pseudonymity model, Bitcoin lacks retroactive operational security, which means historical pieces of information could be used to identify a certain user. By exploiting publicly available information, we show how relying on Bitcoin for payments on Tor hidden services could lead to deanonymization of these services' users. Such linking is possible by finding at least one past transaction in the Blockchain that involves their publicly declared Bitcoin addresses. To demonstrate the consequences of this deanonymization approach, we carried out a real-world experiment simulating a passive, limited adversary. We crawled 1.5K hidden services and collected 88 unique and active Bitcoin addresses. We then crawled 5B tweets and 1M BitcoinTalk forum pages and collected 4.2K and 41K unique Bitcoin addresses, respectively. Each user address was associated with an online identity along with its public profile information. By analyzing the transactions in the Blockchain, we were able to link 125 unique users to 20 hidden services, including sensitive ones, such as The Pirate Bay and Silk Road. We also analyzed two case studies in detail to demonstrate the implications of the information leakage on users anonymity. In particular, we confirm that Bitcoin addresses should be considered exploitable, as they can be used to deanonymize users retroactively. This is especially important for Tor hidden service users who actively seek and expect privacy and anonymity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The model is estimated using daily bitcoin price data from 2013 until 2020 whereby three types of agents are considered: mean-variance optimizers, speculators and fundamentalists, respectively. While mean-variance optimizers trade on the basis of conditional first and second moments of the return distribution, speculators engage in trend chasing and buy when prices are rising and sell when prices are declining. Fundamentalists trade on the basis of fundamental factors that can impact the value of bitcoin. The fractions of agents engaging in one strategy over another shows statistically substantial variation during high and low bitcoin price volatility regimes. Estimation results reveal the following. First, unlike in traditional asset classes, there is evidence of mean-variance optimizers. Second, there is evidence of speculators who engage in 'bandwagon behavior' and buy bitcoins during price appreciations and sell bitcoins during price declines. Finally, there is evidence of fundamentalists who trade bitcoins when fundamental factors deviate from their long-run trends. Remarkably, these fundamentalists exhibit contrarian-type behaviors during low price volatility regimes while behaving more like fundamental traders during high price volatility regimes.","[Koutmos, Dimitrios] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Business Law, Coll Business, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA; [Payne, James E.] Univ Texas El Paso, Coll Business Adm, El Paso, TX 79968 USA","Texas A&M University System; University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso","Koutmos, D (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Business Law, Coll Business, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA.","dimitrios.koutmos@tamucc.edu; jpayne2@utep.edu","","","","","","","46","4","4","0","2","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0924-865X","1573-7179","","REV QUANT FINANC ACC","Rev.

Payment channels relieve the blockchain by allowing parties to execute transactions off-chain while maintaining the on-chain security guarantees, i.e., no party can be cheated out of their funds. However, to maintain these guarantees all parties must follow blockchain updates ardently. To alleviate this issue, a channel party can hire a watchtower to periodically check the blockchain for fraud on its behalf. However, watchtowers will only do their job properly if there are financial incentives, fees, and punishments. There are known solutions, but these need complex smart contracts, and as such are not applicable to Bitcoin's simple script language. This raises the natural question of whether incentivized watchtowers are at all possible in a system like Bitcoin. In this work, we answer this question affirmatively, by introducing Cerberus channels, an extension of Lightning channels. Cerberus channels reward watchtowers while remaining secure against bribing and collusion; thus participants can safely go offline for an extended period of time. We show that Cerberus channels are correct, and provide a proof-of-concept implementation in the Bitcoin script language.","[Avarikioti, Zeta; Wattenhofer, Roger] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Litos, Orfeas Stefanos Thyfronitis] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Edinburgh","Litos, OST (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.","o.thyfronitis@ed.ac.uk","","","","","","","16","7","7","2","5","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-51280-4; 978-3-030-51279-8","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2020","12059","","","","","","346","366","","10.1007/978-3-030-51280-4_19","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51280-4_19","","","21","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS3NK","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000713581800018","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Numerous studies have studied the accuracy of models from a set of factors. Hence, previous literature shows how models for the prediction of Bitcoin suffer from poor performance capacity and, therefore, more progress is needed on predictive models, and they do not select the most significant variables. This paper presents a comparison of deep learning methodologies for forecasting Bitcoin price and, therefore, a new prediction model with the ability to estimate accurately. A sample of 29 initial factors was used, which has made possible the application of explanatory factors of different aspects related to the formation of the price of Bitcoin. To the sample under study, different methods have been applied to achieve a robust model, namely, deep recurrent convolutional neural networks, which have shown the importance of transaction costs and difficulty in Bitcoin price, among others. Our results have a great potential impact on the adequacy of asset pricing against the uncertainties derived from digital currencies, providing tools that help to achieve stability in cryptocurrency markets. Our models offer high and stable success results for a future prediction horizon, something useful for asset valuation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.","[Lamothe-Fernandez, Prosper] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Financing & Commercial Res, UDI Financing, Calle Francisco Tomas y Valiente 5, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Alaminos, David] Univ Malaga, Dept Econ Theory & Econ Hist, Campus El Ejido S-N, Malaga 29071, Spain; [Lamothe-Lopez, Prosper] Rho Finanzas, Calle Zorrilla 21, Madrid 28014, Spain; [Fernandez-Gamez, Manuel A.] Univ Malaga, Dept Finance & Accounting, Campus El Ejido S-N, Malaga 29071, Spain","Autonomous University of Madrid; Universidad de Malaga; Universidad de Malaga","Alaminos, D (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, Dept Econ Theory & Econ Hist, Campus El Ejido S-N, Malaga 29071, Spain.","prosper.lamothe@uam.es; mangel@uma.es; pll@rhofinanzas.com; alaminos@uma.es","","Alaminos, David/0000-0002-2846-5104","Catedra de Economia y Finanzas Sostenibles, University of Malaga, Spain","Catedra de Economia y Finanzas Sostenibles, University of Malaga, Spain","This research was funded by Catedra de Economia y Finanzas Sostenibles, University of Malaga, Spain.","","33","19","19","4","36","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-7390","","MATHEMATICS-BASEL","Mathematics","AUG","2020","8","8","","","","","","","1245","10.3390/math8081245","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math8081245","","","13","Mathematics","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Mathematics","NL2ZD","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000567289000001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this paper, a secure and privacy-preserving mix service for Bitcoin anonymity, Lockmix, is proposed. Lockmix introduces mix servers to provide a mix service for the user by using blind signature and multi-signature schemes to prevent attackers from linking the input address with the output address.

While millions of individuals invest in bitcoin, their motivations for doing so are less clear than with traditional investment decisions. We argue that the technical nature of bitcoin investments gives it unique characteristics and, consequently, that we lack a thorough understanding of how this affects the motivations behind bitcoin investment. We use a mixed method approach consisting of qualitative (n = 73) and quantitative (n = 150) studies and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify seven bitcoin-specific motivations (profit expectancy, ease of bitcoin acquisition, support of bitcoin ideology, investment skills, risk affinity, anticipated and experienced inaction regret) and how configurations of them explain bitcoin investment. The findings reveal, among others, that some individuals invest in bitcoin because they support the bitcoin ideology. Contrary to the traditional investment literature, profit expectancy is not a necessary condition to the extent that there is one empirical configuration of motivations that explains that individuals also invest in bitcoin even if they do not expect profits. The results disclose non-trivial investment motivation configurations and lay the groundwork for future studies of the role of cryptocurrencies in society.","[Mattke, Jens; Maier, Christian; Reis, Lea; Weitzel, Tim] Univ Bamberg, Informat Syst & Serv, Bamberg, Germany","Otto Friedrich University Bamberg","Mattke, J (corresponding author), Univ Bamberg, Informat Syst & Serv, Bamberg, Germany.","jens.mattke@uni-bamberg.de","Weitzel, Tim/AFS-7648-2022","Reis, Lea/0000-0002-6607-0517","","","","","98","34","34","15","84","TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0960-085X","1476-9344","","EUR J INFORM SYST","Eur.

For this purpose, we have performed the bootstrap full, and the sub-sample rolling-window Granger causality tests, in order to explore the mutual influences between geopolitical risks (GPR) and Bitcoin prices (BCP). We have found that there are positive and negative influences that stem from GPR towards BCP. In this regard, the positive impacts ascertain that the Bitcoin currency can be considered as an asset that is developed in order to avoid GPR. However, this view cannot be held constant and absolute, without considering the negative effects of such an arrangement. Moreover, it is noteworthy that these results are not supported by the Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM), which highlights that BCP can be positively affected by GPR. On the flipside, there is a positive influence extended from BCP towards GPR, which suggests that the Bitcoin market is a leading indicator that can be used to analyze the global geopolitical environment more accurately and comprehensively. Therefore, in situations involving severe global uncertainty and complicated geopolitical patterns, investors can benefit from the Bitcoin market in order to optimize their investments during the periods where the GPR are higher. Moreover, governments can also adopt, accept and boost the trend of BCP by considering valid GPR, and further promote the advances in encryption technology. They can also strengthen their supervision, in order to promote a healthy development of the Bitcoin market, which in turn is a significant indicator of the macroeconomic and political trends across the globe.","[Su, Chi-Wei] Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Qin, Meng] Natl Acad Governance, Grad Acad, Party Sch, Cent Comm Communist Party China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Tao, Ran] Qingdao Municipal Ctr Dis Control & Preventat, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Shao, Xue-Feng] Univ Sydney, Discipline Int Business, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Albu, Lucian Liviu] Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania; [Umar, Muhammad] Qingdao Univ, Sch Business, Qingdao, Peoples R China","Qingdao University; University of Sydney; Romanian Academy of Sciences; Qingdao University","Qin, M (corresponding author), Natl Acad Governance, Grad Acad, Party Sch, Cent Comm Communist Party China, Beijing, Peoples R China.","","Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021; Umar, Muhammad/AFG-9168-2022; Albu, Lucian Liviu/C-4524-2011; Albu, Lucian-Liviu/N-1468-2014","Umar, Muhammad/0000-0001-5773-5954; Albu, Lucian-Liviu/0000-0001-8097-227X; Shao, Xuefeng/0000-0002-4267-9600; Shao, Xuefeng/0000-0002-1278-8398","","","","","65","69","69","6","35","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","0040-1625","1873-5509","","TECHNOL FORECAST SOC","Technol.

Money has started to be perceived as a consumable service with multiple providers from which to choose. In such an environment, the question of how people consume money-instead of how they consume with money-grows in importance. This article is based on ethnographic research of Bitcoin communities in Prague and Bratislava. It examines how users variously consume Bitcoin and what consequences these diverse ways of consumption can have for the Bitcoin economy. The article identifies two discrete spheres of consumption that closely correlate with transactional orders or spheres of exchange as described in classical works of economic anthropology, for example, by Parry and Bloch. One of the spheres is concerned with the reproduction of social order, while the other considers the personal gain of individual consumers. The article also examines the tension between these two spheres and how it is dialectically resolved through strategies of conversion. In the final discussion, the case of Bitcoin is compared with other anthropological accounts of spheres of exchange, with special attention oriented to their dissimilarities.","[Tremcinsky, Martin] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Prague, Czech Republic","Charles University Prague","Tremcinsky, M (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Prague, Czech Republic.","martin.tremcinsky@fsv.cuni.cz","","","Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology; Charles University, project GA UK [1298119]","Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology(Max Planck Society); Charles University, project GA UK","The research was supported by Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology and by Charles University, project GA UK 1298119.","","36","1","1","1","6","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA","2330-4847","","","ECON ANTHROPOL","Econ.

LN is comprised of many payment channels forming a payment channel network. LN's promise is that relatively few payment channels already enable anyone to efficiently, securely and privately route payments across the whole network.

Further, to study the relationship between Bitcoin trading volume, volatility and returns, and the asymmetry in response to economic information for the period from July 2010 to November 2017. Design/methodology/approach Comparison of Bitcoin price volatility with that of six currencies and gold. We repeat the analysis using returns divided by volume. We examine the relationship between volume, returns and volatility, and the asymmetry of the reaction of the volatility to economic news using asymmetric models (EGARCH) run for four meaningful distinct time periods/subsamples. Findings Positive and significant relationship between (1) volume and volatility after 2013 (year Bitcoin became popular) and (2) volume and returns before the Mt. Gox hack. During the euphoric period, starting at the beginning of 2013 until the Mt. Gox hack, unexpected increases in Bitcoin returns increased Bitcoin volatility more than unexpected, equally sized decreases (asymmetry). Originality/value We take into consideration the volume of trades to show that Bitcoin volatility seems high because of the low volume of trades. We study an extended time period, not covered by other studies. We divide our sample into four meaningful time periods based on important events in Bitcoin market history. This is important for a new market such as the Bitcoin market; the relationships under study are very important in markets where participants rely on technical analysis in the absence of reliable fundamental methodology to measure the intrinsic value of the asset.","[Sapuric, Svetlana; Kokkinaki, Angelika; Georgiou, Ifigenia] Univ Nicosia, Sch Business, Nicosia, Cyprus","University of Nicosia","Georgiou, I (corresponding author), Univ Nicosia, Sch Business, Nicosia, Cyprus.","sapuric.s@unic.ac.cy; kokkinaki.a@unic.ac.cy; georgiou.i@unic.ac.cy","","","","","","","37","3","3","1","5","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1741-0398","1758-7409","","J ENTERP INF MANAG","J.

Here we test Bitcoin for a set of these stylized facts. First we study the tails of the distribution of returns for Bitcoin and show that they are fat and exhibit aggregational Gaussianity. We then show that the volatility of Bitcoin tends to cluster in time. Also, the correlation between the volume and volatility is always positive, and the long range variance of returns predict the fine structure better than the other way around. In the second part of this work we show per analogiam that Bitcoin mimics a set of naturally occurring phenomena. For instance, the volatility observed in Bitcoin follows both the Omori and Gutenberg-Richter laws. Finally, we show that the global persistence, originally defined for spin systems, presents a power law behavior with exponent similar to that found in traditional financial markets.

Since the introduction of bitcoin in 2008, emphasis has focused on economists, policy-makers and analysts drastically increasing bitcoin's accessibility and commodity values (Dumitrescu & Firica, 2014). This study employs GARCH and EGARCH from ARCH/GARCH family on daily nature data. We measure the volatile behavior of bitcoin by employing auto-regressive conditional heteroscedasticity model with the aim to explore the relationship between major commodities and bitcoin volatility. We focus on major commodities like gold, silver, platinum, and crude oil to be regressed with bitcoin. The daily prices of commodities were retrieved from www.investing.com and bitcoin prices from www.coindesk.com for the period from 29 April 2013 to 16 October 2018. Results confirmed the currency's long-term volatile behavior, which is due to its composition and market dynamics, whereas the existence of asynunetric information effect is not confirmed. Tax recognition by other countries may in future help in controlling the volatility as bitcoin is not a country-specific security. But, only silver impacts on volatility in comparison to oil prices and platinum, which is due to its similar features with gold. Eventually, bitcoin can be used for risk diversification and money making.","[Jalal, Raja Nabeel-Ud-Din] Univ GdA Chieti Pescara, Dipartmento Econ Aziendale, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65127 Pescara, Italy; [Sargiacomo, Massimo] Univ GdA Chieti Pescara, Dipartmento Econ Aziendale, Accounting, Pescara, Italy; [Sahar, Najam Us] Riphah Int Univ, FMS, Finance, Islamabad, Pakistan","","Jalal, RNUD (corresponding author), Univ GdA Chieti Pescara, Dipartmento Econ Aziendale, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65127 Pescara, Italy.","nabeel.jalal@unich.it; msargiacomo@unich.it; Najam.sahar@riphah.edu.pk","Jalal, Raja Nabeel-Ud-Din/AAL-4347-2020","Jalal, Raja Nabeel-Ud-Din/0000-0002-1311-1418; Sahar, Najam Us/0000-0002-1898-1543","","","","","46","7","8","2","8","KOREA DISTRIBUTION SCIENCE ASSOC","GYEONGGI","HANSHIN OFFICETEL STE 1030, 2463-4, SHINHEUNG-DONG SUJEONG-GU, SEONGNAM, GYEONGGI, 461-713, SOUTH KOREA","2288-4637","2288-4645","","J ASIAN FINANC ECON","J.

In recent years, the Bitcoin network has attracted investors, businesses, and corporations while facilitating services and product deals. Moreover, Bitcoin has made itself the dominant source of decentralized cryptocurrency. While considerable research has been done concerning Bitcoin network analysis, limited research has been conducted on predicting the Bitcoin price. The purpose of this study is to predict the price of Bitcoin and changes therein using the grey system theory. The first order grey model (GM (1,1)) is used for this purpose. It uses a first-order differential equation to model the trend of time series. The results show that the GM (1,1) model predicts Bitcoin's price accurately and that one can earn a maximum profit confidence level of approximately 98% by choosing the appropriate time frame and by managing investment assets.","[Jalali, Mahboubeh Faghih Mohammadi; Heidari, Hanif] Damghan Univ, Dept Appl Math, Damghan, Iran","","Heidari, H (corresponding author), Damghan Univ, Dept Appl Math, Damghan, Iran.","heidari@du.ac.ir","Heidari, Hanif/ABC-5262-2021","Heidari, Hanif/0000-0002-6321-3295","","","","","53","21","21","12","25","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","2199-4730","","FINANC INNOV","Financ.

One of the main stream of investigation is the identification of relevant factors affecting its returns and volatility; empirical evidence suggests a positive association between returns and sentiment proxies about the Bitcoin network, such as Wikipedia inquiries, internet search intensity on the topic, trading volume in main exchanges or sentiment measures obtained via natural language processing algorithms applied on specialized forums comments or social media posts on the theme. In this paper we investigate the association of trading volume and internet search intensity with Bitcoin returns and volatility, complementing the outcomes in Figa-Talamanca and Patacca (Decis Econ Fin ISSN: 1129-6569, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10203-01900258-7, 2019) and Urquhart (Econ Lett 166:40-44, ISSN: 0165-1765, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2018.02.017, 2018): we find no direct relationship between the two market attention measures and returns while both the trading volume and the internet search intensity affect positively Bitcoin volatility. Conversely, an increase in Bitcoin returns does increase both trading volume and internet search intensity, evidencing an inverse relationship between returns and attention measures. As a byproduct, we also detect a positive association between trading volume and the internet search intensity and no reverse relationship. Since market attention, especially internet search volume, do increase around relevant events and corresponding news or announcements for the Bitcoin market, we also analyze whether and to which extent the above relationships change, after specific events are taken into account. Indeed, by applying two different approaches, we show that the relationships may change significantly.","[Figa-Talamanca, Gianna] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy; [Patacca, Marco] Leonard de Vinci Pole Univ, Res Ctr, F-92916 Paris, France","University of Perugia","Figa-Talamanca, G (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.","gianna.figatalamanca@unipg.it; marco.patacca@devinci.fr","Patacca, Marco/AAF-2059-2019","Patacca, Marco/0000-0003-3242-429X","Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Perugia [2018.0247.021]; FRB Grant from University of Perugia (FRB 2018)","Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Perugia(Fondazione Cassa Risparmio Perugia); FRB Grant from University of Perugia (FRB 2018)","The authors wish to thank the participants of EURO 2018 and iCare 2018 Conferences, especially Carol Alexander and Dmitri Vinogradov, for interesting discussion on the topics of the paper and the anonymous reviewer whose comments and suggestions helped to substantially improve the paper.

However, security and anonymity problems exist with Bitcoin, which threaten vulnerable IoT facilities. This paper aims to achieve conditional anonymity inside Bitcoin transactions. We first propose an identity-based conditionally anonymous signature (ICAS) algorithm and then design a lightweight Bitcoin script scheme (named pay-to-public-key-hash-with-conditional-anonymity or P2PKHCA), which applies the ICAS algorithm to make conditionally anonymous Bitcoin transactions. P2PKHCA allows the identity manager to trace the real identity of users while preserving users anonymity. Furthermore, P2PKHCA is backward compatible in terms of being able to work seamlessly with the existing Bitcoin script scheme pay-to-public-key-hash (P2PKH) in the Bitcoin network. We conduct a security analysis to verify the security features of P2PKHCA and employ a performance evaluation in terms of the cryptographic time and space costs by comparison with P2PKH. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of P2PKHCA in reducing both time cost and data size. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In the real world, businesses take time off, particularly on weekends. This is no different in the crypto-asset world, which, theoretically, is operable 24/7. We also performed a threshold analysis of the flow of bitcoin to identify the big wallets and to compare it with the identity of real-world crypto-exchange companies, in particular, their weekly patterns. Finally, we propose a methodology to identify the financial institution in the bitcoin blockchain on the basis of fulfilling some key criteria. The criteria are having high frequency, appearing persistently on daily big trades and showing a distinct weekly pattern of total average network flow.","[Islam, Rubaiyat; Fujiwara, Yoshi; Kawata, Shinya] Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Simulat Studies, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Yoon, Hiwon] CMD Lab Inc., Tokyo 1510051, Japan; [Kawata, Shinya] SCIO THINK LLC, Tokyo 1710022, Japan","University of Hyogo","Islam, R (corresponding author), Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Simulat Studies, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan.","rubaiyat.islam1982@gmail.com","","Islam, Rubaiyat/0000-0003-4024-6462","Nomura Foundation; JSPS KAKENHI [17H02041, 19K22032]; Kyoto University; Ripple's collaboration scheme","Nomura Foundation; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Kyoto University; Ripple's collaboration scheme","We would like to thank Hideaki Aoyama, Yuichi Ikeda, and Naoyuki Iwashita in Kyoto University for our useful discussions.

To do this, we consider a vector error correction model over two overlapping periods: 2010-17 and 2010-19. Price discovery is achieved through the Gonzalo-Granger permanent-transitory decomposition. The pricing factors are endogenous linear combinations of the S&P 500 index, gold price, a Google search variable associated to Bitcoin and a fear index proxied by the FED Financial Stress Index. Our empirical analysis shows that during the first period, a linear combination of four pricing factors describes the efficient Bitcoin price. The S&P 500 index and Google searches have a positive effect whereas gold prices and the fear index have a negative effect. In contrast, during the second period, the efficient price behaves idiosyncratically and can be only rationalised by individuals' search for information on the cryptocurrency. These findings provide empirical evidence on the presence of a correction in Bitcoin prices during the period 2018-19 uncorrelated to market fundamentals. We also show that standard empirical asset pricing models perform poorly for explaining Bitcoin prices.","[Kapar, Burcu] Amer Univ Dubai, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Olmo, Jose] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Zaragoza, Spain; [Olmo, Jose] Univ Southampton, Dept Econ, Southampton, Hants, England","American University in Dubai (AUD); University of Zaragoza; University of Southampton","Olmo, J (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Zaragoza, Spain.;Olmo, J (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Dept Econ, Southampton, Hants, England.","joseolmo@unizar.es","kapar, burcu/AAD-4062-2022","kapar, burcu/0000-0002-1557-4723; Olmo, Jose/0000-0002-0437-7812","","","","","41","11","11","5","24","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0378-5920","1467-9701","","WORLD ECON","World Econ.","JAN","2021","44","1","","","","","45","63","","10.1111/twec.13020","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/twec.13020","","SEP 2020","19","Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Business & Economics; International Relations","PN1RN","","Green Accepted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000567795000001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, shortening the block generation interval or increasing the block size to improve throughput makes it sharing blocks within the network slower and increases the number of orphan blocks. Consequently, the security of the blockchain is sacrificed. To mitigate this, it is necessary to reduce the block propagation delay. Because of the contribution of new Bitcoin protocols and the improvements of the Internet, the block propagation delay in the Bitcoin network has been shortened in recent years. In this study, we identify impacts of compact block relay-an up-to-date Bitcoin protocol-and Internet improvement on the block propagation delay and fork rate in the Bitcoin network from 2015 to 2019. Existing measurement studies could not identify them but our simulation enables it. The experimental results reveal that compact block relay contributes to shortening the block propagation delay more than Internet improvements. The block propagation delay is reduced by 64.5% for the 50th percentile and 63.7% for the 90th percentile due to Internet improvements, and by 90.1% for the 50th percentile and by 87.6% for the 90th percentile due to compact block relay.","[Nagayama, Ryunosuke; Banno, Ryohei; Shudo, Kazuyuki] Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan","Tokyo Institute of Technology","Nagayama, R (corresponding author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan.","nagayama.r.ac@m.titech.ac.jp","Banno, Ryohei/AAB-9445-2019","Banno, Ryohei/0000-0001-7268-4657","SECOM Science and Technology Foundation","SECOM Science and Technology Foundation","This work was supported by SECOM Science and Technology Foundation.","","9","7","7","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1530-1346","","978-1-7281-8086-1","IEEE SYMP COMP COMMU","","","2020","","","","","","","506","510","","","","","","5","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BR4RM","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000652570900080","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The models used include the augmented Dickey-Fuller test, Akaike Information Criteria, autocorrelation function and exchange rate changes determining which currency is the most volatile. Findings The findings indicate, based on the statistical measures used, including the standard deviation of selected currencies and annualized volatility, that Litecoin is more volatile than Bitcoin and the Euro and that Bitcoin is more volatile than the Euro. This furthers previous research on cryptocurrency volatility. Originality/value The paper provides compelling evidence about the volatility of Litecoin and Bitcoin. The volatility of cryptocurrencies is furthered with data that are more current.

Anomaly detection of Bitcoin has become a problem that must be solved. The existing Bitcoin anomaly detection methods only use static network models, and only the simple structural features such as node attributes and in/out-degree are considered to measure the similarities between nodes. Therefore, we propose a series of constrained anomaly detection algorithms for Bitcoin data. In our algorithms, we first construct a temporal Bitcoin network model for Bitcoin data. Then, combining time constraints, attribute constraints and structure constraints, a multi-constrained meta path is proposed on the basis of the meta path to specify the candidate sets, reference sets and similarity measurement strategies and detect local abnormal users and transactions that are of interest to users from static and dynamic angles with lower space-time overhead. Experiments on realworld Bitcoin data show that the constrained algorithms have certain improvements in recall, precision and F2 score when compared to the algorithms that only considers simple structural features such as node attributes and in/out-degree.","[Zhang, Rui; Zhang, Guifa] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Hubei Key Lab Transportat Internet Things, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Lan] Cent China Normal Univ, Natl Engn Lab Educ Big Data, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chen] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Internet Technol & Engn R&D Ctr ITEC, Sch Elect Informat & Commun, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Wan, Shaohua] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Informat & Safety Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Wan, Shaohua] Nanjing Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Novel Software Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China","Wuhan University of Technology; Central China Normal University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law; Nanjing University","Wan, SH (corresponding author), Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Informat & Safety Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R China.;Wan, SH (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Novel Software Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China.","zhangrui@whut.edu.cn; gfzhang@whut.edu.cn; lanliu@mail.ccnu.edu.cn; chenwang@hust.edu.cn; shaohua.wan@ieee.org","Wang, Chen/E-3121-2010; Wan, Shaohua/B-9243-2014","Wang, Chen/0000-0003-1963-4954; Wan, Shaohua/0000-0001-7013-9081","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61872416, 61702204, 61671216, 61871436, 51479159, 51879210, 61872415]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [2019kfyXJJS017]; Open Research Project of Hubei Key Laboratory of Intelligent Geo-Information Processing [KLIGIP-2018A03]; Open Project of State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology [KFKT2019B17]; fund of Hubei Key Laboratory of Transportation Internet of Things [2018IOT004, 2019IOT004]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Open Research Project of Hubei Key Laboratory of Intelligent Geo-Information Processing; Open Project of State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology; fund of Hubei Key Laboratory of Transportation Internet of Things","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 61872416, 61702204, 61671216, 61871436, 51479159, 51879210, 51879210 and 61872415; by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China under Grant 2019kfyXJJS017; by the Open Research Project of Hubei Key Laboratory of Intelligent Geo-Information Processing under Grant KLIGIP-2018A03, by the Open Project of State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology (no.

However, these ground-truth datasets are frequently affected by significant class imbalance as generally they contain much more information regarding legal services (Exchange, Gambling), than regarding services that may be related to illicit activities (Mixer, Service). Class imbalance increases the complexity of applying machine learning techniques and reduces the quality of classification results, especially for underrepresented, but critical classes. In this paper, we propose to address this problem by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Bitcoin data augmentation as GANs recently have shown promising results in the domain of image classification. However, there is no one-fits-all GAN solution that works for every scenario. In fact, setting GAN training parameters is non-trivial and heavily affects the quality of the generated synthetic data. We therefore evaluate how GAN parameters such as the optimization function, the size of the dataset and the chosen batch size affect GAN implementation for one underrepresented entity class (Mining Pool) and demonstrate how a good GAN configuration can be obtained that achieves high similarity between synthetically generated and real Bitcoin address data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study presenting GANs as a valid tool for generating synthetic address data for data augmentation in Bitcoin entity classification.","[Zola, Francesco; Lukas Bruse, Jan; Etxeberria Barrio, Xabier; Orduna Urrutia, Raul] Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Vicomtech Fundat, Donostia San Sebastian, Spain; [Galar, Mikel] Univ Publ Navarra, Inst Smart Cities, Pamplona, Spain","Universidad Publica de Navarra","Zola, F (corresponding author), Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Vicomtech Fundat, Donostia San Sebastian, Spain.","fzola@vicomtech.org; jbruse@vicomtech.org; xetxeberria@vicomtech.org; mikel.galar@unavarra.es; roduna@vicomtech.org","","Echeberria, Xabier/0000-0001-6836-2890; Bruse, Jan L/0000-0002-5774-1593; Zola, Francesco/0000-0002-1733-5515; Orduna-Urrutia, Raul/0000-0002-5932-0987","European Commission through the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, as part of the TITANIUM project [740558]","European Commission through the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, as part of the TITANIUM project","This work was partially funded by the European Commission through the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, as part of the TITANIUM project (grant agreement No 740558).","","32","3","3","1","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-7091-6","","","","2020","","","","","","","136","143","","","","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7IF","","Green Submitted, Green Accepted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000848737000027","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Inspired by the movement that tail behavior is the key feature to determine the property of asset and for market participants to perceive the asset, I compare the tail behavior of daily return on Bitcoin to that of daily return on the US dollar, gold and the stock market index. Based on the conditional autoregressive Value at Risk proposed by Engle and Manganelli (2004), I find the similarity of the tail behavior between Bitcoin and the dollar, the stock market index with respect to contemporaneous correlation. Additionally, the tail of stock market return turns out to be associated with the risk premium on Bitcoin's return while Bitcoin is proved to be the element of the time-varying investment opportunity set on the basis of Merton's (1973) ICAPM setting. These findings suggest that Bitcoin is traded as an alternative for a medium of exchange and a means of investment, being far from a commodity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We first examine the dynamic spillovers between Bitcoin and 12 developed equities, gold, and crude oil for different market conditions using a Bayesian Time-Varying Parameter Vector Autoregressive (TVP-VAR) model with daily spot prices. Our econometric approach enables us to capture the left and right tails as well as the shoulders of the return distribution corresponding to volatility spillovers under the bear, normal, and bull market states among these financial assets. We quantify and trace the dependence and directional predictability from Bitcoin to other assets using the sample cross-quantilogram. Our key findings offer convincing evidence of time variation in the level of volatility. Spillovers between Bitcoin and other financial assets intensify during extreme global market conditions. Secondly, results from the cross-quantilogram indicate strong dependence and positive directional predictability between Bitcoin and most equities and crude oil when market returns are bullish. However, during the bearish market period, there is negative dependence and predictability from Bitcoin to stocks in Finland, the Netherlands, the U.S.A, and the crude oil market only. This implies that Bitcoin can act as a hedge to stocks in Finland, the Netherlands, the U.S.A, and the crude oil market. However, insignificant dependence and directional predictability from Bitcoin to the remaining assets indicate that Bitcoin may act as a safe-haven to these assets during bearish markets. Our findings hold important implications for both international investors and portfolio managers who consider Bitcoin as part of their portfolio diversification and other investment strategies.","[Urom, Christian; Guesmi, Khaled] Paris Sch Business, Ctr Res Energy & Climate Change CRECC, Paris, France; [Abid, Ilyes] ISC Paris Business Sch, Paris, France; [Chevallier, Julien] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, 184 Bd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France; [Chevallier, Julien] Univ Paris 8 LED, 2 Rue Liberte, F-93526 St Denis, France","IPAG Business School","Chevallier, J (corresponding author), Univ Paris 8 LED, 2 Rue Liberte, F-93526 St Denis, France.","julien.chevallier@ipag.fr","","","","","","","73","27","27","3","48","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0264-9993","1873-6122","","ECON MODEL","Econ.

Our dataset is at the daily frequency and covers the period 30 April 2013 to 31 October 2019.

Mining pools, the main components of the Bitcoin network, dominate the computing resources, and play essential roles in network security and performance aspects. Although many existing measurements of the Bitcoin network are available, little is known about the details of mining pool behaviors (e.g., mining revenue and transaction collection strategy) and their effects on the Bitcoin end users (e.g., transaction fees, transaction delay, and transaction acceptance rate). This paper aims to fill this gap with a systematic study of mining pools. We traced over 2.15 hundred thousand blocks from February 2016 to February 2020 and collected over 4.12 TB unconfirmed transactions. Then we conducted a board range of measurements on the pool evolutions, labeled transactions (blocks) as well as real-time network traffics, and discovered new interesting observations and features. Specifically, our measurements showed the following. 1) A few mining pools continuously controlled most of the computing resources of the Bitcoin network. 2) Mining pools were caught in a prisoner's dilemma where mining pools compete to increase their computing resources even though the unit profit of the computing resource decreases. 3) Mining pools were stuck in a Malthusian trap where there is a stage at which the Bitcoin incentives are inadequate for feeding the exponential growth of the computing resources. 4) The market price and transaction fees were not sensitive to the past events of halving block rewards. 5) Feerate played a dominating role in the transaction collection strategy for the top mining pools. Our measurements and analysis helped the Bitcoin community to understand and improve the Bitcoin network.","[Wang, Canhui; Chu, Xiaowen] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Qin, Yang] Harbin Inst Technol Shenzhen, Dept Comp Sci, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","Hong Kong Baptist University; Harbin Institute of Technology","Chu, XW (corresponding author), Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","chwang@comp.hkbu.edu.hk; chxw@comp.hkbu.edu.hk; csyqin@hitsz.edu.cn","","Chu, Xiaowen/0000-0001-9745-4372","","","","","40","11","11","2","6","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-8275-9","","","","2020","","","","","","","180","188","","10.1109/BigCom51056.2020.00032","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BigCom51056.2020.00032","","","9","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BQ8TW","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000621654000025","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The paper's motivation is based upon the idea that bitcoin can be similar to gold in terms of its hedging properties and can be used for hedging for different assets. Moreover, although it is more metaphorical, bitcoin is also accepted because it is mined like crude oil, namely, a commodity. These similarities can be investigated by analyzing the connectedness among these financial assets. The connectedness results derived from both total connectedness and frequency connectedness methods indicate that volatility connectedness is higher than the return connectedness among these assets. Furthermore, connectedness in volatilities is mostly driven by medium frequency, although connectedness in returns mostly exists in high frequency. Therefore, these results suggest that investors should consider these financial assets for their diversification decisions. The results suggest that although diversification among these three assets is more difficult in the short- and medium-term, investors may benefit from diversification in the long-run.","[Ozturk, Serda Selin] Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34060 Istanbul, Turkey","Istanbul Bilgi University","Ozturk, SS (corresponding author), Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34060 Istanbul, Turkey.","serda.ozturk@bilgi.edu.tr","","Ozturk, Serda Selin/0000-0003-2758-9321","","","","","38","7","7","2","5","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

Botnets benefited from this rise to increase their size and the magnitude of their attacks. However, they still have a weak point in their Command & Control (C&C) system, which is often based on centralized services or require a complex infrastructure to keep operating without being taken down by authorities. The recent spread of blockchain technologies may give botnets a powerful tool to make them very hard to disrupt. Recent research showed how it is possible to embed C&C messages in Bitcoin transactions, making them nearly impossible to block. Nevertheless, transactions have a cost and allow very limited amounts of data to be transmitted. Because of that, only messages from the botmaster to the bots are sent via Bitcoin, while bots are assumed to communicate through external channels. Furthermore, for the same reason, Bitcoin-based messages are sent in clear. In this paper we show how, using Bitcoin Testnet, it is possible to overcome these limitations and implement a cost-free, bidirectional, and encrypted C&C channel between the botmaster and the bots. We propose a communication protocol and analyze its viability in real life. Our results show that this approach would enable a botmaster to build a robust and hard-to-disrupt C&C system at virtually no cost, thus representing a realistic threat for which countermeasures should be devised.","[Franzoni, Federico; Abellan, Ivan; Daza, Vanesa] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain","Pompeu Fabra University","Franzoni, F (corresponding author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.","federico.franzoni@upf.edu; iabellan@pm.me; vanesa.daza@upf.edu","","Abellan Alvarez, Ivan/0000-0003-4670-433X; Franzoni, FEDERICO/0000-0001-6697-5431; Daza, Vanesa/0000-0003-0583-7929","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under the Maria de Maeztu Units of Excellence Programme [MDM-2015-0502, RTI2018-102112-B-I00]","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under the Maria de Maeztu Units of Excellence Programme(Spanish Government)","F.

Nonetheless, they are a relevant part of the network and play an essential role in the propagation of messages. In this paper, we focus on transaction propagation and show that increasing the participation of unreachable nodes can potentially improve the robustness and efficiency of the network. In order to do that, we propose a few changes to the network protocol. Additionally, we design a novel transaction propagation protocol that explicitly involves unreachable nodes to provide better protection against deanonymization attacks. Our solutions are simple to implement and can effectively bring immediate benefits to the Bitcoin network.","[Franzoni, Federico; Daza, Vanesa] Univ Pompeu Fabra UPF, DTIC, Barcelona, Spain; [Daza, Vanesa] CYBERCAT Ctr Cybersecur Res Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain","Pompeu Fabra University","Franzoni, F (corresponding author), Univ Pompeu Fabra UPF, DTIC, Barcelona, Spain.","federico.franzoni@upf.edu; vanesa.daza@upf.edu","","","AEI/FEDER, UE [RTI2018-102112-B-I00]","AEI/FEDER, UE","The research leading to this article was partially supported by Project RTI2018-102112-B-I00 (AEI/FEDER, UE).","","34","2","2","0","0","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-0-7381-0495-9","","","","2020","","","","","","","196","203","","10.1109/Blockchain50366.2020.00031","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain50366.2020.00031","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR3LS","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000647642100023","View Full Record in Web of Science"

To this end, we propose a continuous time model for Bitcoin price motivated by the findings in recent literature on Bitcoin, showing that price changes are affected by sentiment and attention of investors, see e.g., (Kristoufek in Sci Rep 3:3415,2013, PLoS ONE 10(4):e0123923,2015; Bukovina and Marticek in Sentiment and bitcoin volatility. Technical report, Mendel University in Brno, Faculty of Business and Economics2016). Economic studies, such as Yermack (Handbook of Digital Currency, chapter second. Elsevier, Amsterdam, pp 31-43,2015), have also classified Bitcoin as a speculative asset rather than a currency due to its high volatility. Building on these outcomes, the price dynamics in our suggestion is indeed affected by an exogenous factor which represents market attention in the Bitcoin system. We prove the model to be arbitrage-free under a mild condition and we fit the model to historical data for the Bitcoin price; after obtaining a approximate formula for the likelihood, parameter values are estimated by means of the profile likelihood method. In addition, we derive a closed pricing formula for European-style derivatives on Bitcoin, the performance of which is assessed on a panel of market prices for Plain Vanilla options quoted on.","[Cretarola, Alessandra] Univ Perugia, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Via Luigi Vanvitelli 1, I-06123 Perugia, Italy; [Figa-Talamanca, Gianna; Patacca, Marco] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via Alessandro Pascoli, I-06123 Perugia, Italy; [Patacca, Marco] Leonard da Vinci Pole Univ, Res Ctr, F-92916 Paris, France","University of Perugia; University of Perugia","Cretarola, A (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Via Luigi Vanvitelli 1, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.","alessandra.cretarola@unipg.it; gianna.figatalamanca@unipg.it; marco.patacca@devinci.fr","Figa-Talamanca, Gianna/AAH-8196-2021; Patacca, Marco/AAF-2059-2019; Cretarola, Alessandra/L-1925-2015","Patacca, Marco/0000-0003-3242-429X; Cretarola, Alessandra/0000-0003-1324-9342","Bank of Italy [407660/16]; Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio Perugia [2015.0459013]","Bank of Italy; Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio Perugia(Fondazione Cassa Risparmio Perugia)","The first and the second-named authors are grateful to Bank of Italy and Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio Perugia for the financial support, through Project Numbers 407660/16 and 2015.0459013, respectively.","","40","12","12","0","9","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","1593-8883","1129-6569","","DECIS ECON FINANC","Decis.

Our results show that realized variance and its jump component exhibit similar dynamics and react similarly to various types of news. Volatility of bitcoin reacts most strongly to news on bitcoin regulation, positive investor sentiment regarding bitcoin regulation extracted using Google searches, and most notably, hacking attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges. Quantile regression reveals that hacking attacks have particularly strong impact on the upper conditional distribution of bitcoin volatility. We also find that the volatility of bitcoin is not influenced by most scheduled US macroeconomic news announcements, such as government budget deficits, inflation, or even monetary policy announcements.

This study applies the quantile regression approach for the 2010-2018 period. For robustness, this paper splits the whole sample period into two different subsamples: a more volatile and a less volatile sub-period. Moreover, to capture both long- and short-run asymmetries between Bitcoin and gold price returns, an asymmetric nonlinear cointegration approach (NARDL) is applied. The results evidence that the most relevant risk factor is the VIX index, followed by changes in the STLFSI stress index, and both show negative and statistically significant effects on Bitcoin returns in most periods and quantiles. The US stock market returns have statistically significant effects (with positive sign) on Bitcoin returns in all periods and specifically in high quantiles. Bitcoin returns show negative statistically significant sensitivity to changes in nominal interest rates in the highest quantile and the full period. Moreover, Bitcoin returns show negative and statistically significant sensitivity to oil returns at low quantiles, by serving as a safe-haven asset during economic turmoil. Therefore, in general, the sensitivity of Bitcoin returns to movements in international risk factors tends to be more pronounced in extreme market conditions (bullish and bearish scenarios), showing the highest explanatory power in the lowest quantile. Finally, we have applied the non-linear ARDL approach to analyse the long- and short-run relations between Bitcoin and gold price returns and have found a positive and statistically significant connectedness between them.","[Jareno, Francisco] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ & Finance, Plaza Univ 1, Albacete 02071, Spain; [Gonzalez, Maria de la O.; Tolentino, Marta; Sierra, Karen] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Ciudad Real, Spain","Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha","Jareno, F (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ & Finance, Plaza Univ 1, Albacete 02071, Spain.","francisco.jareno@uclm.es","Jareño, Francisco/AAO-8995-2020; Jareño, Francisco/L-7645-2014; GONZALEZ, MARIA DE LA O/E-6542-2017","Jareño, Francisco/0000-0001-9778-7345; Jareño, Francisco/0000-0001-9778-7345; GONZALEZ, MARIA DE LA O/0000-0003-0740-7965; Tolentino, Marta/0000-0002-2155-2408","Spanish Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad [ECO2017-89715-P]","Spanish Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad","This work was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad (ECO2017-89715-P).","","61","50","50","6","20","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0301-4207","1873-7641","","RESOUR POLICY","Resour.

This technology has the potential to solve the inherent scalability issue of the Bitcoin system, but is still questionable whether the proposed system is highly secure and robust against various cyberattacks. In this paper, we analyzed the network characteristics of the Lightning Network mainnet which was launched on March 15, 2018 and found that the Lightning Network topology shows strong scale-free network characteristics. This implies that Lightning Network can be vulnerable to DDoS attacks targeting some specific nodes in the network because there are a few highly connected hub'' nodes in a scale-free network. We experimentally analyze the robustness of Lightning Network via the simulation of network attack model. Our simulation results demonstrate that the connectivity of the existing Lightning Network cannot be maintained sufficiently against target attacks that repeatedly destroy a few nodes with high centrality.

The existing wallet signature schemes are improper for the organization hierarchy since the organization hierarchy requires each employee in the organization to sign independently and the upper management has to prove employee's signature before starting his signing which makes the scheme more realistic. This paper presents a practical signature scheme to organize the access of organization's bitcoin wallet. In the proposed scheme, organizations can create its own rules and manage wallet access without affecting transaction size. In addition, the proposed scheme can keep the structure of organization and manage employee hiring and termination.

In this paper, we estimate the lower bound for the global mining energy cost for a period of 10 years from 2010 to 2020, taking into account changes in energy costs, improvements in hashing technologies and hashing activity. We estimate energy cost for Bitcoin mining using two methods: Brent Crude oil prices as a global standard and regional industrial electricity prices weighted by the share of hashing activity. Despite a 10-billion-fold increase in hashing activity and a 10-million-fold increase in total energy consumption, we find the cost relative to the volume of transactions has not increased nor decreased since 2010. This is consistent with the perspective that, in order to keep the Blockchain system secure from double spending attacks, the proof or work must cost a sizable fraction of the value that can be transferred through the network. We estimate that in the Bitcoin network this fraction is of the order of 1%.","[Song, Yo-Der; Aste, Tomaso] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London, England; [Song, Yo-Der; Aste, Tomaso] UCL, UCL Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England","University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London","Aste, T (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London, England.;Aste, T (corresponding author), UCL, UCL Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England.","t.aste@ucl.ac.uk","","","ESRC [ES/K002309/1]; EPSRC [EP/P031730/1]; EC [H2020-ICT-2018-2 825215]","ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EC(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre)","TA acknowledges support from ESRC (ES/K002309/1), EPSRC (EP/P031730/1), and EC (H2020-ICT-2018-2 825215).

With a rapid increase in Bitcoin prices in the short term, more investors enthusiastically began investing in it, raising concerns about a speculative bubble. This study investigated the multiple factors involved in the Bitcoin craze despite concerns about its shortcomings. In what concerns to personality traits and psychological states, online use patterns, and investment patterns, we first hypothesized that Bitcoin investors would show differences in multiple factors when compared to share investors. Based on our assumptions about these differences, we secondly hypothesized that investors' personality, psychological states, and investment patterns could predict whether they would invest in Bitcoin or shares. In total, 307 respondents completed the research protocol and were sorted into Bitcoin investors (n = 101), share investors (n = 102), and non-investors (n = 104). A self-report questionnaire on demographic data, online use patterns, investment patterns as well as the Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) scale, Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised-Short (TCI-RS), Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ), trait anxiety part of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T), and the Korean version of the Canadian Problem Gambling Index (K-CPGI) were administered. The results of this study indicated that Bitcoin investments can be attributed to the interaction of multiple factors, among which personality, psychological states, and investment patterns are particularly important. Specifically, the investment pattern is the strongest predictive factor for Bitcoin investment. Bitcoin investors were distinct with regard to higher novelty seeking, higher gambling tendencies, and unique investment patterns. Thus, personality, psychological states, and investment patterns could explain the substantial investments in Bitcoin.","[Kim, Hee Jin; Hong, Ji Sun; Hwang, Hyun Chan; Kim, Sun Mi; Han, Doug Hyun] Chung Ang Univ Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Seoul, South Korea","Chung Ang University; Chung Ang University Hospital","Han, DH (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Seoul, South Korea.","hduk70@gmail.com","","Kim, Heejin/0000-0002-8529-4786","","","","","60","5","5","6","32","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-1078","","","FRONT PSYCHOL","Front.

Prices on the regulated CME bitcoin futures and the US-based spot exchanges react to, rather than lead, price movements on the unregulated exchanges and they may do so relatively slowly. In a multi-dimensional setting including the main price leaders within futures, perpetuals and spot markets, the CME futures have a very minor effect on price discovery, even less than the spot exchanges Bitfinex, Bitstamp and Coinbase. Our findings highlight the persistent problems stemming from inconsistent regulation in bitcoin spot and derivatives markets, including insufficient price stability and lack of resistance to manipulative trading.

A Bitcoin SPV node initiates and verifies transactions of the Bitcoin network through the Bitcoin wallet software which is deployed on a resource constrained device such as a mobile phone. Thus, the security of the wallet is critical for the SPV nodes as it may affect the security of user's cryptocurrencies. However, there are some concerns about the security flaws within the SPV nodes which could lead to significant economic losses. Most of these vulnerabilities can be resolved by employing a secure user authentication protocol. Over the years, researchers have engaged in designing a secure authentication protocol. However, most proposals have security flaws or performance issues. Recently, Park et al. proposed a two-party authenticated key exchange protocol for the mobile environment. They claimed that their protocol is not only secure against various attacks but also can be deployed efficiently. However, after a thorough security analysis, we find that the Park et al.'s protocol is vulnerable to user forgery attack, smart card stolen attack and unable to provide user anonymity. To enhance security, we proposed an efficient and secure user authentication protocol for the SPV nodes in the mobile environment which can fulfill all the security requirements and has provable security. Additionally, we provide performance analysis which shows our proposed protocol is efficient for the SPV nodes in the Bitcoin network.","[Zhou, Lu; Su, Chunhua] Univ Aizu, Div Comp Sci, Aizu Wakamatsu, Fukushima 9658580, Japan; [Ge, Chunpeng] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China","University of Aizu; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics","Ge, CP (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China.","gecp@nuaa.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61702236]; Changzhou Sci Tech Program [CJ20179027]; JSPS [18H03240, 18K11298]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Changzhou Sci Tech Program; JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","Chunpeng GE was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61702236) and Changzhou Sci & Tech Program (Grant No. CJ20179027).

The results show that there is a strong short-term volatility spillover effect in the two markets. However, Bitcoin trading volatility process weakens the short-term volatility spillover effect from Bitcoin market to banking industry in the United States and the volatility of banking industry returns (i.e. volatility of operational results) weakens the short-term volatility spillover effect from banking industry to Bitcoin market mainly due to inability of adoption in the short-run. Moreover, there is a significant and (positive) long-term volatility spillover effect from Bitcoin market to banking industry. This remarkable observation reveals that there is a possibility of banking industry adopting Bitcoin operation as a part of banking product portfolio development in the long-run. As such, imposition of any tax or trading restriction (e.g. price bands, transaction cost, tax etc.) on Bitcoin market will adversely impact the performance of banking industry in the long-run. The nature of the impact and its timing are of utmost importance for the government and policymakers, particularly in case of economic planning and restructuring of banking and financial services industry.","[Senarathne, Chamil W.; Wei Jianguo] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Econ, 122 Luoshi Rd, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China","Wuhan University of Technology","Senarathne, CW (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Econ, 122 Luoshi Rd, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.","chamil@whut.edu.cn; weijg@whut.edu.cn","","","","","","","14","0","0","2","2","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-7767-6","","","","2020","","","","","","","75","79","","10.1145/3390566.3391666","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3390566.3391666","","","5","Business, Finance; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Information Science & Library Science; Management","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics; Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science","BR1KL","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000632684300014","View Full Record in Web of Science"

To implement the proposed method, we applied machine learning to the transactions data collected from the Bitcoin network and divided our implementation into the following three objects: Data Collector; Data Preprocessor; and Analyzer. We used the random forest classifier algorithm because the problem of predicting the likelihood of a transaction to be included in the next block is a binary classification problem. We evaluated the performance of our model by comparing transactions in the mempool against transaction published in the next two blocks mined at the time of our experiments. For both blocks, our model has a prediction accuracy of more than 80% and a minimal false negative error. The analysis of transaction inclusion in the next block is fundamental as it could drive the price of Bitcoin or signify the properties of a given transaction such as illegal or legal.","[Ko, Kyungchan; Jeong, Taeyeol; Maharjan, Sajan; Lee, Chaehyeon; Hong, James Won-Ki] POSTECH, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Pohang 37673, South Korea","Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH)","Ko, K (corresponding author), POSTECH, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Pohang 37673, South Korea.","kkc90@postech.ac.kr; dreamerty@postech.ac.kr; thesajan@postech.ac.kr; chlee0211@postech.ac.kr; jwkhong@postech.ac.kr","","","ICT R&D program of MSIT/IITP in Republic of Korea [2018-000539]","ICT R&D program of MSIT/IITP in Republic of Korea(Institute for Information & Communication Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP), Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by the ICT R&D program of MSIT/IITP [No. 2018-000539, Development of Blockchain Transaction Monitoring and Analysis Technology] in Republic of Korea.","","10","1","1","0","2","SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD","SINGAPORE","152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE","1865-0929","1865-0937","978-981-15-2777-7; 978-981-15-2776-0","COMM COM INF SC","","","2020","1156","","","","","","591","597","","10.1007/978-981-15-2777-7_48","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-2777-7_48","","","7","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR5RE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000656861800048","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Bitcoin has emerged as a new alternative investment for investors which has attracted much attention from the media and investors alike. However relatively little is known about the investment benefits of Bitcoin and therefore this paper examines the benefit of including Bitcoin in a traditional benchmark portfolio of stocks and bonds. Specially, we employ data up to June 2018 and analyse the potential out-of-sample portfolio benefits resulting from including Bitcoin in a stock-bond portfolio for a range of eight popular asset allocation strategies. The out-of-sample analysis shows that, across all different asset allocation strategies and risk aversions, the benefits of Bitcoin are quite considerable with substantially higher risk-adjusted returns. Our results are robust to rolling estimation windows, the incorporation of transaction costs, the inclusion of a commodity portfolio, alternative indices, short-selling as well as two additional optimization techniques including higher moments with (and without) variance-based constraints (VBCs). Therefore, our results suggest that investors should include Bitcoin in their portfolio as it generates substantial higher risk-adjusted returns. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

There have been several solutions to the problem; however, these solutions are either insecure in the malicious model or cannot verify the validity of inputs. In this paper, we introduce Variance, a privacy-preserving two-party protocol for solving Yao's millionaires' problem in a Bitcoin setting, in which each party controls several Bitcoin accounts (single and multi signature addresses) and they want to find out who owns more bitcoins without revealing (1) how many accounts they own or the addresses associated with their accounts, (2) the balance of any of their accounts, and (3) their total wealth of bitcoins while assuring the other party that they are not claiming more bitcoin than they possess. We utilize zero knowledge proofs to provide a solution to the problem, and subsequently prove that Variance is secure against active adversaries in the malicious model.","[Holmes, Joshua; Dagher, Gaby G.] Boise State Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Boise, ID 83725 USA","Idaho; Boise State University","Holmes, J (corresponding author), Boise State Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Boise, ID 83725 USA.","","","","","","","","14","0","0","0","1","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-0-7381-0495-9","","","","2020","","","","","","","62","71","","10.1109/Blockchain50366.2020.00016","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain50366.2020.00016","","","10","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR3LS","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000647642100008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

For this purpose, they leverage the few extra bytes available for encoding custom metadata in Bitcoin transactions. A sequence of records of the same application can thus be abstracted as a stand-alone subchain inside the Bitcoin blockchain. However, several existing approaches do not make any assumptions about the consistency of their subchains, either (i) neglecting the possibility that this sequence of messages can be altered, mainly due to unhandled concurrency, network malfunctions, application bugs, or malicious users, or (ii) giving weak guarantees about their security. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose an improved version of a consensus protocol formalized in our previous work, built on top of the Bitcoin protocol, to incentivize third-party nodes to consistently extend their subchains. Besides, we perform an extensive analysis of this protocol, both defining its properties and presenting some real-world attack scenarios, to show how its specific design choices and parameter configurations can be crucial to prevent malicious practices.","[Longo, Riccardo] Univ Trento, Dept Math, I-38123 Povo, Trento, Italy; [Podda, Alessandro Sebastian; Saia, Roberto] Univ Cagliari, Dept Math & Comp Sci, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy","University of Trento; University of Cagliari","Saia, R (corresponding author), Univ Cagliari, Dept Math & Comp Sci, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy.","riccardolongomath@gmail.com; sebastianpodda@unica.it; roberto.saia@unica.it","Podda, Alessandro Sebastian/AAQ-6091-2020; Saia, Roberto/S-1754-2017; Longo, Riccardo/N-8278-2015","Podda, Alessandro Sebastian/0000-0002-7862-8362; Saia, Roberto/0000-0002-1734-0437; Longo, Riccardo/0000-0002-8739-3091","Bando 'Aiuti per progetti di Ricerca e Sviluppo'-POR FESR 2014-2020-Asse 1, Azione 1.1.3.

In this set of exploratory analyses we seek to classify Bitcoin. We utilize a variety of methods to compare aspects of its behavior to: currencies, asset classes such as derivatives, technology-based products and possible technology-based products such as Ether and the security SPY, and speculative financial bubbles.

In the Bitcoin system, miners use transaction attached fees as a driving force to mine a new block and package transactions, while users compete by bidding transaction fees for faster confirmation. Considering the particularity of Bitcoin trading system, we take time series into consideration to analyze the transaction rules of Bitcoin system from the perspective of multiple cycles and establish a dynamic game model related to time under Generalised Second Price(GSP) mechanism, and also confirm the model's superiority on saving users' fees, compared with the static game model. Also, we propose the quantification of the user experience quantified by calculating the price difference between the transactions uploaded by the same user within adjacent times, making the transaction process of the Bitcoin system no longer the final say of the transaction price. The dynamic game model shows that there is a perfect Bayesian game equilibrium solution in the payment decision, so there is no incentive for users to change the attached fee, and the whole system is maintained stably. In addition, we verify the dynamic game model from computational experiment. Firstly, it is proved that with the help of revenue discount, the cost saving of the dynamic model is generally higher than that of the static model. Then the user's revenue under the dynamic model is showing an upward trend, and the transactions order under the dynamic model is more stable than that under static model, which can be illustrated mathematically and computationally that the proposed dynamic game model in this paper will help all transactions be processed more efficiently in a uniform pipeline.","[Yan, Guanghui; Wang, Shan; Yang, Zhifei; Zhou, Yi] Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China","Lanzhou Jiaotong University","Wang, S (corresponding author), Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.","0218649@stu.lzjtu.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61162066, 61163010]; Natural Science Foundation for Young Scientists of Gansu Province [1606RJYA222]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation for Young Scientists of Gansu Province","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61162066 and Grant 61163010, and in part by the Natural Science Foundation for Young Scientists of Gansu Province under Grant 1606RJYA222.","","19","2","2","2","9","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","109198","109206","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3001157","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3001157","","","9","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","MM0MM","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000549854400030","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Now, literally everyone is interested in bitcoin', saidCNN Newswhile reporting on the bitcoin mania that haunted South Korean society in the winter of 2017-2018. This study takes that speculative frenzy as an entry point for exploring lay bitcoin investors' experiences and the 'magical' features of contemporary financial capitalism. It first situates the bitcoin investment boom in the contexts of South Korea's post-developmental transition and the rise of mass investment culture. Drawing upon participant observation of online communities for South Korea's bitcoin investors, this study then demonstrates how lay bitcoin investors' daily beliefs and practices are distinguished from more traditional economic subjectivities - namely, disciplined workers and rational investors. Lay bitcoin investors present themselves not simply as calculative investors but also as enchanted gamblers who often rely upon magical formulas and rituals that express their hopes and despairs in the face of an uncertain future. Instead of dismissing their beliefs and rituals as 'irrational exuberance', this study argues that their cultural practices should be understood as a reflexive response to the 'magical' mechanisms of the financial market based on self-referential valuation and self-fulfilling performativity. In examining how the logics of uncertainty and magic are returned at the heart of contemporary capitalism, this study consequently seeks to situate the lay investors' struggles in dealing with the ambiguous future within the broader transformation of the human condition during the triumphant rise of financial capitalism.","[Lee, Seung Cheol] Univ Mississippi, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Oxford, MS 38677 USA","University of Mississippi","Lee, SC (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Oxford, MS 38677 USA.","slee48@olemiss.edu","","Lee, Seung Cheol/0000-0002-0805-5589","","","","","74","4","4","0","3","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0950-2386","1466-4348","","CULT STUD","Cult.

The dynamics is driven by an asymmetric mean -reverting fundamental shock which can be attributed to a money demand shock. A crash occurs when the exchange rate with a weakened mean -reverting force breaches a lower boundary where a smooth -pasting condition is imposed. The empirical results show the exchange rate dynamics can be calibrated according to the model, in which the mean reversion of the dynamics is positively co -integrated with the Bitcoin transaction volume indicating demand for Bitcoin; and with the risk reversals of the commodity currencies (Australian dollar and Canadian dollar) in currency option markets. The analysis shows that the Bitcoin ex- change rate shares some characteristics of commodity currencies with crash risk.

Bitcoin is a digital currency and a payment system. The blockchain is a digital ledger that records every bitcoin transaction that has ever occurred. The users' privacy is preserved in the bitcoin exchange by using the blockchain. In some application scenarios, it is important to show the buyer's assets strength in order to avoid the troublemakers. At the same time, it is also necessary to preserve the buyer's assets privacy. In this paper, we propose the novel concept of DV-PoA (designated-verifier proof of assets) for bitcoin exchange. Since bitcoin exchange's signature takes use of the elliptic curve cryptography, we design the first concrete DV-PoA scheme by using elliptic curve cryptography in order to be consistent with it. Then, we prove the security of the proposed DV-PoA scheme. After that, we analyze its efficiency from the two cases: theory and implementation. Our analysis shows that the designed DV-PoA scheme is provably secure and efficient. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, the number of messages needed to propagate a single transaction is very high which is rather wasteful in terms of bandwidth utilization. In this work we propose a simple modification of Bitcoin software that allows a vast reduction of the number of messages needed for propagating a transaction over the network. The modification consists of deferring the transaction announcements until a certain predefined number of new transactions is collected. We show that the number of messages can be substantially reduced in this manner. The price to pay for this reduction is an increase in transaction propagation delay. However, the tradeoff between the reduction of traffic and transaction delay can be minimized by judicious choice of the threshold number of deferred transactions.","[Misic, Vojislav B.; Misic, Jelena] Ryerson Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Chang, Xiaolin] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing Key Lab Secur & Privacy Intelligent Trans, Beijing, Peoples R China","Toronto Metropolitan University; Beijing Jiaotong University","Misic, VB (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada.","","","","","","","","7","1","1","0","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2334-0983","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","IEEE GLOB COMM CONF","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322130","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322130","","","6","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BR7QI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000668970500075","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It has previously been argued that the only side effect of quantum mining would be an increased difficulty. In this work, we argue that a crucial argument in the analysis of Bitcoin security breaks down when quantum mining is performed. Classically, a Bitcoin fork occurs rarely, i.e., when two miners find a block almost simultaneously, due to propagation time effects. The situation differs dramatically when quantum miners use Grover's algorithm, which repeatedly applies a procedure called a Grover iteration. The chances of finding a block grow quadratically with the number of Grover iterations applied. Crucially, a miner does not have to choose how many iterations to apply in advance. Suppose Alice receives Bob's new block. To maximize her revenue, she should stop and measure her state immediately in the hopes that her block (rather than Bob's) will become part of the longest chain. The strong correlation between the miners' actions and the fact that they all measure their states at the same time may lead to more forks-which is known to be a security risk for Bitcoin. We propose a mechanism that, we conjecture, will prevent this form of quantum mining, thereby circumventing the high rate of forks.","[Sattath, Or] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Comp Sci Dept, Beer Sheva, Israel","Ben Gurion University","Sattath, O (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Comp Sci Dept, Beer Sheva, Israel.","sattath@gmail.com","","Sattath, Or/0000-0001-7567-3822","","","","","39","2","2","0","7","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1615-5262","1615-5270","","INT J INF SECUR","Int.

We decompose the realized volatility into common and idiosyncratic volatilities, as well as the good and bad volatilities. Then the asymmetry in volatility spillovers between Bitcoin markets is measured by the DY (Diebold and Yilmaz) index. In addition, we construct statistics to test the asymmetry in volatility spillovers between different Bitcoin markets. The results are achieved as follows. The spillovers of systematic and idiosyncratic volatilities dominate the connectedness among different Bitcoin markets. In addition, the idiosyncratic volatility spillovers are more easily influenced by policies. Good volatility spillovers dominate the Bitcoin markets and change over time. The further results suggest that there is significant asymmetry between systematic and idiosyncratic volatility spillovers in the Bitcoin markets, while the asymmetries between good and bad volatility spillovers are heterogeneous in different markets. The findings in this paper can provide some suggestions for regulators controlling market stability and investors generating investment strategies.","[Chen, Shuanglian] Guangzhou Int Inst Finance, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shuanglian] Guangzhou Univ, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Dong, Hao] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Stat, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Guangzhou University; Guangzhou University","Dong, H (corresponding author), Guangzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Stat, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.","donghao@e.gzhu.edu.cn","","","National Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2020A1515010746]","National Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province)","This research was funded by the National Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, grant number 2020A1515010746.","","61","1","1","5","21","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","2296-424X","","","FRONT PHYS-LAUSANNE","Front.

Findings The results show that expectation has a positive impact on perceived enjoyment and perceived ease of use. A positive relationship between perceived ease of use and perceived enjoyment was confirmed. The findings also reveal that expectation, perceived enjoyment and perceived ease of use have significant impact on satisfaction. Moreover, it is found that perceived enjoyment, perceived ease of use and satisfaction significantly influence the repurchase intention of Bitcoin. Research limitations/implications This study encourages future comparative studies to be conducted. Besides, it is recommended to find out other possible antecedents of repurchase intention. Moreover, this study suggested negative effects of Bitcoin to be explored. Practical implications In a practical standpoint, this study provides valuable suggestions about cryptocurrencies use and regularization. For instance, education and learnability issues of novice users need to be considered. Further, the regularization/implementation of cryptocurrencies/blockchain technologies is also suggested. Originality/value This is the pioneer endeavor which investigates the repurchase intention of Bitcoin. The findings explore some of the possible antecedents which influence repurchase intention of Bitcoin. These findings provide valuable insights and enrich the existing body of literature in the domain of Bitcoin.","[Nadeem, Muhammad Athar; Liu, Zhiying; Xu, Yi] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Pitafi, Abdul Hameed] Sir Syed Univ Engn & Technol Karachi, Dept Comp Sci, Sindh, Pakistan; [Pitafi, Abdul Hameed] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Management, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Younis, Amna] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Publ Affairs, Hefei, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Hefei University of Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Xu, Y (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, Hefei, Peoples R China.","athar@mail.ustc.edu.cn; liuzhiy@ustc.edu.cn; hameedpitafi@hfut.edu.cn; amna@mail.ustc.edu.cn; xuyi@ustc.edu.cn","","Pitafi, Abdul Hameed/0000-0002-2781-267X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71472172, WY2040150003]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Fund No. 71472172) and Project Fund No. WY2040150003.","","104","8","8","6","24","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","2514-9288","2514-9318","","DATA TECHNOL APPL","Data Technol.

The blockchain technology that has emerged in recent years has the characteristics of decentralization and tamper resistance, which can effectively alleviate the disadvantages and problems of traditional covert communication. However, its combination with covert communication thus far has been mostly at the theoretical level. The BLOCCE method, as an early result of the combination of blockchain and covert communication technology, has the problems of low information embedding efficiency, the use of too many Bitcoin addresses, low communication efficiency, and high costs. The present research improved on this method, designed the V-BLOCCE which uses base58 to encrypt the plaintext and reuses the addresses generated by Vanitygen multiple times to embed information. This greatly improves the efficiency of information embedding and decreases the number of Bitcoin addresses used. Under the premise of ensuring the order, the Bitcoin transaction OP_RETURN field is used to store the information required to restore the plaintext and the transactions are issued at the same time to improve the information transmission efficiency. Thus, a more efficient and feasible method for the application of covert communication on the blockchain is proposed. In addition, this paper also provides a more feasible scheme and theoretical support for covert communication in blockchain.","[Zhang, Lejun; Zhang, Zhijie; Waqas, Rasheed; Zhao, Chunhui] Yangzhou Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Yangzhou 225127, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lejun] Quanzhou Normal Univ, Sch Math & Comp Sci, Quanzhou 362000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Weizheng] Univ Aizu, Aizu Wakamatsu 9658580, Japan; [Zhao, Chunhui] Harbin Engn Univ, Coll Informat & Commun Engn, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Kim, Seokhoon] Soonchunhyang Univ, Dept Comp Software Engn, Asan, South Korea; [Chen, Huiling] Wenzhou Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Wenzhou 325035, Peoples R China","Yangzhou University; Quanzhou Normal University; University of Aizu; Harbin Engineering University; Soonchunhyang University; Wenzhou University","Chen, HL (corresponding author), Wenzhou Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Wenzhou 325035, Peoples R China.","chenhuiling.jlu@gmail.com","Chen, Huiling/N-8510-2019","Chen, Huiling/0000-0002-7714-9693","Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province of China [LC2016024]; Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions [17KJB520044]; Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province [XYDXX-108]","Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province); Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province","This work is sponsored by the Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province of China under Grant No. LC2016024.

In bitcoin system, parties (miners) compete to create blocks by doing publicly verifiable proofs of sequential work (proof-of-work) and the probability that a party wins the competition is proportional to the amount of computational power that he has invested. Note that its security holds under honest majority assumption in terms of the amount of computational power. In this paper, we provide the formal analysis of bitcoin backbone protocol in the non-flat model. Precisely, we rethink and redefine the model of computing puzzles to capture the real-world protocol execution, where each party owns different amount of computational power and does sequential computations towards a puzzle independently. Fortunately, our work obtains the better results in analyzing the security of bitcoin backbone protocol, which can reflect the real-world protocol execution better, without any additional assumptions but the honest majority assumption. Finally, we show that a robust public transaction ledger can be built on top of bitcoin backbone protocol in our model securely.","[Ni, Peifang; Li, Hongda; Pan, Dongxue] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, State Key Lab Informat Secur, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Ni, Peifang; Li, Hongda; Pan, Dongxue] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Cyber Secur, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Ni, Peifang; Li, Hongda; Pan, Dongxue] Chinese Acad Sci, Data Assurance & Commun Secur Res Ctr, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Engineering, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Li, HD (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, State Key Lab Informat Secur, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.;Li, HD (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Cyber Secur, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;Li, HD (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Data Assurance & Commun Secur Res Ctr, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.","lihongda@iie.ac.cn","","","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0802500]; Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Project [Z191100007119007]","National Key R&D Program of China; Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Project","This work was supported by National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFB0802500) and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Project (Grant No. Z191100007119007).","","29","0","0","2","6","SCIENCE PRESS","BEIJING","16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA","1674-733X","1869-1919","","SCI CHINA INFORM SCI","Sci.

Here, transaction fees serve as the important tuner for the Bitcoin system to define the priorities in users' transaction confirmation. In this paper, we aim to study the priority rule for queueing transactions based on their associated fees, and in turn users' strategies in formulating their fees in the transaction confirmation game. We first establish a full-information game-theoretical model to study users' equilibrium fee decisions; and then discuss three types of Nash equilibria, under which no, all and some users submit transaction fees. Moreover, we conduct empirical studies and design computational experiments to validate our theoretical analysis. The experimental results show that (1) users' fee decisions will be significantly affected by their waiting time; (2) the reduced time costs, instead of transaction values, are the basis for users to evaluate their revenues; (3) longer waiting time and higher unit time cost drive users to submit transaction fees in pursuit of desired priorities; (4) with the required transaction fee increasing, the proportion of fee-submitting users decreases slowly at first followed by a sharp decline, and over-high required fees will make the transaction confirmation game end up with no users submitting fees.","[Li, Juanjuan] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Automat, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Li, Juanjuan; Yuan, Yong; Wang, Fei-Yue] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, State Key Lab Management & Control Complex Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Beijing Institute of Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Automation, CAS","Yuan, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, State Key Lab Management & Control Complex Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.","juanjuan.li@ia.ac.cn; yong.yuan@ia.ac.cn; feiyue.wang@ia.ac.cn","Yuan, Yuan/GVS-5120-2022","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61533019]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","We gratefully acknowledge the funding supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (#61533019).","","30","2","2","6","27","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1389-5753","1572-9362","","ELECTRON COMMER RES","Electron.

Stock market prediction is a major challenge owing to non-stationary, blaring, and chaotic data and thus, the prediction becomes challenging among the investors to invest the money for making profits. Initially, the blockchain network is fed to the blockchain network bridge from which the bitcoin data is acquired that is followed with the bitcoin prediction. Bitcoin prediction is performed using the proposed FuzzyCSA-based Deep Long short-term memory (LSTM). At first, the flow strength indicators are extracted based on Double exponential moving average (DEMA), Rate of Change (ROCR), Average True Range (ATR), Simple Moving Average (SMA), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) from the blockchain data. Based on the extracted features, the prediction is done using FuzzyCSA-based Deep LSTM, which is the combination of FuzzyCSA with Deep LSTM. Then, the CSA is modified using the fuzzy operator for determining the optimal weights in Deep LSTM. The experimentation of the proposed method is performed from the openly available dataset. The analysis of the method in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) reveals that the proposed FuzzyCSA-based Deep LSTM acquired a minimal MAE of 0.4811, and the minimal RMSE of 0.3905, respectively.","[Ravi, Chandrasekar] Natl Inst Technol Puducherry, Pondicherry, India","National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Puducherry","Ravi, C (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol Puducherry, Pondicherry, India.","","","","","","","","34","4","4","0","8","IGI GLOBAL","HERSHEY","701 E CHOCOLATE AVE, STE 200, HERSHEY, PA 17033-1240 USA","1947-3532","1947-3540","","INT J DISTRIB SYST T","Int.

A well-known and unusual feature is that Bitcoin's price often fluctuates significantly, which has however received less attention. In this paper, we investigate the Bitcoin price fluctuation prediction problem, which can be described as whether Bitcoin price keeps or reversals after a large fluctuation. In this paper, three kinds of features are presented for the price fluctuation prediction, including basic features, traditional technical trading indicators, and features generated by a Denoising autoencoder. We evaluate these features using an Attentive LSTM network and an Embedding Network (ALEN). In particular, an attentive LSTM network can capture the time dependency representation of Bitcoin price and an embedding network can capture the hidden representations from related cryptocurrencies. Experimental results demonstrate that ALEN achieves superior state-of-the-art performance among all baselines. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of parameters on the Bitcoin price fluctuation prediction problem, which can be further used in a real trading environment by investors.","[Li, Yang; Zheng, Zibin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Li, Yang; Zheng, Zibin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Digital Life, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Dai, Hong-Ning] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Informat Technol, Macau 999078, Peoples R China","Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Macau University of Science & Technology","Zheng, ZB (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.;Zheng, ZB (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Digital Life, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.;Dai, HN (corresponding author), Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Informat Technol, Macau 999078, Peoples R China.","liyang99@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; zhzibin@mail.sysu.edu.cn; hndai@ieee.org","Zheng, Zibin/E-3024-2014; Zheng, Zibin/HCH-2408-2022; Dai, Hong-Ning/B-1931-2012","Zheng, Zibin/0000-0002-7878-4330; Zheng, Zibin/0000-0002-7878-4330; Dai, Hong-Ning/0000-0001-6165-4196; Li, Yang/0000-0001-5653-1829","National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFB1000101]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1811461, 61722214]; Macao Science and Technology Development Fund under Macao Funding Scheme for Key RD Projects [0025/2019/AKP]","National Key Research and Development Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Macao Science and Technology Development Fund under Macao Funding Scheme for Key RD Projects","The work described in this paper was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program (2016YFB1000101), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1811461, 61722214) and Macao Science and Technology Development Fund under Macao Funding Scheme for Key R&D Projects (0025/2019/AKP).","","39","3","3","1","11","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2076-3417","","APPL SCI-BASEL","Appl.

One of them is Bitcoin, the most popular and highest valued cryptocurrency on the market. The SHA256 is the main processing part in Bitcoin mining, to date the difficulty of which is extremely high and still increases relentlessly. Hence, it is essential to improve the speed of the SHA256 cores in the Bitcoin mining system. In this paper, we propose a two-level pipeline hardware architecture for the SHA256 processing. The first-level pipeline helps the system reduce the number of operating cycles. Besides, the maximum frequency of the system is boosted by the second-level pipeline. The proposed hardware is implemented on FPGA Xilinx Virtex 7-VC707 (28 nm technology). The mining hash rate using the proposed pipeline SHA256 cores reaches 514.92 MH/s that improves 2.4 times compared to the FPGA based conventional technique. The throughput of SHA core of current study is 296.108 Gbps that is 240 times higher compared to the standard technique. The proposed architecture is also implemented in an ASIC design using ROHM 180 nm CMOS technology, which resulted in a throughput of 69.28 Gbps that is 18 times higher than that of conventional work implemented in Intel 14 nm process.","[Le Vu Trung Duong; Nguyen Thi Thanh Thuy; Lam Duc Khai] Univ Informat Technol, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Le Vu Trung Duong; Nguyen Thi Thanh Thuy; Lam Duc Khai] Vietnam Natl Univ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","Vietnam National University Hochiminh City","Khai, LD (corresponding author), Univ Informat Technol, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.","15520146@gm.uit.edu.vn; 15520865@gm.uit.edu.vn; khaild@uit.edu.vn","","Lam, Duc Khai/0000-0003-2711-1408","University of Information TechnologyVietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City [D1-2020-07]","University of Information TechnologyVietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City","This research is funded by University of Information TechnologyVietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City under grant number D1-2020-07.","","13","11","11","6","26","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0167-9260","1872-7522","","INTEGRATION","Integration-VLSI J.","SEP","2020","74","","","","","","107","114","","10.1016/j.vlsi.2020.05.003","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vlsi.2020.05.003","","","8","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","LW7JH","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000539319200011","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Its market capitalization transcends all other cryptocurrencies in the market. But its high monetary value also makes it an attractive target to cyber criminal actors. Hacking campaigns usually target the weakest points in an ecosystem. In Bitcoin, these are currently the exchange platforms. As each exchange breach potentially decreases Bitcoin's market value by billions, it is a threat not only to direct victims, but to everyone owning Bitcoin. Based on an extensive analysis of 36 breaches of Bitcoin exchanges, we show the attack patterns used to exploit Bitcoin exchange platforms using an industry standard for reporting intelligence on cyber security breaches. Based on this we are able to provide an overview of the most common attack vectors, showing that all except three hacks were possible due to relatively lax security. We also show that while the security regimen of Bitcoin exchanges is not on par with other financial service providers, the use of stolen credentials, which does not require any hacking, is decreasing. We also show that the amount of BTC taken during a breach is decreasing, as well as the exchanges that terminate after being breached. With exchanges being targeted by nation-state hacking groups, security needs to be a first concern.","[Oosthoek, Kris; Doerr, Christian] Delft Univ Technol, Cyber Threat Intelligence Lab, Delft, Netherlands","Delft University of Technology","Oosthoek, K (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Cyber Threat Intelligence Lab, Delft, Netherlands.","k.oosthoek@tudelft.nl; c.doerr@tudelft.nl","","","","","","","71","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-6680-3","","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7IE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000848725400021","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The potential threat to online transactions is not only limited to the anonymity of identities such as address and pseudonyms, but also other sensitive information shown on scripts like transaction amounts. We propose a framework to hide the amounts by employing the Paillier cryptosystem for encryption and decryption. Due to its homomorphic properties, we create a dumb account which can receive the same amounts of bitcoins in each transaction but cannot spend them. This ensures that the hidden amounts are always positive, and keeps the equality between the Input-sum and the Output-sum via the commitment proofs. Our framework achieves delicate anonymity and prevents active and passive attacks, which effectively improves the transaction privacy. Analyses show that our proposal is secure and practical.

Based on the existing asset bubble theory, we verified the Bitcoin bubble based on the production cost with the application of VAR and LPPL models, and this method achieved good predictive power. The following conclusions are reached: (1) PECR is constructed to depict the deviation degree between the price and production cost, while BC is used to illustrate the bubble size in the price, and both are effective measures; (2) the number of unique addresses is a suitable measure of the use value of Bitcoin, and this result has passed the Granger causality test; (3) PECR and BC are verified via the LPPL model, and the next large bubble is expected in the second half of 2020. Considering that Bitcoin will see 'output halved' in May 2020, this prediction is a high-probability event.","[Xiong, Jinwu] China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Business Sch, Fuxue Rd 27, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qing; Zhao, Lei] Chinese Univ Hongkong Shenzhen, Shenzhen Finance Inst, Longxiang Rd 2001, Shenzhen 518116, Peoples R China","China University of Political Science & Law","Liu, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hongkong Shenzhen, Shenzhen Finance Inst, Longxiang Rd 2001, Shenzhen 518116, Peoples R China.","xiongjw@cupl.edu.cn; qingliu@link.cuhk.edu.cn; leizhao@link.cuhk.edu.cn","","","Program for Excellent Young Teacher in China University of Political Science and Law [DSJCXZ180420]","Program for Excellent Young Teacher in China University of Political Science and Law","Supported by Program for Excellent Young Teacher in China University of Political Science and Law (DSJCXZ180420).

Blockchain technology is efficient and can operate without a trusted party to store all transaction information; additionally, it provides transparency and prevents the tampering of transaction information. However, new security threats can occur because blockchain technology shares all the transaction information. Furthermore, studies have reported that the private keys of users who use the same signature value two or more times can be recovered. Because private keys of blockchain identify users, private key leaks can result in attackers stealing the ownership rights to users' property. Therefore, as more financial services use blockchain technology, actions to counteract the threat of private key recovery must be continually investigated. Private key recovery studies are presented here. Based on these studies, duplicated signatures generated by blockchain users are defined. Additionally, scenarios that generate and use duplicated signatures are applied in an actual bitcoin environment to demonstrate that actual bitcoin users' private keys can be recovered.","[Ko, Ju-Seong] Ajou Univ, Dept Comp Engn, ISAA Lab, Suwon, South Korea; [Kwak, Jin] Ajou Univ, Dept Cyber Secur, Suwon, South Korea","Ajou University; Ajou University","Kwak, J (corresponding author), Ajou Univ, Dept Cyber Secur, Suwon, South Korea.","jsko.isaa@gmail.com; security@ajou.ac.kr","","Kwak, Jin/0000-0001-6931-2705","MSIT(Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC(Information Technology Research Center) support program [IITP-2019-2016-0-00304]","MSIT(Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC(Information Technology Research Center) support program","This research was supported by the MSIT(Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC(Information Technology Research Center) support program (IITP-2019-2016-0-00304) supervised by the IITP(Institute for Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation)","","16","0","0","4","8","KSII-KOR SOC INTERNET INFORMATION","GANGNAM-GU","KOR SCI & TECHNOL CTR, 409 ON 4TH FLR, MAIN BLDG, 635-4 YEOKSAM 1-DONG, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL 00000, SOUTH KOREA","1976-7277","","","KSII T INTERNET INF","KSII Trans.

However, the timestamp of a block in the blockchain is introduced by the blockchain node and can be manipulated in hours. This will either lead the failure of the evidence storage system built on top of the blockchain platform or increase the risk of double spending of the blockchain platform itself. In this paper, we introduced an optimized blockchain timestamp mechanism. We narrow the range of the timestamp in a block to an average of ten minutes by leveraging an outside trust timestamp service to the blockchain consensus.

Bitcoin is the expression of its main application since it was the first new currency that gained popularity some years after its release date and it is still the major cryptocurrency in the market. For this reason, the present analysis is focused on studying its price determination, which seems to be still almost unpredictable. We carry out an empirical analysis based on a cost of production model, trying to detect whether the Bitcoin price could be justified by and connected to the profits and costs associated with the mining effort. We construct a sample model, composed of the hardware devices employed in the mining process. After collecting the technical information required and computing a cost and a profit function for each period, an implied price for the Bitcoin value is derived. The interconnection between this price and the historical one is analyzed, adopting a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model. Our main results put on evidence that there aren't ultimate drivers for Bitcoin price; probably many factors should be expressed and studied at the same time, taking into account their variability and different relevance over time. It seems that the historical price fluctuated around the model (or implied) price until 2017, when the Bitcoin price significantly increased. During the last months of 2018, the prices seem to converge again, following a common path. In detail, we focus on the time window in which Bitcoin experienced its higher price volatility; the results suggest that it is disconnected from the one predicted by the model. These findings may depend on the particular features of the new cryptocurrencies, which have not been completely understood yet. In our opinion, there is not enough knowledge on cryptocurrencies to assert that Bitcoin price is (or is not) based on the profit and cost derived by the mining process, but these intrinsic characteristics must be considered, including other possible Bitcoin price drivers.","[Baldan, Cinzia; Zen, Francesco] Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, Padua, Italy","University of Padua","Baldan, C (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, Padua, Italy.","cinzia.baldan@unipd.it","","","","","","","33","2","2","1","2","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","2624-8212","","FRONT ARTIF INTELL","Front.

Within this context, there exists a growing need for accurate information. Various organizations need this for multiple purposes like properly assessing the urgency of the problem, implementing the right policy response in the right locations and for setting up mitigation programs. We propose a market dynamics approach to evaluate the current methods for obtaining information on Bitcoin's energy demand. This allows us to establish that, while historically the Bitcoin mining industry has been growing most of the time, this growth allows market participants to pursue strategies that don't necessarily involve the best devices, device settings, or locations. The bigger the profitability of mining, the more it allows market participants to make decisions that result in suboptimal power efficiency of the Bitcoin network. Specifically, while the profitability of mining peaked during 2019, we find that market participants primarily used older generations of devices with better availability and lower acquisition costs. Common estimation approaches don't only fail to capture this behavior, but also fail to properly capture the market circumstances, like seasonal and geographic variation in electricity prices, that help enable participants to do so in the first place. This combination leaves common approaches prone to providing optimistic estimates during growth cycles. We conservatively estimate the Bitcoin network to consume 87.1 TWh of electrical energy annually per September 30, 2019 (equaling a country like Belgium).","","","","alex@digiconomist.net","de Vries, Alex/HCI-0924-2022","de Vries, Alex/0000-0002-9594-1289","","","","","30","21","21","4","37","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","2214-6296","2214-6326","","ENERGY RES SOC SCI","Energy Res.

The analysis revealed significant relationships between the performed network centrality measures and national levels of economic freedom. In particular, as confirmed by the implemented multilevel regression models, high levels of freedom to trade internationally combined with a restrained value of inflation and low administrative requirements can be considered as determining factors for fintech development. The study also showed a large number of Bitcoin transactions conducted in those countries characterized by fewer capital controls and restrictions, a result that feeds suspicions of illegal behavior, such as money laundering or terrorism financing, carried out through the use of cryptocurrencies.

The offshoots of this technology however are not limited and are rapidly spreading in other domains such as oil market. This paper investigates the causally or influences that both markets, Bitcoin price (BP) and oil price (OP) have on each other by applying the bootstrap Granger causal relationship tests considering full as well as sub-samples. Our analysis reveals that shocks originated in OP and transmitted towards BP can be both positive or negative. The positive impact indicates that Bitcoin can be viewed as an asset helpful in avoiding the risks of the high OP, which also indicates that Bitcoin and oil are in the same boat, however, the negative effects cannot support this view. The negative influence of OP on BP can be explained by the burst of the Bitcoin bubble which has weakened its hedging ability. In turn, there is also a negative influence or reverse causally running from BP to OP, highlighting that the demand for oil by investors can be threatened by the increasing BP. Keeping in view the more integrated and complexed financial dynamics which are the results of Fourth Industrial Revolution, investors can benefit from this interrelationship to diversify the risks and optimize their investment by building a more balanced portfolio. Also, governments could promote and protect the healthy development of the Bitcoin and energy market by preventing the Bitcoin bubbles and understanding the reasons of oil price volatility.","[Su, Chi-Wei] Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Qin, Meng] Natl Acad Governance, Cent Comm Communist Party China, Party Sch, Grad Acad, 100 Dayouzhuang, Beijing 100000, Peoples R China; [Tao, Ran] Qingdao Municipal Ctr Dis Control & Preventat, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Umar, Muhammad] Qingdao Univ, Sch Business, Qingdao, Peoples R China","Qingdao University; Qingdao University","Qin, M (corresponding author), Natl Acad Governance, Cent Comm Communist Party China, Party Sch, Grad Acad, 100 Dayouzhuang, Beijing 100000, Peoples R China.","meng575316928@126.com","Umar, Muhammad/AFG-9168-2022; Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021","Umar, Muhammad/0000-0001-5773-5954; ","","","","","63","116","116","11","82","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","0040-1625","1873-5509","","TECHNOL FORECAST SOC","Technol.

Since then, a number of protocols based on the Nakamoto consensus have been proposed to improve the blockchain throughput while maintaining a similar level of security. In addition to bitcoin, this work also studies the Prism protocol proposed by Bagaria, Kannan, Tse, Fanti, and Viswanath in 2018. The liveness and consistency properties of the bitcoin and the Prism backbone protocols have been established by assuming either explicitly or implicitly that the blockchains have finite lifespan. While the lifespan can be arbitrarily large, it is unsatisfying for the security guarantee to be dependent on this parameter. In addition, most analyses also assume lockstep synchrony, where by the end of each round all honest miners have complete information about all blocks published until then. This paper presents a streamlined and strengthened analysis of the liveness and consistency of bitcoin and Prism protocols without the finite lifespan assumption. Also, we use the non-lockstep synchronous model which assumes the block propagation delays to be heterogeneous, arbitrary, and upper bounded by some constant. A probabilistic guarantee is also provided for a transaction to become permanent in the final ledger of all honest miners. In lieu of order optimal results, these properties take the form of explicit bounds, which provide improved design references for public transaction ledger protocols.","[Li, Jing; Guo, Dongning] Northwestern Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Northwestern University","Li, J (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.","jingli2015@u.northwestern.edu; dGuo@northwestern.edu","","","","","","","25","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-6680-3","","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7IE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000848725400064","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Bitcoin, by far the most prominent cryptocurrency, currently trades around $9,500 USD. Why is Bitcoin valuable? is a question often heard but seldom answered well. It is not the legal tender of any nation, nor does it represent anything of physical or intrinsic value. Some people attribute its value to its scarcity, others to its anonymity, and others to its immutability, all of which are created and managed by a computer algorithm. Current theories fail to explain Bitcoin's value, or it is not immediately apparent how they might explain it. We are therefore motivated to investigate the sources of cryptocurrency value through the emergent value systems of the Bitcoin community. We use concourse theory and Q-methodology to discover five types of Bitcoin value systems that are complementary and coexisting facets of a collective whole, each type being its own internally consistent theory of value, and therefore our typology avoids simplistic generalizations about cryptocurrencies and the motivations behind those involved. We named the types: Fintech, Libertarians, Purists, Average Joe, and Gentrifier. Of interest, four of the five types we identified appear not to value Bitcoin for its monetary or market value, despite what is usually assumed. Instead, Bitcoin is associated with its potential as an alternative currency that may be used to exchange value, to mitigate various forms of risk, or as a force for social and cultural change. These five types may also underlie broader digital innovation processes and provide a basis from which to understand them.","[Wingreen, Stephen C.] Univ Canterbury, Dept Accounting & Informat Syst, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Kavanagh, Donncha; Ennis, Paul John; Miscione, Gianluca] Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Coll Business, Dublin, Ireland","University of Canterbury; University College Dublin","Wingreen, SC (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Dept Accounting & Informat Syst, Christchurch, New Zealand.","stephen.wingreen@canterbuiy.ac.nz; donncha.kavanagh@ucd.ie; paul.ennis@ucd.ie; gianluca.miscione@ucd.ie","Miscione, Gianluca/A-1199-2009; Wingreen, Stephen/GWM-8208-2022","Miscione, Gianluca/0000-0003-1479-6567; Wingreen, Stephen C./0000-0002-3784-3189; Dylan-Ennis, Paul/0000-0002-9882-6534","","","","","54","3","3","1","41","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1086-4415","1557-9301","","INT J ELECTRON COMM","Int.

In this work, we analyze how Lightning Network (LN), which represents a relevant infrastructural novelty, is influenced by the market dynamics of its referring cryptocurrency, namely Bitcoin. In so doing, we focus on how the LN is efficient in performing transactions and we relate this feature to the market conditions of Bitcoin. By applying the Toda-Yamamoto variant of Granger-causality, we note that market conditions of Bitcoin do not significantly influence the topological configuration of the LN. Hence, although the LN represents a second layer on the Bitcoin blockchain, our findings suggest that its efficient functioning does not appear to be related to the simple market performance of its underlying cryptocurrency and, in particular, of its volatile market fluctuations. This result may therefore contribute to shed light on the practical usage of the LN as a blockchain technology to favor transactions.","[Martinazzi, Stefano; Flori, Andrea] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, I-20121 Milan, Italy; [Regoli, Daniele] Intesa Sanpaolo, Data Sci & Artificial Intelligence, I-20121 Milan, Italy","Polytechnic University of Milan; Intesa Sanpaolo Bank","Martinazzi, S (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, I-20121 Milan, Italy.","stefano.martinazzi@polimi.it; daniele.regoli@sns.it; andrea.flori@polimi.it","","Martinazzi, Stefano/0000-0001-7323-4244; regoli, daniele/0000-0003-2711-8343; Flori, Andrea/0000-0002-9861-3598","","","","","82","1","1","1","2","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-9091","","RISKS","Risks","DEC","2020","8","4","","","","","","","129","10.3390/risks8040129","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/risks8040129","","","18","Business, Finance","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Business & Economics","PJ3RJ","","Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000601689100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We find evidence of right-tail dependence between Bitcoin returns and the S&P 500 in the long term and weaker normal return dependence between Bitcoin and the US Dollar (USD)-Euro (EUR) foreign exchange rate in the monthly term. In addition, we note that the dependence between Bitcoin and commodity as well as oil, and silver decrease the most within their respective medium return quantiles over the short term. Furthermore, we document a one-way causality running from each of the financial assets considered to Bitcoin in different quantiles of the return distribution.

As a result, many other cryptocurrencies were introduced for addressing these issues, but the Bitcoin network is still the most widely used payment system. Without doubt, to benefit from its network of users, there is a need for novel solutions that can successfully address the problems about high transaction fees and transaction verification times. Recently, payment network ideas have been introduced including the Lightning Network (LN) which exploits off-chain bidirectional payment channels between parties. As off-chain links can be configured to perform aggregated transactions at certain intervals without writing to blockchain, this would not only reduce the transaction fees but also decrease the verification times significantly. Nevertheless, LN still deploys relay nodes which charge fees and its growth leads certain nodes to become monopolies which defeat the very purpose of decentralization. Despite the thought that LN will provide a scale-free network mechanism along with high decentralization, how to form such a network among multiple parties is never studied before. Therefore, in this paper, by exploiting the LN, we offer to form a purely decentralized payment network which will allow Bitcoin to handle a lot of transactions with enough capacity. The idea is to form a network of retailers (i.e., nodes) which do business with Bitcoin by connecting them through off-chain links (i.e., payment channels) based on the business needs. The problem is initially modeled as a network optimization but since scalability would be a concern the next steps follow a heuristic approach where certain links are pruned to force evenly distributed payment flows while minimizing the total investments made to create initial off-chain links. The evaluations demonstrate the extent of scalability of the network along with the trade-offs between the distribution of flows and the initial flow capacities of the nodes.

The period examined covers from March 2012 up to March 2020. Econometric outcomes indicate that Bitcoin returns and volatility are positively influenced by gold returns and the S&P500 volatility index (VIX). Nevertheless, it is revealed that the innovative Geopolitical Risk Index by Caldara and Iacoviello (2019) exerts negative impacts on Bitcoin markets.

Bitcoin is somewhat different in this respect because there isn't an underlying asset upon which its valuemay depend on. Here, by constructing a simple linear time series model, and by attempting to explain the variation in the residual signal by means of macroeconomic and currency exchange variables, we illustrate that the influencing variables are vastly different for cryptocurrencies from a stock indices (S&P 500) in both timescales analysed (daily and monthly values).

Because of its highly volatile nature, there is a need for good predictions on which to base investment decisions. Although existing studies have leveraged machine learning for more accurate Bitcoin price prediction, few have focused on the feasibility of applying different modeling techniques to samples with different data structures and dimensional features. To predict Bitcoin price at different frequencies using machine learning techniques, we first classify Bitcoin price by daily price and high-frequency price. A set of high-dimension features including property and network, trading and market, attention and gold spot price are used for Bitcoin daily price prediction, while the basic trading features acquired from a cryptocurrency exchange are used for 5-minute interval price prediction. Statistical methods including Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis for Bitcoin daily price prediction with high-dimensional features achieve an accuracy of 66%, outperforming more complicated machine learning algorithms. Compared with benchmark results for daily price prediction, we achieve a better performance, with the highest accuracies of the statistical methods and machine learning algorithms of 66% and 65.3%, respectively. Machine learning models including Random Forest, XGBoost, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine and Long Short-term Memory for Bitcoin 5-minute interval price prediction are superior to statistical methods, with accuracy reaching 67.2%. Our investigation of Bitcoin price prediction can be considered a pilot study of the importance of the sample dimension in machine learning techniques. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We use a Continuous Time Markov Chain to model wake-up and sleeping behavior of each node in the network. We also calculate synchronization time, including transaction deficit recovery, when a node rejoins the network. When a node is absent from the network, it misses blocks mined during its absence but also some of the transactions which may be omitted from the subsequent compact blocks. Our results indicate that synchronization time takes more than a minute when node is away from the network for several hours.

Several types of illicit users hide behind the blanket of anonymity. Uncovering these entities is key for forensic investigations. Current methods utilize machine learning for identifying these illicit entities. However, the existing approaches only focus on a limited category of illicit users. The current paper proposes to address the issue by implementing an ensemble of decision trees for supervised learning. More parameters allow the ensemble model to learn discriminating features that can categorize multiple groups of illicit users from licit users. To evaluate the model, a dataset of 1216 real-life entities on Bitcoin was extracted from the Blockchain. Nine Features were engineered to train the model for segregating 16 different licit-illicit categories of users. The proposed model provided a reliable tool for forensic study. Empirical evaluation of the proposed model vis-a-vis three existing benchmark models was performed to highlight its efficacy. Experiments showed that the specificity and sensitivity of the proposed model were comparable to other models. Due to higher parameters of the ensemble tree model, the classification accuracy was 0.91, with 95% CI - 0.8727, 0.9477. This was better than SVM and Logistic Regression, the two popular models in the literature and comparable to the Random Forest and XGBOOST model. CPU and RAM utilization were also monitored to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed work for real-world deployment. RAM utilization for the proposed model was higher by 30-45% compared to the other three models. Hence, the proposed model is resource-intensive as it has higher parameters than the other three models. Higher parameters also result in higher accuracy of predictions.","[Nerurkar, Pranav] NMIMS, Dept Data Sci, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Nerurkar, Pranav; Bhirud, Sunil; Patel, Dhiren] VJTI Mumbai, Dept CE, IT, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Ludinard, Romaric; Busnel, Yann] IMT Atlantique, SRCD Dept, Rennes, France; [Kumari, Saru] Chaudhary Charan Singh Univ, Dept Math, Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, India","SVKM's NMIMS (Deemed to be University); Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI); IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; IMT Atlantique; Chaudhary Charan Singh University","Kumari, S (corresponding author), Chaudhary Charan Singh Univ, Dept Math, Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, India.","saryusiirohi@gmail.com","Kumari, Saru/K-2038-2019","Kumari, Saru/0000-0003-4929-5383; Ludinard, Romaric/0000-0002-4997-4813; Busnel, Yann/0000-0001-6908-719X; nerurkar, pranav/0000-0002-9100-6437","","","","","55","8","8","2","18","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0924-669X","1573-7497","","APPL INTELL","Appl.

Insecure coding practices, the complexity of the task in hand, and usability issues, amongst other reasons, make it hard on software developers to maintain secure code. When it comes to cryptographic currencies, the need for assuring security is inevitable. For example, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer software system that is primarily used as digital money. There exist many software libraries supporting various programming languages that allow access to the Bitcoin system via an Application Programming Interface (API). APIs that are inappropriately used would lead to security vulnerabilities, which are hard to discover, resulting in many zero-day exploits. Making APIs usable is, therefore, an essential aspect related to the quality and robustness of the software. This paper surveys the general academic literature concerning API usability and usable security. Furthermore, it evaluates the API usability of Libbitcoin, a well-known C++ implementation of the Bitcoin system, and assesses how the findings of this evaluation could affect the applications that use Libbitcoin. For that purpose, the paper proposes two static analysis tools to further investigate the use of Libbitcoin APIs in open-source projects from a security usability perspective. The findings of this research have improved Libbitcoin in many places, as will be shown in this paper.","[Tschannen, Philipp] Univ Liverpool, Dept Comp Sci, Liverpool L69 7ZX, Merseyside, England; [Ahmed, Ali] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Engn & Comp Sci, Wellington 6140, New Zealand","University of Liverpool; Victoria University Wellington","Tschannen, P (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Dept Comp Sci, Liverpool L69 7ZX, Merseyside, England.;Ahmed, A (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Engn & Comp Sci, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.","philipp.tschannen@online.liverpool.ac.uk; ali.ahmed@vuw.ac.nz","","Ahmed, Ali/0000-0002-7370-3044","University of Liverpool","University of Liverpool","Open access funding provided by the University of Liverpool.","","155","0","0","1","4","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2079-9292","","ELECTRONICS-SWITZ","Electronics","JUL","2020","9","7","","","","","","","1077","10.3390/electronics9071077","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics9071077","","","36","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Physics","MS2XZ","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000554147000001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Applying the Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA), it is found that Bitcoin return series have distinctly different multifractal properties than of gold. Our evidence shows that all return and volatility series of Bitcoin have a persistent behavior, and have higher degree of multifractality than of gold. Using rolling windows approach, we confirm the persistence and the higher degree of multifractality of Bitcoin time series. Return series of gold have uncorrelated behavior while volatility series of gold have persistent behavior. Moreover, applying structural break test for the series of complexity parameters retrieved from the multifractal analysis of the return and volatility series of gold and Bitcoin, our results indicate that time series of gold have different regimes with different characteristics of multifractality. Furthermore, impact of temporal correlations and fat-tails is also examined and both are found to be the source of multifractality in the return series of Bitcoin and gold. In volatility series of Bitcoin, multifractality arises mostly due to long-range correlations and fat-tails. However, presence of long-range correlations and fat-tails in the original volatility series of gold mostly yields to less degree of multifractality. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Forecasting the Bitcoin price as accurate as possible is essential, but due to its high volatility this task is challenging. Many researchers try, through the years, to develop efficient models for predicting the Bitcoin price using several different data-driven approaches. The objective of this paper is to develop a novel decomposition-ensemble learning model that combines Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Stacking-ensemble learning (STACK) with machine learning algorithms to forecast the Bitcoin price multi-step ahead. The algorithms are k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regression with Linear kernel, Feed-forward Artificial Neural Network with single-layer perceptron, Generalized Linear Model, and Cubist. Correlation matrix (CORR), principal component analysis (PCA), and Box-Cox transformation (BOXCOX) were used as data preprocessing techniques. Estimating the performance of the proposed models (namely VMD STACK CORR, VMD STACK PCA, and VMD STACK BOXCOX) using relative root mean square error, symmetric mean absolute percentage error, and absolute percentage error measures, defined that for one-day-ahead forecast VMD STAK BOXCOX model presented the better performance, and for two and three-days-ahead forecast VMD STACK CORR model was chosen, compared to VMD, STACK, and machine learning algorithms models' performance. Diebold-Mariano statistical test was conducted to evaluate a reduction in forecasting errors. Therefore, the proposed models (VMD STACK CORR, VMD STACK PCA, and VMD STACK BOXCOX) indeed forecast accurately Bitcoin price and outperformed the compared models (VMD, STACK, and machine learning models).","[da Silva, Ramon Gomes; Ribeiro, Matheus Henrique Dal Molin; Coelho, Leandro dos Santos] Pontifical Catholic Univ Parana PUCPR, Ind & Syst Engn Grad Program PPGEPS, BR-80215901 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Ribeiro, Matheus Henrique Dal Molin] Fed Technol Univ Parana UTFPR, Dept Math, BR-85503390 Pato Branco, Parana, Brazil; [Fraccanabbia, Naylene; Mariani, Viviana Cocco] Pontifical Catholic Univ Parana PUCPR, Mech Engn Grad Program PPGEM, BR-80215901 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Mariani, Viviana Cocco; Coelho, Leandro dos Santos] Fed Univ Parana UFPR, Dept Elect Engn, BR-81530000 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil","Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana; Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Parana; Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana; Universidade Federal do Parana","da Silva, RG (corresponding author), Pontifical Catholic Univ Parana PUCPR, Ind & Syst Engn Grad Program PPGEPS, BR-80215901 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.","gomes.ramon@pucpr.edu.br; matheus.dalmolinribeiro@gmail.com; nayfraccanabbia@outlook.com; viviana.mariani@pucpr.br; leandro.coelho@pucpr.br","; Coelho, Leandro/G-8213-2014; Mariani, Viviana Cocco/N-5634-2016","Gomes da Silva, Ramon/0000-0001-8580-7695; Coelho, Leandro/0000-0001-5728-943X; Mariani, Viviana Cocco/0000-0003-2490-4568","National Council of Scientific and Technologic Development of Brazil - CNPq [307958/2019-1-PQ, 307966/2019-4-PQ, 404659/2016-0-Univ, 405101/2016-3-Univ]; PRONEX 'Fundacao Araucaria' [042/2018]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) [001]","National Council of Scientific and Technologic Development of Brazil - CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); PRONEX 'Fundacao Araucaria'(Fundacao Araucaria de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico do Estado do Parana FA); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES))","The authors would like to thank the National Council of Scientific and Technologic Development of Brazil - CNPq (Grants number: 307958/2019-1-PQ, 307966/2019-4-PQ, 404659/2016-0-Univ, 405101/2016-3-Univ), PRONEX `Fundacao Araucaria' 042/2018, and Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001 for financial support of this work.","","39","0","0","1","6","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2161-4393","","978-1-7281-6926-2","IEEE IJCNN","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BQ9MM","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000626021404058","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Bitcoin works in a peer-to-peer framework with no third party acting as a monitoring agency. This brings in both positive and negative spirit to the table. Though generic understanding is available, the studies done on bitcoin and blockchain are far and few. The purpose of this paper is to decipher the level of understanding the scientific world has on bitcoin and the underlying blockchain and thereby to find out the pertinent research gaps existing in this field. Design/methodology/approach A biblio-morphological analysis is undertaken which underscores a comprehensive framework characterizing the bitcoin and blockchain literature in terms of dimensions and options. This was developed as a result of extensive scanning of the relevant literature. Findings The biblio-morphological analysis broadly outlines the present status of the research on the topic. The morphological analysis brings out the 169 research gaps that exist in the area of bitcoin and underlying blockchain technology. The cross-consistency matrix underscores the fact that this novel technology bears large research potential. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is a first comprehensive biblio-morphological analysis on bitcoin and underlying blockchain technology, which characterizes blockchain literature and thereby offers to reduce redundant research by delineating the possible avenues in the area of blockchain technology.","[Issac, Abraham Cyril] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Management Studies, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; [Issac, Abraham Cyril] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Business & Law, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Baral, Rupashree] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Management Studies, Human Resource Management & Org Behav, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras; Swinburne University of Technology; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras","Issac, AC (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Management Studies, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.;Issac, AC (corresponding author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Business & Law, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.","yourcyril@gmail.com; rupashree@iitm.ac.in","Issac, Abraham Cyril/AAR-6019-2020","Issac, Abraham Cyril/0000-0001-6693-068X; Baral, Rupashree/0000-0002-7258-0476","","","","","50","5","5","2","8","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","2514-9342","2514-9350","","GLOB KNOWL MEM COMMU","Glob.

However, how do logics of action emerge in a nascent field of market activity that lacks these types of institutions? To answer this question, I draw on theories of institutions and markets to examine the experiences of 23 adopters of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin during 2015 to 2016. Utilizing an iterative combination of correspondence analysis (CA) techniques and narrative analysis, I show how Bitcoin adoption was motivated by competing value frameworks that corresponded to different user types in the system. This resulted in the emergence novel extra-institutional logics that supported the growth of Bitcoin as a whole despite being centered on different visions for the future of the system. These logics provide a unique glimpse into how Bitcoin was able to survive during a period of notable instability preceding a historic market bubble. This article provides support for dynamic theories of markets and demonstrates how logics of action are tethered to the characteristics of the fields in which they emerge.","[Kinney, Alexander B.] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ USA","University of Arizona","Kinney, AB (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Social Sci 400, POB 210027, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.","abk5074@email.arizona.edu","","Kinney, Alexander/0000-0003-2916-1791","","","","","77","1","1","1","9","SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","THOUSAND OAKS","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","2329-4965","2329-4973","","SOC CURR","Soc.

We explore the long-term relationship between USDI and Bitcoin by estimating a Markov-switching autoregressive (MS-AR) model with two regimes. Thus, the data used cover the period from 18 January 2010 to 30 June 2017 for both USDI and Bitcoin. The empirical findings based on the analysis of the MS-AR model report that investing in Bitcoin involves more benefits than USDI even if the economy is in a recession. However, by examining Bitcoin and USDI volatility, the research findings underline positive dependency between the two. Such results denote that Bitcoin does not act as a hedge, and not even as a safe haven, against USDI. We found that Bitcoin is merely a diversifier for USDI.

We find significant bidirectional causality between Bitcoin and all altcoins and assets considered in the two distribution tails. An enhanced forecast of Bitcoin price returns is thus derived by conditioning on altcoins or assets and vice versa during extreme market conditions. However, under normal market conditions the results for the centre of the distribution of the Bitcoin price returns conditional on altcoins depend on both the altcoin considered and quantile under investigation. We also find evidence that Bitcoin is not isolated from financial markets, while this developing financial asset is a strong safe-haven for oil and a weak safe-haven for S&P500, but it cannot be considered as either a weak or strong safe-haven for gold.

The intraday price variability is proxied by four different measures, namely realized variance, jump variation, downside realized semivariance, and negative signed jump variation. The empirical analysis suggests that all realized volatility proxies have a significant and negative contemporaneous relation with Bitcoin returns. On the other hand, there is weak evidence of a negative intertemporal relation between returns and realized variance, jump variation, and downside realized semivariance. Accordingly, the existence of a positive risk-return trade-off in Bitcoin markets seems to be unsubstantiated. The findings are robust, even after controlling for a number of relevant determinants of the price formation process of Bitcoin.","[Ahmed, Walid M.

In addition, implied volatility indices (30, 60- and 90-days) of BTCUSD and the Cyptocurrency Index (CRIX) are generated by making use of the symmetric GARCH option pricing model. The results indicate that the GARCH option pricing model produces accurate European option prices when compared to market prices and that the BTCUSD and CRIX implied volatility indices are similar when compared, this is consistent with expectations because BTCUSD is highly weighted when calculating the CRIX. Furthermore, the term structure of volatility indices indicate that short-term volatility (30 days) is generally lower when compared to longer maturities. Furthermore, short-term volatility tends to increase to higher levels when compared to 60 and 90 day volatility when large jumps occur in the underlying asset.","[Venter, Pierre J.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Actuarial Sci, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa; [Venter, Pierre J.] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Finance & Investment Management, POB 524, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa; [Mare, Eben] Univ Pretoria, Dept Math & Appl Math, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa","University of Pretoria; University of Johannesburg; University of Pretoria","Venter, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Actuarial Sci, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa.;Venter, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Dept Finance & Investment Management, POB 524, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa.;Mare, E (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Math & Appl Math, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa.","venter.pierre7@gmail.com; eben.mare@up.ac.za","; Mare, Eben/D-9752-2018","Venter, Pierre/0000-0001-7304-5806; Mare, Eben/0000-0001-5966-3296","","","","","34","4","4","1","4","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

While some of the proposed models are univariate, the other models are multivariate and as a result, the maximum, minimum and the opening daily price of Bitcoin are also used in these models. The proposed models are applied on the Bitcoin price from December 18, 2019 to March 1, 2020 and their performances are compared in terms of the performance measures of RMSE and MAPE by Diebold-Mariano statistical test.

At a first glance, such a property seems to be easily provided by using conventional threshold encryption. However, this idea cannot be straight-forwardly implemented since key pairs for an encryption mechanism is additionally required. In this paper, we propose a new threshold encryption scheme in which key pairs for ECDSA that are already used in the Bitcoin protocol can be directly used as they are. Namely, a unique key pair can be simultaneously used for both ECDSA and our threshold encryption scheme without losing security. Furthermore, we implemented our scheme on the Bitcoin regtest network, and show that it is fairly practical. For example, the execution time of the encryption algorithm Enc (resp., the threshold decryption algorithm Dec) is 0.2 sec. (resp., 0.3 sec.), and the total time is just only 3 sec. including all the cryptographic processes and network communications for a typical parameter setting. Also, we discuss several applications of our threshold encryption scheme in detail: Claiming priority of intellectual property, sealed-bid auction, lottery, and coin tossing service.","[Hanaoka, Goichiro; Sakai, Yusuke; Shin, SeongHan] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Tokyo 1350064, Japan; [Shimizu, Toshiya] Fujitsu Labs Ltd, Res Informat Secur, Kashiwa, Chiba 2118588, Japan; [Shimoyama, Takeshi] Fujitsu Labs Ltd, Kashiwa, Chiba 2118588, Japan","National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST); Fujitsu Ltd; Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd; Fujitsu Ltd; Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd","Shin, S (corresponding author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Tokyo 1350064, Japan.","seonghan.shin@aist.go.jp","","","","","","","31","0","0","1","7","IEICE-INST ELECTRONICS INFORMATION COMMUNICATIONS ENG","TOKYO","KIKAI-SHINKO-KAIKAN BLDG, 3-5-8, SHIBA-KOEN, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-0011, JAPAN","0916-8508","1745-1337","","IEICE T FUND ELECTR","IEICE Trans.

Sliding window is used to obtain point cloud datasets from a multidimensional time series (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple). We apply persistent homology to quantify transient loops that appear in multiscale topological spaces, which associated on each point cloud dataset and encode the quantified information in a persistence landscape. Temporal changes in persistence landscapes are measured via their L-1-norms. Consequently, a new representative is attained, called L-1-norms time series. The L-1-norms is associated with indicators: autocorrelation function at lag 1, variance and mean power spectrum at low frequencies to detect the signals. By using Kendall's tau correlation and significance test, significant rising trend events that occur before major financial crashes in Bitcoin are defined as the signals. A threshold is determined to scan entire data and record all the significant rising trend events. Lastly, we compare L-1-norms with residuals time series, which is another representative obtained from de-trending approach. Our result portrays that autocorrelation function at lag 1 and variance of the L-1-norms successfully detect early warning signals before the 2017 and 2019 major financial crashes. However, variance of the L-1-norms is better since it able to signal another 2018 major financial crash. For the residuals, no early warning signals are detected. Hence, persistent homology provides a better representative than de-trending approach.

A typical offer will suggest that, for a small fee, one could receive within minutes twice the amount of bitcoins submitted. BGS is clearly not a very sophisticated attack. The modus operandi is simply to put up some web page on which to find the address to send the money and wait for the payback. The pages are then indexed by search engines, and ready to find for victims looking for free bitcoins. We describe here a generic system to find and analyze scams such as BGS. We have trained a classifier to detect these pages, and we have a crawler searching for instances using a series of search engines. We then monitor the instances that we find to trace payments and bitcoin addresses that are being used over time. Unlike most bitcoin-based scam monitoring systems, we do not rely on analyzing transactions on the blockchain to find scam instances. Instead, we proactively find these instances through the web pages advertising the scam. Thus our system is able to find addresses with very few transactions, or even none at all. Indeed, over half of the addresses that have eventually received funds were detected before receiving any transactions. The data for this paper was collected over four months, from November 2019 to February 2020. We have found more than 1,300 addresses directly associated with the scam, hosted on over 500 domains. Overall, these addresses have received (at least) over 5 million USD to the scam, with an average of 47.3 USD per transaction.","[Badawi, Emad; Jourdan, Guy-Vincent; Bochmann, Gregor] Univ Ottawa, Fac Engn, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Onut, Iosif-Viorel] IBM Ctr Adv Studies, Ottawa, ON, Canada","University of Ottawa","Badawi, E (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Fac Engn, Ottawa, ON, Canada.","ebada090@uottawa.ca; gjourdan@uottawa.ca; Bochmann@uottawa.ca; vioonut@ca.ibm.com","","Badawi, Emad/0000-0001-9336-8012","Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council","Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","This work was supported in part by Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council.

The aim of this paper consists in analyzing some stochastic models of fat-tail returns and risk models. The evidence of fat-tailed returns distribution for the BCH data is investigated, by performing a statistical analysis of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) in the U.S. dollar. By using daily Close, Open, Low, and High returns of BCH data series, the monthly-divided daily returns study describes further properties such as skewness, kurtosis, and correlation analysis. The results obtained prove that variance gamma distribution best fit the close, open and low returns, where high returns follow the generalized hyperbolic distribution. In addition, for the best-fitted fat-tailed returns distributions, several risk measures such as volatility, Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall measures are computed, analyzed and compared.","[Sheraz, Muhammad] Inst Business Adm Karachi, Dept Math Sci, Karachi, Pakistan; [Dedu, Silvia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Appl Math, Bucharest, Romania","Institute of Business Administration, Karachi; Bucharest University of Economic Studies","Sheraz, MHM (corresponding author), Inst Business Adm Karachi, Dept Math Sci, Karachi, Pakistan.","msheraz@iba.edu.pk; silvia.dedu@csie.ase.ro","Dedu, Silvia/AFP-3662-2022; Dedu, Silvia/C-6923-2012","Dedu, Silvia/0000-0001-7195-0941","","","","","22","3","3","1","7","ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES","BUCHAREST","15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA","0424-267X","1842-3264","","ECON COMPUT ECON CYB","Econ.

Given Bitcoin's growing real-life deployment and popularity, its security has aroused more and more attention in both financial and information industries. As a body containing a variety of cryptosystems, Bitcoin may also suffer from cryptanalysis attacks. This paper focuses on one of such attacks: the Trojan message attack, and presents in detail how to conduct the attack according to the structure and workflow of the Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash protocol of Bitcoin. The attack aims at forging an upcoming transaction record and results from the fact that all users' candidate input transactions are open to the attacker. The construction of the attack employs a combination of the Bitcoin transaction structure with standard Merkle-Damgard extension vulnerabilities. The conclusion of the attack shows that both the mathematical structure of the hash function itself and the public information in the blockchain are important to the security of Bitcoin. These factors should be considered in the future for the design of other cryptocurrency and blockchain systems.","[Wang, Maoning; Duan, Meijiao; Zhu, Jianming] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Informat, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Maoning] Shanghai Key Lab Integrated Adm Technol Informat, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Wang, Maoning] Southeast Univ, Key Lab Comp Network & Informat Integrat, Minist Educ, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China; [Wang, Maoning] Hunan Prov Base Int Sci & Technol Innovat & Coope, Changsha 410205, Peoples R China","Central University of Finance & Economics; Southeast University - China","Wang, MN (corresponding author), Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Informat, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Wang, MN (corresponding author), Shanghai Key Lab Integrated Adm Technol Informat, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.;Wang, MN (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Key Lab Comp Network & Informat Integrat, Minist Educ, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China.;Wang, MN (corresponding author), Hunan Prov Base Int Sci & Technol Innovat & Coope, Changsha 410205, Peoples R China.","13854139297@139.com","","","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB1400700]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [4194090]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61702570, U1509214]; Opening Project of Shanghai Key Laboratory of Integrated Administration Technologies for Information Security [AGK2018005]; Opening Project of Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration (Southeast University) [K93-9-2018-05]; Open Fund of Key Laboratory of Hunan Province [2017TP1026]","National Key R&D Program of China; Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Opening Project of Shanghai Key Laboratory of Integrated Administration Technologies for Information Security; Opening Project of Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration (Southeast University); Open Fund of Key Laboratory of Hunan Province","The work is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant No. 2017YFB1400700, Beijing Natural Science Foundation under Grant No. 4194090, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61702570, U1509214, the Opening Project of Shanghai Key Laboratory of Integrated Administration Technologies for Information Security under Grant No. AGK2018005, the Opening Project of Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration (Southeast University) under Grant No. K93-9-2018-05, and Open Fund of Key Laboratory of Hunan Province (2017TP1026).","","31","0","0","0","2","SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD","SINGAPORE","152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE","1865-0929","1865-0937","978-981-15-3278-8; 978-981-15-3277-1","COMM COM INF SC","","","2020","1176","","","","","","196","209","","10.1007/978-981-15-3278-8_13","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-3278-8_13","","","14","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR9ZL","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000680423400013","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this paper, we analyse the structure of the BLN over a period of 18 months, ranging from 12th January 2018 to 17th July 2019, at the end of which the network has reached 8.216 users, 122.517 active channels and 2.732,5 transacted Bitcoins. Here, we consider three representations of the BLN: thedaily snapshotone, theweekly snapshotone and thedaily-block snapshotone. By studying the topological properties of the binary and weighted versions of the three representations above, we find that the total volume of transacted Bitcoins approximately grows as the square of the network size; however, despite the huge activity characterising the BLN, the Bitcoins distribution is very unequal: the average Gini coefficient of the node strengths (computed across the entire history of the Bitcoin lightning network) is, in fact, similar or equal to 0.88 causing the 10% (50%) of the nodes to hold the 80% (99%) of the Bitcoins at stake in the BLN (on average, across the entire period). This concentration brings up the question of which minimalist network model allows us to explain the network topological structure. Like for other economic systems, we hypothesise that local properties of nodes, like the degree, ultimately determine part of its characteristics. Therefore, we have tested the goodness of the undirected binary configuration model (UBCM) in reproducing the structural features of the BLN: the UBCM recovers the disassortative and the hierarchical character of the BLN but underestimates the centrality of nodes; this suggests that the BLN is becoming an increasingly centralised network, more and more compatible with a core-periphery structure. Further inspection of the resilience of the BLN shows that removing hubs leads to the collapse of the network into many components, an evidence suggesting that this network may be a target for the so-calledsplit attacks.","[Lin, Jian-Hong; Tessone, Claudio J.] Univ Zurich, URPP Social Networks, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Lin, Jian-Hong] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Scheuchzerstr 7, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Primicerio, Kevin] Univ Paris Saclay, Cent Supelec, Math & Informat Complexite & Syst, FR-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Squartini, Tiziano] IMT Sch Adv Studies Lucca, Piazza San Francesco 19, I-55100 Lucca, Italy; [Decker, Christian] Blockstream Corp Inc, Montreal, PQ H4M 2X6, Canada; [Lin, Jian-Hong; Tessone, Claudio J.] Univ Zurich, UZH Blockchain Ctr, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland","University of Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca; University of Zurich","Decker, C (corresponding author), Blockstream Corp Inc, Montreal, PQ H4M 2X6, Canada.","tiziano.squartini@imtlucca.it","","Tessone, Claudio J./0000-0001-7733-6221","China Scholarship Council [2017083010177]; University of Zurich through the University Research Priority Programme on Social Networks","China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); University of Zurich through the University Research Priority Programme on Social Networks","J-HL acknowledges support from the China Scholarship Council (No 2017083010177).

EPU is measured in terms of economic policy, monetary policy, financial regulation, taxation policy, and the news-based policy uncertainty index for the U.S., U.K., Europe and Japan. By applying a variety of statistical techniques (multivariate EWMA models, Spearman's rho, the Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) spill-over index, GAS models with conditional multivariate Student-t distribution and time-varying scales and correlations, BVAR models with the Litterman/Minnesota priors and nonlinear impulse responses with local projections accounting for different regimes in uncertainty) we estimate interdependence between traditional financial and Bitcoin markets and their reaction to the selected policy shocks. Our findings indicate the investment attractiveness of bitcoin as a hedging tool against shocks in uncertainty in the USA economic policy. The results are significant and potentially useful to researchers, practitioners, and Bitcoin market participants to better understand the nature of Bitcoin and facilitate better portfolio and risk-management decisions.

We focus on Asia because it is one of the fastest-growing regions worldwide, where cryptocurrencies are actively traded. A wavelet transform technique is combined with a multivariate factor stochastic volatility (SV) model to examine the dynamic correlation properties and risk reduction effectiveness of BTC in both the time and frequency domains. We use gold and oil as benchmarks and compared their results with those of BTC. The estimated correlations indicate that the Asian currencies tend to be negatively correlated with BTC; therefore, the latter could provide a hedge against the former over the medium (8-32 days) and long (32-64 days) terms. By contrast, Asian currencies tend to be positively correlated with oil and gold for the same horizons. We also analyze the downside risk reduction effectiveness of BTC for the portfolio of Asian currencies and find that BTC provides better risk reduction than oil and gold, particularly over the medium and long terms. This study makes significant contributions to the literature by demonstrating that the correlation properties and risk reduction effectiveness of BTC differ depending on the investment horizons. We believe our findings using the wavelet-based SV model can help heterogeneous investors detect portfolio risks and thus, identify optimal hedging strategies over various investment horizons.","[Kinkyo, Takuji] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan","Kobe University","Kinkyo, T (corresponding author), Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.","kinkyo@econ.kobe-u.ac.jp","Kinkyo, Takuji/GLU-0004-2022","Kinkyo, Takuji/0000-0002-0053-2328","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [18K01610]","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Grant/Award Number: 18K01610","","31","1","1","2","9","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1076-9307","1099-1158","","INT J FINANC ECON","Int.

Later we use VaR, CoVaR and Delta CoVaR tests to measure risk spillover and resulting asymmetries. Our results contribute towards the existing literature by reporting the hedging ability of gold for Bitcoin and the effect that have on precious metal returns. In this way our results provide insights in both the direction. Our results also document spillover from Bitcoin to precious metal market however in terms of directional spillover from precious metals to Bitcoin, silver remains insensitive to any downside risk spillover. We also report asymmetries in upside and downside CoVaR values, suggesting that extreme changes in returns in either of the market has the potential to affect extreme returns in the other market. Our results have implications for individual investor and fund managers in formulating an optimal portfolio yielding returns with hedge against extreme downward price movements.","[Rehman, Mobeen Ur] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Informetr Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Rehman, Mobeen Ur] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","Ton Duc Thang University; Ton Duc Thang University","Rehman, MU (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Informetr Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.","Mobeen@tdtu.edu.vn","Rehman, Mobeen Ur/B-4368-2017","Rehman, Mobeen Ur/0000-0002-8889-9051","","","","","51","14","14","1","21","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0301-4207","1873-7641","","RESOUR POLICY","Resour.

Thereafter, all the major oil markets have become extremely volatile, and investments in these markets could lead to substantial losses. This paper empirically investigates the time-varying correlations between gold and oil markets to examine whether gold is a safe haven asset for the international crude oil markets during the COVID-19 period. For the purpose of comparison, the safe haven property of Bitcoin is tested as well. The results of the time-varying correlations obtained through the DCC-GARCH model suggest that gold is a safe haven asset for global crude oil markets. Bitcoin, on the other hand, acts only as a diversifier for crude oil. The results further show that the portfolio risk is minimized when investors include oil and gold in their portfolio rather than holding assets in oil and Bitcoin markets. Given that financial downturn, terrorist attacks, pandemics and similar global events often play a crucial role in portfolio risk analysis, our results could be of interest to those who invest in oil, gold and Bitcoin markets.","[Dutta, Anupam] Univ Vaasa, Sch Accounting & Finance, Vaasa, Finland; [Dutta, Anupam; Xuan Vinh Vo] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Inst Business Res, 59C Nguyen Dinh Chieu St,Dist 3, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Das, Debojyoti] Woxsen Sch Business, Hyderabad 502345, TS, India; [Jana, R.

For this, we use several copula models: Gaussian, Student-t, Clayton, Gumbel, and Frank. The analysis period runs from August 18, 2011 to June 31, 2019. We found that the Gaussian and Student-t copulas are best at fitting the structure dependence between markets. Also, these copulas suggest that under normal market conditions, Bitcoin might act as a hedge asset against the stock price movements of all international markets analyzed. However, the dependence on the Shanghai and Hong Kong markets was somewhat higher. Also, under extreme market conditions, the role of Bitcoin might change from hedge to diversifier. In a time-varying copula analysis, given by the Student-t copula, we found that even under normal market conditions, for some markets, the role of Bitcoin as a hedge asset might fail on a high number of days.","[Garcia-Jorcano, Laura] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales, Dept Econ Anal & Finance, Cobertizo San Pedro Martir S-N, Toledo, Spain; [Benito, Sonia] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ Anal, Senda Rey 11, Madrid 28040, Spain","Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED)","Benito, S (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ Anal, Senda Rey 11, Madrid 28040, Spain.","Laura.Garcia@uclm.es; soniabm@cee.uned.es","Garcia-Jorcano, Laura/AAA-7068-2022","Garcia-Jorcano, Laura/0000-0002-3656-8787; Benito, Sonia/0000-0001-9409-0868","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2015-67305-P]","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government)","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the grant Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadECO2015-67305-P.","","77","18","18","1","10","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0275-5319","1878-3384","","RES INT BUS FINANC","Res.

This strategy could be used by a colluding pool of miners to earn more than their fair share of the mining revenue and in consequence to force other honest miners to join them to decrease the variance of their revenues and make their monthly revenues more predictable. It is a very dangerous dynamic that could allow the rogue pool of miners to go toward a majority by accumulating powers of news adherents and control the entire network. Considering that the propagation delay of information between any two miners in the network, which is not negligible and follows a normal distribution with mean proportional to the physical distance between the two miners, and a constant variance independent of others' delays, we prove that no guarantee can be given about the success or failure of the selfish-mine attack because of the variability of information propagation in the network.","[Moustapha, B.

The purpose of our study is to comparatively evaluate a plethora of Artificial Intelligence systems in forecasting high frequency Bitcoin price series. We employ three different sets of models, i.e., statistical machine learning approaches including support vector regressions (SVR) and Gaussian Poisson regressions (GRP), algorithmic models such as regression trees (RT) and the k-nearest neighbours (kNN) and finally artificial neural network topologies such as feedforward (FFNN), Bayesian regularization (BRNN) and radial basis function networks (RBFNN). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an extensive empirical investigation of the comparative predictability of various machine learning models is implemented in high-frequency trading of Bitcoin. The entropy analysis of training and testing samples reveals long memory traits, high levels of stochasticity, and topological complexity. The presence of inherent nonlinear dynamics of Bitcoin time series fully rationalizes the use of advanced machines learning techniques. The optimal parameter values for SVR, GRP and kNN are found via Bayesian optimization. Based on diverse performance metrics, our results show that the BRNN renders an outstanding accuracy in forecasting, while its convergence is unhindered and remarkably fast. The overall superiority of artificial neural networks is due to parallel processing features that efficiently emulate human decision-making in the presence of underlying nonlinear input-output relationships in noisy signal environments.

We give a new derivation of the stationary distribution of the process in the honest mining case and further build on the results of Gobel et al.([)(8)(]) by showing that the normalizing constant can be expressed in closed-form. We also use similar techniques to derive expressions for the Laplace transforms of the transition functions. We then illustrate how these techniques yield similar expressions for the stationary distribution of the process when the smaller pool implements Selfish Mining: the Laplace transforms of the transition functions can be calculated as well. Lastly, we briefly explain how our methods can be extended to more general models of a similar type.","Clemson Univ, Sch Math & Stat Sci, Clemson, SC USA; Clemson Univ, CORI, Clemson, SC USA","Clemson University; Clemson University","Fralix, B (corresponding author), Sch Math & Stat Sci, O-110 Martin Hall,Box 340975, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.","bfralix@clemson.edu","","","","","","","21","3","3","0","7","TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC","PHILADELPHIA","530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA","1532-6349","1532-4214","","STOCH MODELS","Stoch.

Asset pricing is a risky and challenging activity that enchants lots of shareholders. Indeed, the difficulty in making predictions lies in understanding the multiple factors that affect the Bitcoin price trend. Modeling the market behavior and thus, the sentiment in the Bitcoin ecosystem provides an insight into the predictions of the Bitcoin price. While there are significant studies that investigate the token economics based on the Bitcoin network, limited research has been performed to analyze the network sentiment on the overall Bitcoin price. In this paper, we investigate the predictive power of network sentiments and explore statistical and deep-learning methods to predict Bitcoin future price. In particular, we analyze financial and sentiment features extracted from economic and crowd-sourced data respectively, and we show how the sentiment is the most significant factor in predicting Bitcoin market stocks. Next, we compare two models used for Bitcoin time-series predictions: the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous input (ARIMAX) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We demonstrate that both models achieve optimal results on new predictions, with a mean squared error lower than 0.14%, due to the inclusion of the studied sentiment feature. Besides, since the ARIMAX achieves better predictions than the RNN, we also prove that, with just a linear model, we may obtain outstanding market forecasts in the Bitcoin scenario.","[Serafini, Giulia; Yi, Ping] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Serafini, Giulia; Brambilla, Marco] Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy; [Zhang, Qingquan] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL USA; [Wang, Jiayue] Beijing Int Studies Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yiwei] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Li, Beibei] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Polytechnic University of Milan; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Beijing International Studies University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Carnegie Mellon University","Yi, P (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.","yiping@sjtu.edu.cn","Brambilla, Marco/M-4748-2015","Brambilla, Marco/0000-0002-8753-2434","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFB1405000]","National Key Research and Development Program of China","The work is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No.2019YFB1405000).","","34","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2161-4393","","978-1-7281-6926-2","IEEE IJCNN","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BQ9MM","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000626021401002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This information can enter into the market either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The financial literature shows that Bitcoin market volatility is symmetrically informative and has a long memory to persist in the future. Additionally, the symmetricity of volatility has been revealed to be of greater sensitivity to its past values compared to the new shock of the market values. This study therefore applied the symmetric volatility structure of Bitcoin currency which can be measured through four input attributes such as open price (OP), high price (HP), low price (LP), and close price (CP) for predicting its price future trend. The study uses Rapid-Miner programme based on artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. The optimal model employs a multilayer neural network (NN) along with an optimised operator with the ability to locate the optimal factor loading of the applied algorithm. The findings indicate that ANN is an effective and adequate model for correctly predicting Bitcoin market prices using symmetric volatility attributes with accuracy level of 92.15% against the actual price, whereas the low price attribute is found to be the major promoter for Bitcoin price trend with percentage of 63%. This is followed by close price, high price, and open price with percentages of 49%, 46%, and 37%, respectively. The findings of the study therefore would be a valuable and significant input for commercial purposes among the cryptocurrency market players. In other worlds, based on these outcomes investors will proactively predicate the Bitcoin price trend and make the right investment decision either to buy, hold, or sale to gain up normal market return. This is considered a pioneering study that predicates the Bitcoin price trend based on its symmetric volatility structure. As these replication findings demonstrate, the proposed model is highly promising and applicable in a real-time trading system for predicting Bitcoin price future trend and maximising investment profits in Cryptocurrency markets.","[Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah; Kassim, Salina; Bin Rosman, Romzie; Redzuan, Nur Harena Binti] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, IIiBF, POB 10, Kuala Lumpur 50728, Malaysia","International Islamic University Malaysia","Othman, AHA (corresponding author), Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, IIiBF, POB 10, Kuala Lumpur 50728, Malaysia.","anwarhasan@iium.edu.my; ksalina@iium.edu.my; romzie@iium.edu.my; nurharena@iium.edu.my","Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah/U-3214-2019; Kassim, Salina/Q-7008-2019","Othman, Anwar Hasan Abdullah/0000-0001-5759-8216; Kassim, Salina/0000-0002-7514-8750; Rosman, Romzie/0000-0003-2066-5897","","","","","32","6","6","0","7","PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD","BASINGSTOKE","BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND","1476-6930","1477-657X","","J REVENUE PRICING MA","J.

The flow is attributable to one entity, clusters below round prices, induces asymmetric autocorrelations in Bitcoin, and suggests insufficient Tether reserves before month-ends.

In order to test these algorithms, besides existing continuous dataset, discrete dataset was also created and used. For the evaluations of algorithm performances, the F statistic, accuracy statistic, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Root Absolute Error (RAE) metrics were used. The t test was used to compare the performances of the SVM, ANN, NB and RF with the performance of the LR. Empirical findings reveal that, while the RF has the highest forecasting performance in the continuous dataset, the NB has the lowest. On the other hand, while the ANN has the highest and the NB the lowest performance in the discrete dataset.

A BTC transaction (tx) needs six confirmations (one hour) to be validated, making it not suitable for fast-pay scenarios. Theoretically, a shorter waiting time period increases the success possibility of a double-spending attack. To address this problem, we propose BTCFast scheme to support fast BTC tx. BTCFast is a novel, decentralized, escrow-based scheme on top of the programmable smart contract (PSC)-enabled blockchains (e.g. Ethereum, EOS). We develop a smart contract (PayJudger) to work as a trusted payment judger, which guarantees the tx fairness. In addition, we devise a proof-of-work (PoW)-based payment judgment mechanism for PayJudger to resolve a BTC payment dispute. Our theoretical and experimental results show that BTCFast can reduce the waiting time to be less than 1 second with comparable security as the current approach (i.e., waiting for six confirmations) with no extra operation fee.","[Lei, Xinyu; Xie, Tian; Tu, Guan-Hua] Michigan State Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Liu, Alex X.] Ant Financial Serv Grp, Hangzhou, Peoples R China","Michigan State University","Lei, XY (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.","leixinyu@msu.edu; xietian1@msu.edu; ghtu@msu.edu; xiangyangalex.lxy@antfin.com","","Tu, Guan-Hua/0000-0002-2542-4817","","","","","6","0","0","0","1","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","1063-6927","","978-1-7281-7002-2","INT CON DISTR COMP S","","","2020","","","","","","","1201","1202","","10.1109/ICDCS47774.2020.00148","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS47774.2020.00148","","","2","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR7JC","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000667971400123","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We use the tools of probabilistic analysis and Markov chains, and show that churn of relay nodes has a higher impact on traffic performance than that of ordinary nodes. We introduce two different Continuous Time Markov chains (CTMC) for ordinary and relay nodes to model each type of node's behavior separately. Our results indicate that node sleep impacts the performance more in networks where the proportion of relay nodes is lower, and also that block and transaction delivery times are higher in those cases. Also, we find that the time needed for a node to synchronize upon rejoining the network after sleep is dominated by the time required for block and transaction verification.","[Motlagh, Saeideh G.; Misic, Jelena; Misic, Vojislav B.] Ryerson Univ, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON, Canada","Toronto Metropolitan University","Misic, VB (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON, Canada.","vmisic@ryerson.ca","","G.

Multifractal scaling cannot be assumed, it should be established; however, this is not a straightforward task, particularly in the presence of heavy tails. We develop an empirical hypothesis test to identify whether a time series is likely to exhibit multifractal scaling in the presence of heavy tails. The test is constructed by comparing estimated scaling functions of financial time series to simulated scaling functions of both an iid Studentt-distributed process and a Brownian Motion in Multifractal Time (BMMT), a multifractal processes constructed in Mandelbrot et al. (1997). Concavity measures of the respective scaling functions are estimated, and it is observed that the concavity measures form different distributions which allow us to construct a hypothesis test. We apply this method to test for multifractal scaling across several financial time series including Bitcoin.

We then extend the HAR-RV model to include a metric of US-China trade tensions. This is our primary forecasting variable of interest, and it is based on Google Trends. We also control for jumps, realized skewness, and realized kurtosis. For our empirical analysis, we use a machine-learning technique that is known as random forests. Our findings reveal that US-China trade uncertainty does improve forecast accuracy for various configurations of random forests and forecast horizons.","[Bouri, Elie] Holy Spirit Univ Kaslik, USEK Business Sch, Jounieh, Lebanon; [Gkillas, Konstantinos] Univ Patras, Dept Business Adm, Univ Campus,POB 1391, Patras 26500, Greece; [Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Pierdzioch, Christian] Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Econ, Holstenhofweg 85,POB 700822, D-22008 Hamburg, Germany","University of Patras; University of Pretoria; Helmut Schmidt University","Gkillas, K (corresponding author), Univ Patras, Dept Business Adm, Univ Campus,POB 1391, Patras 26500, Greece.","eliebouri@usek.edu.lb; gillask@upatras.gr; rangan.gupta@up.ac.za; macroeconomics@hsu-hh.de","Bouri, Elie/N-1368-2015; Bouri, Elie/ABC-4197-2020","Bouri, Elie/0000-0003-2628-5027; Bouri, Elie/0000-0003-2628-5027","German Science Foundation [275693836]","German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG))","Funding was provided by German Science Foundation (Grant No. 275693836).","","65","18","18","2","19","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0927-7099","1572-9974","","COMPUT ECON","Comput.

At the same time, we thwart malicious user behavior such as double-redeeming attempts where a user tries to obtain rewards for multiple submissions of the same data. More importantly, we ensure the fairness of the exchange; by relying on the Blockchain, we eliminate the trust placed on third parties in traditional fair exchange protocols. Finally, our system is highly efficient as most of the protocol steps do not utilize the Blockchain network.

However, it is non-trivial for a common user who runs a light node to fetch historical transactions, since it only stores headers without any transaction details. It usually has to request a full node who stores the complete data. Validation of these query results is critical and mainly involves two aspects: correctness and completeness. The former can be implemented via Merkle branch easily, while the latter is quite difficult in the Bitcoin protocol. To enable the completeness validation, a strawman design is proposed, which simply includes the BF (Bloom filter) in the headers. However, since the size of BF is about KB, light nodes in the strawman will suffer from the incremental storage burden. What's worse, an integrated block must be transmitted when BF cannot work, resulting in large network overhead. In this paper, we propose LVQ, the first lightweight verifiable query approach that reduces the storage requirement and network overhead at the same time. To be specific, by only storing the hash of BF in headers, LVQ keeps data stored by light nodes being little. Besides, LVQ introduces a novel BMT (BF integrated Merkle Tree) structure for lightweight query, which can eliminate the communication costs of query results by merging the multiple successive BFs. Furthermore, when BF cannot work, a lightweight proof by SMT (Sorted Merkle Tree) is exploited to further reduce the network overhead. The security analysis confirms LVQ's ability to enable both correctness and completeness validation. In addition, the experimental results demonstrate its lightweight.","[Dai, Xiaohai; Xiao, Jiang; Yang, Wenhui; Wang, Chaofan; Chang, Jian; Han, Rui; Jin, Hai] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Cluster & Grid Comp Lab, Serv Comp Technol & Syst Lab,Natl Engn Res Ctr Bi, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China","Huazhong University of Science & Technology","Xiao, J (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Cluster & Grid Comp Lab, Serv Comp Technol & Syst Lab,Natl Engn Res Ctr Bi, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.","jiangxiao@hust.edu.cn","","","Technology Innovation Project of Hubei Province of China [2019AEA171]","Technology Innovation Project of Hubei Province of China","This work is supported by the Technology Innovation Project of Hubei Province of China under grant No. 2019AEA171, Jiang Xiao is the corresponding author of the paper.","","23","1","1","0","2","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","1063-6927","","978-1-7281-7002-2","INT CON DISTR COMP S","","","2020","","","","","","","1020","1030","","10.1109/ICDCS47774.2020.00096","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS47774.2020.00096","","","11","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR7JC","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000667971400093","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Design/methodology/approach Our methodology consists to model each pair equity/asset indices by bivariate symmetric and asymmetric dynamic conditional models (A) DCC to evaluate the portfolio design associated implications on both daily and weekly collected data base, with regard to the period ranging from July, 2010 to January 2018. To assess the extent to which the Bitcoin, VIX futures and sovereign CDS may stand as diversifiers, i.e. as hedging or safe haven instruments against the various stock indexes, we adopt the same method applied by Baur and Lucey (2010). Findings Empirical results show that the hedging and safe haven roles associated with the three hedging instruments tend to differ noticeably across time horizons and model used.

We empirically tested our conceptualized research model using the primary data collected from 443 respondents through a survey conducted in China. Results have shown that the usage of social media is positively associated with users' intentions toward adopting Bitcoin through their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Individuals' intentions are subsequently associated with their actual behavior toward the adoption of Bitcoin, while we found perceived risk associated with Bitcoin as a moderator on the relationship between the intentions of individuals and their actual behavior.

Professional investigators at Chainalysis have traced these stolen funds from the initial breach on an exchange to off-ramps, i.e. services where criminals are able to convert the stolen funds into fiat or other cryptocurrencies. We analyzed six hack subnetworks of bitcoin transactions known to belong to two prominent hacking groups. We analyze each hack according to eight network features, both static and temporal, and successfully classify each hack to its respective hacking group through our newly proposed method. We find that the static features, such as node balance, in degree, and out degree are not as useful in classifying the hacks into hacking groups as temporal features related to how quickly the criminals cash out. We validate our operating hypothesis that the key distinction between the two hacking groups is the acceleration with which the funds exit through terminal nodes in the subnetworks.","[Goldsmith, Daniel; Grauer, Kim; Shmalo, Yonah] Chainalysis, New York, NY 10003 USA","","Goldsmith, D (corresponding author), Chainalysis, New York, NY 10003 USA.","daniel.goldsmith@chainalysis.com","","","Chainalysis","Chainalysis","Funding This research was funded by Chainalysis.","","16","3","3","3","6","SPRINGERNATURE","LONDON","CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND","","2364-8228","","APPL NETW SCI","Appl.

Further, the United States (US) EPU increases the volatility and trading volume of BTC after EPU spike days, whereas the United Kingdom (UK) EPU does not show such trends. Moreover, we observe a spillover effect for the US EPU to the UK BTC market. We further construct the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC)-GARCH model to test the dynamic correlation between EPU and BTC. Our results show that the effect of the US EPU on BTC/USD is greater than the effect of the UK EPU on BTC/GBP.

Further, the negative impact is strongly significant when the miner's revenues are low and volatile. Thus, the higher energy consumption in the wake of escalating global energy costs amid bearish market sentiments impedes the miners to break-even.

In the present research, along with providing the required power for Bitcoin (BTC) mining, a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system fed either by natural gas or biogas as a renewable source of energy is used to supply the electricity demand. Thermodynamic modeling for the fuel cell system is applied to determine the required biogas or natural gas. For the proposed cases (grid-based, natural gas-fed SOFC and biogas fed SOFC), various scenarios depending on the Bitcoin price and mining difficulty are proposed. Also, the economic viability for each scenario in several countries is investigated and compared. Results indicate more profitability for grid-based mining in Bitcoin prices up to $20,000, but as the Bitcoin price increases SOFC based mining operations achieve reasonable profitability. It is shown that Iran, Russia, and China with cumulative cash flows of $87,300, $77,200 and $70,500 respectively, are the best countries to mine BTC using grid electricity while Iran, Canada and Russia are the best countries using a natural gas-fed SOFC system. While the profitability of SOFC-based mining is lower than grid-based mining, the latter method compensates with better sustainability and lower environmental costs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors look also at the governmental change of approach towards the use and mining of cryptocurrencies being one of the assets and potential applications of bitcoin as (quasi) money. Design/methodology/approach The authors collected the daily data (a period from 01 May 2014 to 31 July 2018) on the development of the following magnitudes: Caracas Stock Exchange main index: indice Bursatil de Capitalisacion (IBC) index; gold price in US dollars, the oil price in US dollars and Bitcoin price in bolivar fuerte (VEF) (LocalBitcoins). The authors estimated a threshold VAR model between IBC and each of the possible safe-haven assets, where the trigger variable was the IBC; then the authors modelled the residuals from the TVAR model using MGARCH model with dynamic conditional correlation. Findings The results show that that gold is a better safe-haven than oil for Venezuelan investors, while bitcoin can be considered a weak safe haven. Still, bitcoin can perform (to a certain extent) money functions in a crisis-driven country. Research limitations/implications Further research after the change of local currency from VEF into bolivar soberano might be looked at on the later stage. Practical implications The authors provide evidence on which of analysed asset is the best safe-haven for the investors acting in the time of the crisis. The evidence goes in line with other authors' findings, thus, the results might bring implications for investors of more universal character. Additionally, the result might be helpful for governments and/or monetary authorities while projecting institutional frameworks and conducting monetary policy. Social implications The unprecedented economic crisis in Venezuela was one of the factors that fuelled the mining and use of cryptocurrencies in the daily life of its citizens. Nowadays, the country is a leader in terms of the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Latin America.

Being tremendously successful, the Bitcoin system is designed to support reliable, secure, and trusted transactions between untrusted peers. Since its release in 2009, the Bitcoin system has rapidly grown to an unprecedentedly large scale. However, the real-world behaviors of miners and users in the system and the efficacy of the original Bitcoin system design in the field deployment still remain unclear, hindering us from understanding its internals and developing the next-generation cryptocurrency system. In this paper, we study the behaviors of Bitcoin miners and users and their interactions based on quantitative analysis of more than nine years of Bitcoin transaction history, from its first release on January 3rd, 2009 to April 30th, 2018. We have analyzed over 300 million transaction records to study the transactions' processing, confirmation, and implementation. We have obtained several critical findings regarding how the miners and users exploit the high degree of freedom provided by the Bitcoin system to achieve their own interests. For example, we find that miners often attempt to maximize their profits even by sacrificing system performance; users could try to speed up the transaction processing by mistakenly trading off security for reduced latency. Such unexpected behaviors, to some degree, deviate from the original design purposes of the Bitcoin system and could bring undesirable consequences. Besides revealing several unexpected behaviors of the Bitcoin miners and users in the real world, we have also discussed the associated system implications as well as optimization opportunities in the future.","[Hou, Binbing] LinkedIn Co, Sunnyvale, CA 94085 USA; [Chen, Feng] Louisiana State Univ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University","Hou, BB (corresponding author), LinkedIn Co, Sunnyvale, CA 94085 USA.","bhou@linkedin.com; fchen@csc.lsu.edu","","","U.S. National Science Foundation [CCF-1453705, CCF-1629291, CCF-1910958]","U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback and insightful comments.

Along with the continuous evolvement of mining pools are the increasingly intense competitions among them. Recent empirical studies have shown that the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is one of the most common ways for competing mining pools to sabotage the rivals and earn illegitimate rewards. Existing efforts have been made on using static game models to analyze the interactions between mining pools, and derive the Nash Equilibrium and optimal attacking strategies in a one-time static context. To better understand the impact of such DDoS attacks, in this paper, we take a starkly different approach, and for the first time address the dynamics in mining pool attacks. Specifically, we start by formulating the interactive competition among mining pools as a general-sum stochastic game. Then we propose an efficient Nash learning algorithm to obtain the near optimal attacking strategy that maximizes the expected long-term utility. Our theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results both show that the proposed strategy outperforms the baseline myopic learning algorithm, which only aims at maximizing the revenue in the current time stage. These findings, together with our proposed stochastic game model and learning algorithm, are expected to provide more practical guidelines for mining pools to survive and thrive in the highly-competitive bitcoin ecosystem.","[Wu, Shuangke; Chen, Yanjiao] Wuhan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Li, Minghui] Wuhan Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Luo, Xiangyang] State Key Lab Math Engn & Adv Comp, Zhengzhou 450000, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhe] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China; [Liu, Lan] Cent China Normal Univ, Natl Engn Lab Educ Big Data, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China","Wuhan University; Wuhan University; PLA Information Engineering University; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics; Central China Normal University","Chen, YJ (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.","wsk9551@whu.edu.cn; chenyanjiao@whu.edu.cn; minghuili@whu.edu.cn; xiangyangluo@126.com; z446liu@uwaterloo.ca; lanliu@mail.ccnu.edu.cn","","Chen, Yanjiao/0000-0002-1382-0679","NSFC [61972296, 61702380, U1636219]; Wuhan Advanced Application Project [2019010701011419]; Equipment Pre-Research Joint Fund of Ministry of Education of China (Youth Talent) [6141A02033327]","NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Wuhan Advanced Application Project; Equipment Pre-Research Joint Fund of Ministry of Education of China (Youth Talent)","The work of Yanjiao Chen was supported in part by the NSFC under Grant 61972296 and Grant 61702380, in part by the Wuhan Advanced Application Project under Grant 2019010701011419, and in part by the Equipment Pre-Research Joint Fund of Ministry of Education of China (Youth Talent) under Grant 6141A02033327.

This paper proposes a coin mixing scheme (mixing countersignature scheme, ring signature, and coin mixing approach) that allows users to transact business untraceably and unlinkably without having to trust a third party to ensure coins are safe. Our proposed novel countersignature scheme simulation results prove the countersignature scheme's correctness with an average running time of 4 mu s using PBC type A.80. The scheme's security and privacy are met with standard ring signature, ECDSA unforgeability and our countersignature. We demonstrated the efficiency of the mixing scheme using bitcoin's core regtest mode to set up a private bitcoin network. The mix takes 80, 160, 320, 640, 800 secs to service 500, 1,000, 2,000, 4,000, 5,000 users respectively.

Cryptocurrencies price behaviour is still largely unexplored, presenting new opportunities for researchers and economists to highlight similarities and differences with standard financial prices. We compared our results with various benchmarks: one recent work on Bitcoin prices forecasting that follows different approaches, a well-known paper that uses Intel, National Bank shares and Microsoft daily NASDAQ closing prices spanning a 3-year interval and another, more recent paper which gives quantitative results on stock market index predictions. We followed different approaches in parallel, implementing both statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms: the Simple Linear Regression (SLR) model for uni-variate series forecast using only closing prices, and the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model for multivariate series using both price and volume data. We used two artificial neural networks as well: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Long short-term memory (LSTM). While the entire time series resulted to be indistinguishable from a random walk, the partitioning of datasets into shorter sequences, representing different price regimes, allows to obtain precise forecast as evaluated in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE) and relative Root Mean Square Error (relativeRMSE). In this case the best results are obtained using more than one previous price, thus confirming the existence of time regimes different from random walks. Our models perform well also in terms of time complexity, and provide overall results better than those obtained in the benchmark studies, improving the state-of-the-art.","[Uras, Nicola; Marchesi, Lodovica; Marchesi, Michele; Tonelli, Roberto] Univ Cagliari, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Cagliari, Italy","University of Cagliari","Uras, N; Marchesi, L (corresponding author), Univ Cagliari, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Cagliari, Italy.","nicola.uras@unica.it; lodovica.marchesi@unica.it","","","research project EasyWallet'' - POR FESR 2014-2020 Asse 1, Azione 1.1.3 Strategia 2 Creare opportunita di lavoro favorendo la competitivita delle imprese'' Programma di intervento 3 Competitivita delle imprese'' Bando Aiuti per progetti di ricerca e sv; research project Crypto-Trading''-POR FESR 2014-2020 -Asse 1, Azione 1.1.3 Strategia 2 Creare opportunita di lavoro favorendo la competitivita delle imprese''; Programma di intervento 3 Competitivita delle imprese'' Bando Aiuti per progetti di ricerca e sviluppo''","research project EasyWallet'' - POR FESR 2014-2020 Asse 1, Azione 1.1.3 Strategia 2 Creare opportunita di lavoro favorendo la competitivita delle imprese'' Programma di intervento 3 Competitivita delle imprese'' Bando Aiuti per progetti di ricerca e sv; research project Crypto-Trading''-POR FESR 2014-2020 -Asse 1, Azione 1.1.3 Strategia 2 Creare opportunita di lavoro favorendo la competitivita delle imprese''; Programma di intervento 3 Competitivita delle imprese'' Bando Aiuti per progetti di ricerca e sviluppo''","This research is supported by the research project EasyWallet'' - POR FESR 2014-2020 Asse 1, Azione 1.1.3 Strategia 2 Creare opportunita di lavoro favorendo la competitivita delle imprese'' Programma di intervento 3 Competitivita delle imprese'' Bando Aiuti per progetti di ricerca e sviluppo'' Principal Investigator: Michele Marchesi, and by the research project Crypto-Trading''-POR FESR 2014-2020 -Asse 1, Azione 1.1.3 Strategia 2 Creare opportunita di lavoro favorendo la competitivita delle imprese''.

While speculators seek to profit from extrapolating the price trends, tech-savvy investors trade based on the prospective value of Bitcoin, which is a function of factors that capture the market demand and technical supply of Bitcoin. Estimating the structural model, we find the coexistence of speculators and tech-savvy investors in the Bitcoin market. We further show that, regardless of the market states, tech-savvy investors consistently buy (sell) Bitcoin when its price goes below (above) the prospective value. However, speculators follow a momentum trading strategy in the high-market-volatility regime and switch to a contrarian strategy in the low-market-volatility regime. Our finding suggests that a significant fraction of tech-savvy investors value the potential of Bitcoin as an innovative technology.

When someone transfers a large number of Bitcoins, the market receives this information and traders can adjust their expectations based on the new information. This paper investigates trading volume and its relation to asymmetric information around transfers on the Bitcoin blockchain. We collect data on 2132 large transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain between September 2018 and November 2019, where 500 or more Bitcoins were transferred. Using event study methodology, we identify significant positive abnormal trading volume for the 15-minute window before a large Bitcoin transaction as well as during and after the event. Using public information about Bitcoin addresses of cryptocurrency exchanges as proxies for information asymmetry, we find that transactions with high levels of information asymmetry negatively affect abnormal trading volume once the event becomes public knowledge, while some effects are even opposite for transactions with lower information asymmetry. The results show that blockchain transaction activity is a relevant aspect of Bitcoin's microstructure, as informed traders make use of the information in general and adjust their expectations based on the degree of information asymmetry.","[Ante, Lennart] Blockchain Res Lab, Colonnaden 72, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany; [Ante, Lennart] Univ Hamburg, Fac Business Econ & Social Sci, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany","University of Hamburg","Ante, L (corresponding author), Blockchain Res Lab, Colonnaden 72, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany.;Ante, L (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Fac Business Econ & Social Sci, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.","ante@blockchainresearchlab.org","Ante, Lennart/AAT-9436-2020","Ante, Lennart/0000-0002-5088-7127","","","","","41","9","9","1","12","AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS","SPRINGFIELD","PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA","2573-0134","","","QUANT FINANC ECON","Quant.

Apostolaki et al. [3]). Due to the nature of BGP operation, such a hijacking is globally observable and thus enables immediate detection of the attack and the identification of the perpetrator. In this paper, we present a stealthier attack, which we call the EREBUS attack, that partitions the Bitcoin network without any routing manipulations, which makes the attack undetectable to control-plane and even to data-plane detectors. The novel aspect of EREBUS is that it makes the adversary AS a natural man-in-the-middle network of all the peer connections of one or more targeted Bitcoin nodes by patiently influencing the targeted nodes' peering decision. We show that affecting the peering decision of a Bitcoin node, which is believed to be infeasible after a series of bug patches against the earlier Eclipse attack [29], is possible for the network adversary that can use abundant network address resources (e.g., spoofing millions of IP addresses in many other ASes) reliably for an extended period of time at a negligible cost. The EREBUS attack is readily available for large ASes, such as Tier-1 and large Tier-2 ASes, against the vast majority of 10K public Bitcoin nodes with only about 520 bit/s of attack traffic rate per targeted Bitcoin node and a modest (e.g., 5-6 weeks) attack execution period. The EREBUS attack can be mounted by nation-state adversaries who would be willing to execute sophisticated attack strategies patiently to compromise cryptocurrencies (e.g., control the consensus, take down a cryptocurrency, censor transactions). As the attack exploits the topological advantage of being a network adversary but not the specific vulnerabilities of Bitcoin core, no quick patches seem to be available. We discuss that some naive solutions (e.g., whitelisting, rate-limiting) are ineffective and third-party proxy solutions may worsen the Bitcoin's centralization problem. We provide some suggested modifications to the Bitcoin core and show that they effectively make the EREBUS attack significantly harder; yet, their nontrivial changes to the Bitcoin's network operation (e.g., peering dynamics, propagation delays) should be examined thoroughly before their wide deployment.","[Tran, Muoi; Choi, Inho; Moon, Gi Jun; Vu, Anh V.; Kang, Min Suk] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Moon, Gi Jun] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Vu, Anh V.] Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Nomi, Japan","National University of Singapore; Korea University; Japan Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (JAIST)","Tran, M (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.","muoitran@comp.nus.edu.sg; inhochoi@comp.nus.edu.sg; shangmoon@korea.ac.kr; anhvv@jaist.ac.jp; kangms@comp.nus.edu.sg","","Tran, Muoi/0000-0002-6049-5688","CRYSTAL Centre at National University of Singapore","CRYSTAL Centre at National University of Singapore","We thank the anonymous reviewers of this paper and our shepherd Neha Narula for their helpful feedback.

The conventional wisdom asserts that the mining protocol is incentive-compatible. However, Eyal and Sirer in 2014 have discovered a mining attack strategy called selfish mining (SM), in which a miner (or a mining pool) publishes the blocks it mines selectively instead of immediately. SM strategy would have the impact of wasting resources of honest miners. Scholars proposed various extensions of the SM strategy and approaches to defense the SM attack. Whether selfish mining occurs in practice or not, has been subject of extensive debate. For the first time, in this paper we propose a method to identify selfish miners by detecting anomalies in the properties of consecutive blocks' statistics. Furthermore, we extend our method to detect the mining cartels, in which miners secretly get together and share timely information. Our results provide evidence that these strategic behaviors take place in practice.","[Li, Sheng-Nan; Yang, Zhao] Univ Zurich, URPP Social Networks, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Tessone, Claudio J.] Univ Zurich, URPP Social Networks, UZH Blockchain Ctr, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland","University of Zurich; University of Zurich","Li, SN (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, URPP Social Networks, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.","shengnan.li@uzh.ch; zhao.yang@business.uzh.ch; claudio.tessone@business.uzh.ch","","Li, Sheng-Nan/0000-0002-2305-3186; Tessone, Claudio J./0000-0001-7733-6221","","","","","12","3","3","0","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-6680-3","","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7IE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000848725400042","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Therefore, reducing the power consumption and increasing the processing rate for the double SHA-256 algorithm is currently an important research trend. In this paper, we propose a high-data-rate low-power hardware architecture named the compact message expander (CME) double SHA-256. The CME double SHA-256 architecture combines resource sharing and fully unrolled datapath technologies to achieve both a high data rate and low power consumption. Notably, the CME algorithm utilizes the double SHA-256 input data characteristics to further reduce the hardware cost and power consumption. A review of the literature shows that the CME algorithm eliminates at least 9.68% of the 32-bit XOR gates, 16.49% of the 32-bit adders, and 16.79% of the registers required to calculate double SHA-256. We synthesized and laid out the CME double SHA-256 using CMOS 0.18 mu m technology. The hardware cost of the synthesized circuit is approximately 13.88% less than that of the conventional approach. The chip layout size is 5.9 mmx5.9 mm , and the correctness of the circuit was verified on a real hardware platform (ZCU 102). The throughput of the proposed architecture is 61.44 Gbps on an ASIC with Rohm 180nm CMOS standard cell library and 340 Gbps on a FinFET FPGA 16nm Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU102.","[Pham, Hoai Luan; Tran, Thi Hong; Phan, Tri Dung; Nakashima, Yasuhiko] Nara Inst Sci & Technol NAIST, Graduat Sch Informat Sci, Ikoma 6300192, Japan; [Duong Le, Vu Trung; Lam, Duc Khai] Vietnam Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Univ Informat & Technol, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam","Nara Institute of Science & Technology; Vietnam National University Hochiminh City","Tran, TH (corresponding author), Nara Inst Sci & Technol NAIST, Graduat Sch Informat Sci, Ikoma 6300192, Japan.","hong@is.naist.jp","Tran, Thi Hong/AAB-7110-2021","Luan, Pham Hoai/0000-0002-4272-0132; Tran, Thi Hong/0000-0002-2744-0079; Lam, Duc Khai/0000-0003-2711-1408","Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) under the Strategic Basic Research Programs PRESTO [2019A039]","Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) under the Strategic Basic Research Programs PRESTO(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST))","This work was supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) under the Strategic Basic Research Programs PRESTO Grant number 2019A039.","","32","9","10","2","7","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","139634","139646","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3012581","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3012581","","","13","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","MX5OU","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000557773100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We include five stock market indexes for different countries such as Standard and Poor's 500 composite Index (S&P), Nasdaq, Nikkei, Stoxx, and DowJones. Using daily data over the period 2010-2019. We examine two asymmetric stochastic volatility models used to describe the volatility dependencies found in most financial returns. Two models are compared, the first is the autoregressive stochastic volatility model with Student's t-distribution (ARSV-t), and the second is the basic SVOL. To estimate these models, our analysis is based on the Markov Chain Monte-Carlo method. Therefore, the technique used is a Metropolis-Hastings (Hastings in Biometrika 57:97-109, 1970), and the Gibbs sampler (Casella and George in Am Stat 46:167-174, 1992; Gelfand and Smith in J Am Stat Assoc 85:398-409, 1990; Gilks and Wild in 41:337-348, 1992). Model comparisons illustrate that the ARSV-t model performs better performances. We conclude that this model is better than the SVOL model on the MSE and AIC function. This result concerns bitcoin as well as the other stock market indices. Without forgetting that our finding proves the efficiency of Markov Chain for our sample and the convergence and stability for all parameters to a certain level. On the whole, it seems that permanent shocks have an effect on the volatility of the price of the bitcoin and also on the other stock market. Our results will help investors better diversify their portfolio by adding this cryptocurrency.","[Hachicha, A.] Univ Sfax, Fac Econ & Management, Lab Econ Dev, Airport Rd,Km 4,BP 3018, Sfax, Tunisia; [Hachicha, F.] Univ Sfax, Fac Sci Sfax, Dept Math, Sokra Rd Km 4,BP 3038, Sfax, Tunisia","Universite de Monastir; Universite de Sfax; Universite de Sfax; Faculty of Sciences Sfax","Hachicha, A (corresponding author), Univ Sfax, Fac Econ & Management, Lab Econ Dev, Airport Rd,Km 4,BP 3018, Sfax, Tunisia.","hachicha.ahmed@fsegs.rnu.tn; hachicha_fatmaa@yahoo.com","Hachicha, Fatma/AAB-7843-2021","Hachicha, Fatma/0000-0002-0999-0448","","","","","54","1","1","1","9","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0924-865X","1573-7179","","REV QUANT FINANC ACC","Rev.

The study uses the ARMA-GARCH model to capture Bitcoin's return and conditional volatility, and explores the impact of information flow rate on conditional volatility in the Bitcoin market based on the Mixture Distribution Hypothesis (Clark, 1973). There were 3,064 samples collected during the period from Pt of January 2012 to 20th April, 2020. Empirical results show that in the Bitcoin market, a daily high-low price spread has a significant inverse relationship for daily return, and information flow rate has a significant positive relationship for condition volatility. The study supports a significant negative relationship between information asymmetry and daily return, and there is a significant positive relationship between daily trading volume and condition volatility. When Bitcoin trades on Saturday & Sunday, there is a significant reverse relationship for conditional volatility and there exists a thy-of-the-week volatility effect. Under the impact of COVID-19 event, Bitcoin's condition volatility has increased significantly, indicating the risk of price changes.

Previous studies have provided evidence to suggest that macroeconomic news affects stock returns, commodity prices and interest rates. We construct a sentiment index based on news stories that follow the announcements of four macroeconomic indicators: GDP, unemployment, Consumer Price Index (CPI) and durable goods. By controlling for a number of potential biases we determine as to whether each of the series' have a significant impact on Bitcoin returns. While an increase in positive news surrounding unemployment rates and durable goods would typically result in a corresponding increase in equity returns, we observe the opposite to be true in the case of Bitcoin. Increases in positive news after unemployment and durable goods announcements result in a decrease in Bitcoin returns. Conversely, an increase in the percentage of negative news surrounding these announcements is linked with an increase in Bitcoin returns. News relating to GDP and CPI are found not to have any statistically significant relationships with Bitcoin returns. Our results indicate that this developing cryptocurrency market is further maturing through interactions with macroeconomic news.","[Corbet, Shaen; Meegan, Andrew] Dublin City Univ, DCU Business Sch, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Corbet, Shaen] Univ Waikato, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Larkin, Charles] Univ Bath, Inst Policy Res, Bath, Avon, England; [Larkin, Charles; Lucey, Brian M.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Business Sch, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Lucey, Brian M.] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Inst Business Res, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Lucey, Brian M.] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Yarovaya, Larisa] Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton, Hants, England","Dublin City University; University of Waikato; University of Bath; Trinity College Dublin; Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; University of Sydney; Solent University; University of Southampton","Corbet, S (corresponding author), Dublin City Univ, DCU Business Sch, Dublin 9, Ireland.;Corbet, S (corresponding author), Univ Waikato, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand.","shaen.corbet@dcu.ie","lucey, brian/AAY-3885-2021; Yarovaya, Larisa/AAB-3038-2021; Corbet, Shaen/B-4869-2017; Larkin, Charles/C-5815-2017","lucey, brian/0000-0002-4052-8235; Corbet, Shaen/0000-0001-7430-7417; Yarovaya, Larisa/0000-0002-9638-2917; Larkin, Charles/0000-0002-0352-2504","","","","","54","39","39","3","47","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1351-847X","1466-4364","","EUR J FINANC","Eur.

In massive, dynamic, and distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) networks like Bitcoin, where thousands of updates occur per second, it is hard to obtain an accurate topology representing the structure of the network as a graph with nodes and links by using the traditional local measurement approaches based on batches, offline data, or on the discovery of the topology around a small set of nodes and then combine them to discover an approximate network topology. All of which present some limitation when applying them on blockchain-based networks. In this paper, we propose a topology discovery system that performs a real-time data collection and analysis for Bitcoin P2P links, which assembles incoming nodes information for deeper graph analysis processing. The topology discovery system allows us to gain knowledge on the Bitcoin network size, the network stability in terms of reachable, churn, and well-connected nodes, as well as some data regarding the effects of some countries' Internet infrastructure on Bitcoin traffic.","[Essaid, Meryam; Park, Sejin; Ju, Hong-Taek] Keimyung Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Daegu, South Korea; [Ju, Hong-Taek] Keimyung Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Coll Engn, Daegu, South Korea","Keimyung University; Keimyung University","Ju, HT (corresponding author), Keimyung Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Daegu, South Korea.","juht@kmu.ac.kr","essaid, meryam/AAH-4812-2021","essaid, meryam/0000-0002-7991-9874","Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP) [2018-0-00539]; Korea government (MSIP); National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF2015R1D1A1A01059786]","Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP); Korea government (MSIP); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP), Grant/Award Number: 2018-0-00539 and Korea government (MSIP); National Research Foundation of Korea, Grant/Award Number: NRF2015R1D1A1A01059786","","20","6","6","1","12","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1055-7148","1099-1190","","INT J NETW MANAG","Int.

We adopt the method of measuring connectedness proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012, and 2014) in a VAR system to study the dynamic interdependence between returns in Bitcoin, stocks, oil, and gold. We find that the connectedness between bitcoin and conventional assets is weak. The separation of positive and negative returns in the Bitcoin market shows the existence of an asymmetric pattern of the spillover effects between Bitcoin and conventional assets. A rolling window analysis finds that although Bitcoin prices experience a rising link to other financial assets, the magnitude is proven to be moderate. However, connectedness via negative returns is much stronger than via positive ones and exhibits a clearly increasing trend in recent periods. Our results in application are generally robust to other popular cryptocurrencies, such as ETH and Ripple.

Owing to this rapid growth, cryptocurrency-related information is being increasingly shared online. As considerable portions of such information in online communities are noise, extracting meaningful information is important. Therefore, judging whose opinion should be considered more important or who the opinion leaders in online communities are is critical. This study analyzed the topics that contain meaningful information, in particular, user groups, by investigating the correlation between topic weights and their price change. The proposed analysis method involves (1) effective classification of the user groups using a hypertext-induced topic selection algorithm, (2) textual information analysis through topic modeling, and (3) the identification of user groups that have a high interest in the Bitcoin price by measuring the correlation between the price and the topics and by measuring the topic similarities between each user group and all users to determine the user group that can effectively represent the entire community. By analyzing the information shared by users, we observed that most users are interested in the price information, whereas users having social influence are not only interested in the price but also in other information.","[Kang, Kyeongpil; Choo, Jaegul] Korea Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, YoungBin] Chung Ang Univ, Grad Sch Adv Imaging Sci Multimedia & Film, Seoul, South Korea","Korea University; Chung Ang University","Kim, Y (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Bldg 305,Fac Off Bldg,84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea.","rudvlf0413@korea.ac.kr; jchoo@korea.ac.kr; ybkim85@cau.ac.kr","Choo, Jaegul/ABF-8315-2020","Choo, Jaegul/0000-0003-1071-4835","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning [NRF-2016R1C1B2015924]; Chung-Ang University","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); Chung-Ang University","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (NRF-2016R1C1B2015924) and the Chung-Ang University Research Grants in 2018.","","71","2","2","3","40","SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","THOUSAND OAKS","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","0894-4393","1552-8286","","SOC SCI COMPUT REV","Soc.

Much less work has been carried out into examining whether a technology adoption has impact on corporate reputation. This paper aims to examine the latter topic in a context where social media is the channel used to share news about the introduction of a new technology. The empirical setting of the study consists of five retail companies located in the USA that decided to include Bitcoin as a payment platform. Design/methodology/approach Twitter data were used to measure how sharing news about the adoption of new technology could affect the reputation of the companies selected, keeping a clear distinction between the volume of data relating to social media responses and the sentiment expressed in the tweets. A panel vector autoregression model was used to incorporate series of data relating to news items, volume and sentiment. Findings The results show that the news about the adoption of a new technology has a positive impact on both the volume of tech-related tweets and the sentiment expressed in the tweets themselves, although the patterns of these two effects are different. The resulting impact decreases after a few days, both in volume and in sentiment. Research limitations/implications The analysis has limitations that future research could address by extending and diversifying the examined companies and the social media used as data sources. The research suggests that managers in medium-sized companies can leverage on the introduction of new technologies that have a direct impact on their customers and gain reputational benefits in terms of immediate visibility. Originality/value The research introduces an additional dimension of analysis to the current stream of corporate reputation. Although the literature has already covered the dynamics of response to events on Twitter, by focusing on the adoption of the new Bitcoin technology, the paper provides novel insights.","[Caviggioli, Federico] Politecn Torino, Dept Management & Prod Engn DIGEP, Turin, Italy; [Lamberti, Lucio] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Milan, Italy; [Landoni, Paolo] Politecn Torino, Dept Management & Prod Engn, Turin, Italy; [Meola, Paolo] Instilla Srl, Milan, Italy","Polytechnic University of Turin; Polytechnic University of Milan; Polytechnic University of Turin","Caviggioli, F (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Dept Management & Prod Engn DIGEP, Turin, Italy.","federico.caviggioli@polito.it; lucio.lamberti@polimi.it; paolo.landoni@polito.it; Paolo.meola@instilla.com","Caviggioli, Federico/A-3423-2014; Landoni, Paolo/D-1068-2018","Caviggioli, Federico/0000-0002-1704-9201; Landoni, Paolo/0000-0001-5079-1101","","","","","111","12","12","3","33","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1061-0421","2054-1643","","J PROD BRAND MANAG","J.

In this work we evaluate operation of BTC network under a mix of regular, and compact block traffic, assuming that nodes randomly leave, and re-join the network, and perform block and, optionally, transaction pool (mempool) synchronization upon returning. Our analysis begins by evaluating block, and transaction deficits accumulated during the node absence and block synchronization. Then, we analyze mempool behavior, and show that mempool synchronization is necessary since it decreases probability of transaction deficit, and the need for transaction retrieval actions. Finally, we analyze the impact of synchronization activities, and transaction deficit on data distribution times in the BTC network with high, and low bandwidth distribution modes for a mix of compact, and regular blocks. Results demonstrate resilience to node absence, and subsequent synchronization, as well as substantial performance improvements for small protocol changes. Furthermore we show that the low bandwidth mode is more resilient to potential security attacks.","[Misic, Jelena; Misic, Vojislav B.] Ryerson Univ, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada; [Chang, Xiaolin] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing Key Lab Secur Privacy Intelligent Transpo, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China","Toronto Metropolitan University; Beijing Jiaotong University","Misic, J (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada.","jmisic@ryerson.ca; vmisic@ryerson.ca; xlchang@bjtu.edu.cn","","","","","","","22","5","5","0","2","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA","2327-4697","","","IEEE T NETW SCI ENG","IEEE Trans.

This novel axiomatic -formalization allows us to characterize what other protocols are feasible: every protocol with these properties must have the same reward scheme as Bitcoin. This implies an impossibility result for risk-averse miners.

Then the feature vectors are input into LSTM for training and forecasting the short-term price of Bitcoin. The result shows that the CNN-LSTM hybrid neural network can effectively improve the accuracy of value prediction and direction prediction compared with the single structure neural network. The finding has important implications for researchers and investors in the digital currencies market.","[Li, Yan; Dai, Wei] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Financial Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China","Central University of Finance & Economics","Li, Y (corresponding author), Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Financial Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.","15600129388@163.com","","","","","","","10","10","10","2","18","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","","2051-3305","","J ENG-JOE","J.

Due to the lack of strictly defined fundamental indicators, supported by the results of research by the academic community, considering cryptocurrencies as investment opportunities can put investors in a subordinate position, a situation of complete uncertainty. Cryptocurrencies and their entire technical infrastructure are still a kind of unknown to the general public. Due to this, but also the lack of a regulatory framework, investors have to rely on sometimes uncertain information gathered through various media platforms. However, regardless of the type of assets and the mentioned shortcomings, when constructing a portfolio, investors should consider the dynamics of returns of potential components of the portfolio in order to identify and quantify the assumed investment risk and define the expected return. Cryptocurrencies are based on the idea of decentralization initially introduced by bitcoin blockchain technology and as such have their own historical sequence of origin. Since bitcoin is the first digital currency based on asymmetric cryptography, the change in its value can serve as a leading indicator of the movement of the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Accordingly, this paper will formally identify and describe the performance of the cryptocurrency portfolio with different optimization goals taking into account the assumption of a significant systematic impact of bitcoin cryptocurrency on the dynamics of the value of the aggregate secondary cryptocurrency market. For this purpose, six optimization targets will be formed: MinVar, MinCVaR, MaxSR, MaxSTARR, MaxUT and MaxMean. The results of the formed portfolios will be compared with the results of portfolios with the same allocation objectives, but which include a limitation on the impact of BTC as a systematic factor. The results suggest that by controlling the exposure by factor, better overall portfolio performance can be achieved through higher returns and Sharpe Ratio in four of the six implemented optimization strategies, while in terms of absolute risk measure five out of six portfolios achieved lower overall risk. Also, the obtained results confirm that the bitcoin transaction system plays a major role in defining the future movement of the value of the secondary cryptocurrency market.","[Tomic, Bojan] HEP Distribut Syst Operator, Gunduliceva 32, Zagreb 10000, Croatia","","Tomic, B (corresponding author), HEP Distribut Syst Operator, Gunduliceva 32, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.","bojan.tomic2@gmail.com","","","","","","","20","0","0","0","2","UNIV ZAGREB, FAC ECONOMICS & BUSINESS","Zagreb","J.

Bitcoin has experienced significant price swings in daily and long-term valuations. In this paper, we propose a partial differential equation (PDE) model on the bitcoin transaction network for forecasting the bitcoin price movement. Through analysis of bitcoin subgraphs or chainlets, the PDE model captures the influence of transaction patterns on the bitcoin price over time and combines the effect of all chainlet clusters. In addition, Google Trends index is incorporated to the PDE model to reflect the effect of the bitcoin market sentiment. The experiment results demonstrate that the PDE model is capable of forecasting the bitcoin price movement. The paper is the first attempt to apply a PDE model to the bitcoin transaction network for forecasting.","[Wang, Yufang] Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China; [Wang, Haiyan] Arizona State Univ, Sch Math & Nat Sci, Tempe, AZ 85069 USA","Tianjin University of Finance & Economics; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe","Wang, HY (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Math & Nat Sci, Tempe, AZ 85069 USA.","haiyan.wang@asu.edu","","Wang, Haiyan/0000-0002-5204-967X","Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China [18YJCZH184]; Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City (Tianjin Natural Science Foundation) [19JCQNJC14800]; National Social Science Fund Youth Project [19CGL002]","Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City (Tianjin Natural Science Foundation); National Social Science Fund Youth Project","Y.W. was partially supported by the Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China (18YJCZH184), the Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City (Tianjin Natural Science Foundation) (19JCQNJC14800), and the National Social Science Fund Youth Project (19CGL002).","","27","5","5","4","24","AIP Publishing","MELVILLE","1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA","1054-1500","1089-7682","","CHAOS","Chaos","JUL","2020","30","7","","","","","","","73127","10.1063/5.0002759","http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0002759","","","9","Mathematics, Applied; Physics, Mathematical","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Mathematics; Physics","MS1TH","32752622","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000554066400002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, the share of past owners also increased, suggesting an influx of Bitcoin owners who subsequently divested after the steep rise of prices in 2017. The main reason for owning Bitcoin remains speculation, though this share decreased slightly since 2017. On the other hand, the share of Canadians who reported using Bitcoin for transactions a few times a month or more increased.

So we cannot necessarily trust a Bitcoin user with wallet address. Actually, there is no method for assigning trust to user addresses in Bitcoin. Although we can provide trust to user address by inserting certificate into Bitcoin transaction using OP_RETURN, it still has some problems about wastefulness. In this paper, we propose a new method that efficiently assigns trust to user address using Bitcoin transfer only, which does not need to use OP_RETURN. Our proposed method can realize a trust providing mechanism for Blockchain 1.0 without adding any new function. Main idea of our method is that token coin (Bitcoin transfer itself) can be used as a trust providing mechanism. For feasibility study, we experimentally show the trust assigning in the Bitcoin testnet. Furthermore, our method can be easily adopted into other cryptocurrencies.","[Omote, Kazumasa; Suzuki, Asuka; Sato, Teppei] Univ Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Omote, Kazumasa] Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Tokyo, Japan","University of Tsukuba; National Institute of Information & Communications Technology (NICT) - Japan","Omote, K (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.;Omote, K (corresponding author), Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Tokyo, Japan.","omote@risk.tsukuba.ac.jp","",""," [19H04107]","","This work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (19H04107).","","15","0","0","1","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-8370-1","","","","2020","","","","","","","38","43","","10.1109/BCCA50787.2020.9274463","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BCCA50787.2020.9274463","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7IH","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000848747500006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We study this question by investigating the role of network cohesion in the relationship between social media sentiment and price changes in the Bitcoin market. As network cohesion is associated with information correlation within the discussion network, we hypothesize that less cohesive social media discussion networks are better at predicting the next-day returns than more cohesive networks. Both regression analyses and trading simulations based on data collected from Bitcointalk.org confirm our hypothesis.

The data analysis is initiated with a broad scope of 114 cryptocurrencies, then a more detailed understanding of five of the most popular cryptocurrencies and followed up with forecasts focused specifically on Bitcoin (while other forecasts are available as supplementary material). The model parameters are estimated with Bayesian approach using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. In order to implement model selection, the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) is used. Proposed models are compared with many popular models including those commonly used in industry. The models are applied in a Value-at-Risk (VaR) context and several measures are used to assess model performance. (C) 2018 EcoSta Econometrics and Statistics. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain is by far the most well-known DLT, used to record transactions among peers, based on the BTC digital currency. In this paper we focus on the network side of the BTC P2P network, analyzing its nodes from a purely network measurements-based approach. We present a BTC crawler able to discover and track the BTC P2P network through active measurements, and use it to analyze its main properties. Through the combined analysis of multiple snapshots of the BTC network as well as by using other publicly available data sources on the BTC network and DLT, we unveil the BTC P2P network, locate its active nodes, study their performance, and track the evolution of the network over the past two years. Among other relevant findings, we show that (i) the size of the BTC network has remained almost constant during the last 12 months - since the major BTC price drop in early 2018, (ii) most of the BTC P2P network resides in US and EU countries, and (iii) despite this western network locality, most of the mining activity and corresponding revenue is controlled by major mining pools located in China. By additionally analyzing the distribution of BTC coins among independent BTC entities (i.e., single BTC addresses or groups of BTC addresses controlled by the same actor), we also conclude that (iv) BTC is very far from being the decentralized and uncontrolled system it is so much advertised to be, with only 4.5% of all the BTC entities holding about 85% of all circulating BTC coins.","[Ben Mariem, Sami; Casas, Pedro; Romiti, Matteo; Stutz, Rainer; Haslhofer, Bernhard] AIT Austrian Inst Technol, Seibersdorf, Austria; [Ben Mariem, Sami; Donnet, Benoit] Univ Liege, Liege, Belgium","Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT); University of Liege","Ben Mariem, S (corresponding author), AIT Austrian Inst Technol, Seibersdorf, Austria.;Ben Mariem, S (corresponding author), Univ Liege, Liege, Belgium.","","","","Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF) [ICT15-129]; European Union [740558]; Austrian FFG's KIRAS programme under project VIRTCRIME [860672]","Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF); European Union(European Commission); Austrian FFG's KIRAS programme under project VIRTCRIME","The research leading to these results has been partially funded by the Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF) through project ICT15-129, Big-DAMA.

Therefore, it is expected that there should be no significant differences among the individual exchanges concerning the same asset being traded. Prices should quickly reach comparable values on all stock exchanges, and they should return to equilibrium in a relative time frame. Hence, the investors, while making decisions on the selection of a cryptocurrency market, should be guided primarily by the exchange security considerations, its flexibility, availability of a product offer, and costs of order processing. The work aims to check whether virtual currency exchanges differ from each other in the context of directional movement, both in an upward and downward trend. To achieve the objective of the paper, we used Directional Movement Index, supported by the Directional Indicators, to compare the distribution of the strength of the directional movement across three different cryptocurrency exchanges (Bitstamp, Coinbase, Kraken) within the up and the downward price movement phase. The comparison is made based on the results of the non-paramefrical tests such as Wilcoxon test, Hodges Lehmann test, Ansari-Bradley test, and Conover test. The results show that theoretically, the choice of a cryptocurrency exchange in an upward frend will cause no significant difference for an investor and its strategy. However, the choice of a stock exchange in a downward frend may have a substantial impact on the rates of return.","[Szetela, Beata; Mentel, Grzegorz; Mentel, Urszula] Rzeszow Univ Technol, Al Powstancow Warszawy 12, PL-35959 Rzeszow, Poland; [Bilan, Yuriy] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, 5139 Mostni Str, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic","Rzeszow University of Technology; Tomas Bata University Zlin","Szetela, B (corresponding author), Rzeszow Univ Technol, Al Powstancow Warszawy 12, PL-35959 Rzeszow, Poland.","beata@prz.edu.pl; gmentel@prz.edu.pl; u.mentel@prz.edu.pl; yuriy_bilan@yahoo.co.uk","Mentel, Urszula/AAM-2725-2020; Bilan, Yuriy/ABC-6948-2021; Szetela, Beata/ABG-7631-2021; Bilan, Yuriy/B-3119-2012; Mentel, Grzegorz/T-1850-2018","Mentel, Urszula/0000-0003-2060-8980; Szetela, Beata/0000-0002-7421-2378; Bilan, Yuriy/0000-0003-0268-009X; Mentel, Grzegorz/0000-0002-6371-1219","","","","","64","5","5","0","10","KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL","KAUNAS","LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA","1392-2785","2029-5839","","INZ EKON","Inz.

The period of study is a little over 7 years. The results suggest that Bitcoin stands as a highly speculative class of asset with extremely high volatility and with respect to hedging, Bitcoin stands as a possible tool of hedge with the U.S. Aggregate Bond index and to a certain extent against Gold but fails to be an optimal hedge against the S&P 500 and Crude Oil in the U.S. economy between April 29, 2013 and October 31, 2019 due to its highly volatile nature.","[Subramanian, Abhishek; Rao, Balaga Mohana] CHRIST Deemed Univ, Dept Econ, Bannerghatta Rd Campus, Bengaluru 560076, India","Christ University","Rao, BM (corresponding author), CHRIST Deemed Univ, Dept Econ, Bannerghatta Rd Campus, Bengaluru 560076, India.","mohanraobalaga@gmail.com","","","","","","","26","0","0","0","8","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1472-3891","1479-1854","","J PUBLIC AFF","J.

The intra-cryptocurrency market analysis reveals that Bitcoin contains predictive information that can nonlinearly forecast the performance of other digital currencies when cryptocurrency prices either are rising or declining. The dominant power of Bitcoin is not dismissed using the intraday data. Further, Bitcoin's intraday lagged shocks and volatility induces more rapid and destabilizing effects on the conditional volatility of other currencies than each of the other currencies does on BTC's conditional volatility.

We develop an ensemble predictive system based on artificial neural networks to forecast Bitcoin daily trading volume level. Indeed, although ensemble forecasts are increasingly employed in various forecasting tasks, developing an intelligent predictive system for Bitcoin trading volume based on ensemble forecasts has not been addressed yet. Ensemble Bitcoin trading volume are forecasted using two specific artificial neural networks; namely, radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) and generalized regression neural networks (GRNN). They are adopted to respectively capture local and general patterns in Bitcoin trading volume data. Finally, the feedforward artificial neural network (FFNN) is implemented to generate Bitcoin final trading volume after having aggregated the forecasts from RBFNN and GRNN. In this regard, FFNN is executed to merge local and global forecasts in a nonlinear framework. Overall, our proposed ensemble predictive system reduced the forecasting errors by 18.81% and 62.86% when compared to its components RBFNN and GRNN, respectively. In addition, the ensemble system reduced the forecasting error by 90.49% when compared to a single FFNN used as a basic reference model. Thus, the empirical outcomes show that our proposed ensemble predictive model allows achieving an improvement in terms of forecasting. Regarding the practical results of this work, while being fast, applying the artificial neural networks to develop an ensemble predictive system to forecast Bitcoin daily trading volume is recommended to apply for addressing simultaneously local and global patterns used to characterize Bitcoin trading data. We conclude that the proposed artificial neural networks ensemble forecasting model is easy to implement and efficient for Bitcoin daily volume forecasting.","[Lahmiri, Salim; Saade, Raafat G.; Morin, Danielle; Nebebe, Fassil] Concordia Univ, John Molson Sch Business, Dept Supply Chain & Business Technol Management, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Concordia University - Canada","Lahmiri, S (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, John Molson Sch Business, Dept Supply Chain & Business Technol Management, Montreal, PQ, Canada.","salim.lahmiri@concordia.ca; raafat.saade@concordia.ca; danielle.morin@concordia.ca; fassil.nebebe@concordia.ca","","","","","","","20","2","2","1","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-6175-4","","","","2020","","","","","","","30","33","","10.1109/CloudTech49835.2020.9365913","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CloudTech49835.2020.9365913","","","4","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BR9DA","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000674949000006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Hence, proposing an effective approach of refining the existing block creation and verification strategy for improving transaction rate without compromising security.","[Bala, R.; Manoharan, R.] Pondicherry Engn Coll, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Pondicherry, India","Pondicherry Engineering College","Bala, R (corresponding author), Pondicherry Engn Coll, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Pondicherry, India.","balasekar.bs@gmail.com","","R, Bala/0000-0003-3988-4969","","","","","17","0","0","0","0","INST COMPUTER SCIENCES, SOCIAL INFORMATICS & TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENG-ICST","GHENT","BEGIJNHOFLAAN 93, GHENT, 90000, BELGIUM","2032-9407","","","EAI ENDORSED TRANS S","EAI Endorsed Trans.

Specifically, we investigate the role of legal, criminal, financial, and social determinants of the adoption of Bitcoin infrastructure. We offer some support for the view that the adoption of cryptocurrency infrastructure is driven by perceived failings of traditional financial systems, in that the spread of Bitcoin infrastructure is associated with low trust in banks and the financial system among inhabitants of a region, and with the occurrence of country-level inflation crises. On the other hand, our findings also suggest that active support for Bitcoin is higher in locations with well-developed banking services. Finally, we find support for the view that bitcoin adoption is also partly driven by cryptocurrencies' usefulness in engaging in illicit trade.","[Saiedi, Ed; Brostrom, Anders] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Management, Lindstedtsvagen 30, S-11428 Stockholm, Sweden; [Saiedi, Ed; Ruiz, Felipe] Univ Politecn Madrid, Sch Ind Engn ETSII, Dept Business Adm & Stat, Madrid 28006, Spain","Royal Institute of Technology; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; ETS de Ingenieros Industriales","Saiedi, E (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Management, Lindstedtsvagen 30, S-11428 Stockholm, Sweden.","ed.saiedi@indek.kth.se; anders.brostrom@indek.kth.se; felipe.ruiz@upm.es","Broström, Anders/P-4580-2019; Saiedi, Ed/AAQ-3388-2020","Broström, Anders/0000-0003-0820-2769; Saiedi, Ed/0000-0003-3679-1222","Royal Institute of Technology; European Commission, Erasmus Mundus Action 1","Royal Institute of Technology; European Commission, Erasmus Mundus Action 1(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre)","Open access funding provided by Royal Institute of Technology.

It is critical that a client is connected to at least one honest peer, as otherwise the client can be convinced to accept a maliciously forked view of the blockchain. In such an eclipse attack, the client is unable to reliably distinguish the canonical view of the blockchain from the view provided by the attacker. The consequences of this can be catastrophic if the client makes business decisions based on a distorted view of the blockchain transactions. In this paper, we investigate the design space and propose two approaches for Bitcoin clients to detect whether an eclipse attack against them is ongoing. Each approach chooses a different trade-off between average attack detection time and network load. The first scheme is based on the detection of suspicious block timestamps. The second scheme allows blockchain clients to utilize their natural connections to the Internet (i.e., standard web activity) to gossip about their blockchain views with other clients through contacted servers. Our proposals improve upon previously proposed eclipse attack countermeasures without introducing any dedicated infrastructure or changes to the Bitcoin protocol and network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the gossipbased schemes through real-world implementation. The results of our experiments indicate that the protocol incurs a negligible overhead, detects eclipse attacks rapidly with high probability, and is well-suited for practical deployment.(1).","[Alangot, Bithin] Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Ctr Cybersecur Syst & Networks, Amritapuri, India; [Alangot, Bithin; Reijsbergen, Daniel; Venugopalan, Sarad; Szalachowski, Pawel] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Singapore, Singapore","Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham; Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Amritapuri; Singapore University of Technology & Design","Alangot, B (corresponding author), Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Ctr Cybersecur Syst & Networks, Amritapuri, India.;Alangot, B (corresponding author), Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Singapore, Singapore.","","VENUGOPALAN, Sarad/CAF-5029-2022; VENUGOPALAN, Sarad/CAG-0865-2022","","A*STAR under its RIE2020 Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering (AME) Programmtic Programme [A19E3b0099]","A*STAR under its RIE2020 Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering (AME) Programmtic Programme(Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR))","This research/project is supported by A*STAR under its RIE2020 Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering (AME) Programmtic Programme(Award A19E3b0099).","","13","7","7","0","2","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-0-7381-0495-9","","","","2020","","","","","","","337","342","","10.1109/Blockchain50366.2020.00049","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain50366.2020.00049","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR3LS","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000647642100040","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We use a model-checking tool (UPPAAL-SMC) to examine the security of proof-of-work consensus by varying protocol parameters, using an adversary that leverages the selfish mining strategy introduced in [4]. We provide insights into modeling proof-of-work protocols and demonstrate trade-offs between operating parameters. Applying this methodology to protocol design, we show that the uniform tie-breaking rule from [11], an attempt to mitigate selfish mining, improves chain quality but decreases the common prefix probability.

The Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) will be saved as a file on the IPFS network during optimization. In this way, the miner node can quickly get the file and start mining. The ultimate goal is to optimize the storage space for the node and to increase the synchronization efficiency of the newly added miner node. The simulation experiment of the proposed optimization scheme is carried out. The experimental results show that the scheme can summarize the historical transaction data regularly, eliminate the Spent Transaction Output (STXO) which has no effect on the verification transaction, so as to effectively reduce the node storage space.","[Gao, Junying; Li, Bo; Li, Zhihuai] Dalian Maritime Univ, Informat Coll, Dalian 116000, Peoples R China","Dalian Maritime University","Li, ZH (corresponding author), Dalian Maritime Univ, Informat Coll, Dalian 116000, Peoples R China.","junying@dlmu.edu.cn; libo9281@163.com; qhlee@dlmu.edu.cn","","","","","","","9","0","0","1","7","SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD","SINGAPORE","152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE","1876-1100","1876-1119","978-981-13-6508-9; 978-981-13-6507-2","LECT NOTES ELECTR EN","","","2020","517","","","","","","922","932","","10.1007/978-981-13-6508-9_112","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-6508-9_112","","","11","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology; Telecommunications","BQ6RE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000613003400112","View Full Record in Web of Science"

For risk estimation and usability aspects of Bitcoin applications, it is necessary to know the time required to disseminate a transaction within the network. Unfortunately, this time is not immediately obvious and hard to acquire. Measuring the dissemination latency requires many connections into the Bitcoin network, wasting network resources. Some third parties operate that way and publish large scale measurements. Relying on these measurements introduces a dependency and requires additional trust. This work describes how to unobtrusively acquire reliable estimates of the dissemination latencies for transactions without involving a third party. The dissemination latency is modelled with a lognormal distribution, and we estimate their parameters using a Bayesian model that can be updated dynamically. Our approach provides reliable estimates even when using only eight connections, the minimum connection number used by the default Bitcoin client. We provide an implementation of our approach as well as datasets for modelling and evaluation. Our approach, while slightly underestimating the latency distribution, is largely congruent with observed dissemination latencies.","[Moedinger, David; van der Heijden, Rens W.; Hauck, Franz J.] Ulm Univ, Inst Distributed Syst, Ulm, Germany; [Lorenz, Jan-Hendrik] Ulm Univ, Inst Theoret Comp Sci, Ulm, Germany","Ulm University; Ulm University","Modinger, D (corresponding author), Ulm Univ, Inst Distributed Syst, Ulm, Germany.","david.moedinger@uni-ulm.de","","Hauck, Franz J./0000-0002-7480-9617; Modinger, David/0000-0002-5917-2419","","","","","28","2","2","0","1","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","DEC 10","2020","15","12","","","","","","","e0243475","10.1371/journal.pone.0243475","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243475","","","21","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","PH0WB","33301472","Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000600143100041","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this paper, we introduce another oversampling technique using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to generate artificial training data for classification model. In order to verify similarity between artificial data and the actual one, oversampled dataset is evaluated with a classification model using XGBoost algorithm.

We apply cross wavelet transform and wavelet coherence analysis with a wavelet-based measure of value at risk. The comovement is stronger and in the same direction at lower frequencies, suggesting the benefits from diversification with BTC are relatively less for long-term investors compared to short-term investors. Co-movement in the opposite direction at high frequencies implies better benefits of hedging in the short run through diversification in BTC and Islamic equity markets. Robustness tests show that the correlations increase as we increase from an investment horizon of two days to one of 64 days. The frequency-domain causality test shows significant causality flow from BTC to the Islamic market of Asia-Pacific, Japan, and Sukuk markets in the short term. Additionally, BTC is found to lead Asia-Pacific Islamic stock markets in the long term.

Simulating the BTC market in the price discovery process presents a unique set of market mechanics. The supply of BTC is determined by the number of miners and available BTC and by scripting algorithms for blockchain hashing, while both speculators and investors determine demand. One major question then is to understand how BTC is valued and how different factors influence it. In this paper, the BTC market mechanics are broken down using vector autoregression (VAR) and Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) prediction models. The models proved to be very useful in simulating past BTC prices using a feature set of exogenous variables. The VAR model allows the analysis of individual factors of influence. This analysis contributes to an in-depth understanding of what drives BTC, and it can be useful to numerous stakeholders. This paper's primary motivation is to capitalize on market movement and identify the significant price drivers, including stakeholders impacted, effects of time, as well as supply, demand, and other characteristics. The two VAR and BVAR models are compared with some state-of-the-art forecasting models over two time periods. Experimental results show that the vector-autoregression-based models achieved better performance compared to the traditional autoregression models and the Bayesian regression models.","[Ibrahim, Ahmed] Wilfried Laurier Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Kashef, Rasha; Li, Menglu] Ryerson Univ, Elect Comp & Biomed Engn Dept, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada; [Valencia, Esteban] IVEY Business Sch, Management Sci Dept, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada; [Huang, Eric] Adv Analyt & Res Lab, Toronto, ON M5J 2P1, Canada","Toronto Metropolitan University","Kashef, R (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Elect Comp & Biomed Engn Dept, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada.","ahibrahim@wlu.ca; rkashef@ryerson.ca; menglu.li@ryerson.ca; evalencia.msc2017@ivey.ca; ehuang.msc2017@ivey.ca","Ibrahim, Ahmed/HGB-1313-2022","","","","","","37","10","10","2","5","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

We have performed queuing analysis of the BTC network and obtained performance descriptors of block and transaction delivery times as well as forking probability. Although compact block size is more than an order of magnitude smaller than regular block size, improvement of delivery times is within bounds of 0% to 20%. Forking probability shows highest improvement of 25%.

Therefore. Blockchain is a linked list structure but may be changed to a fork structure; a useful fork or a malicious fork. The useful fork may occur when the rules of the block are updated. On the other side, the malicious fork occurs when a miner has supercomputer properties that generate a set of blocks as a branch and does not publish this branch to the blockchain until the length of that branch is greater than the length of the main branch, or when two blocks saved at the same time in the blockchain. When these forks occur in the system, a set of blockchain transactions will be rollbacked, user waiting times increases, and miner rewards increases illegally. In this paper, a Lightweight algorithm is proposed to avoid the malicious fork issue, and therefore rollback issue, users waiting time is reduced in the transaction process. The proposed algorithm is to make a single publisher in the system and divides the block construction into two phases. In the first phase, a miner generates a block and sends it to the memory pool. In the second phase, the memory pool will publish the block to the blockchain. The results show that the proposed algorithm has a good ability to avoid the malicious fork issue in the blockchain and the rollback issue thus minimize user waiting times.","[Madkour, Ahmed H.; Abdelkader, Hatem M.; Elsaid, Asmaa] Fac Comp & Informat, Informat Syst, Menoufia, Egypt","","Madkour, AH (corresponding author), Fac Comp & Informat, Informat Syst, Menoufia, Egypt.","hamdymadkour@ei.menofia.edu.eg; hatem.abdelkader@ei.menofia.edu.eg; asmaa.elsayed@ei.menofia.edu.eg","","","","","","","18","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-6654-1517-0","","","","2020","","","","","","","36","42","","10.1109/ICCTA52020.2020.9477688","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCTA52020.2020.9477688","","","7","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT3IZ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000820608700006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In order to overcome that, similar investments tools/portfolios should be analysed simultaneously by different VaR methods for comparison. Considering such overcome, this study is aimed to compare the VaR (value at risk) estimation methodologies for all 5 separated portfolios (which are similar considering their liquidity and investment process) holding USD, EUR, GOLD, BIST100 Index (Istanbul Stock Exchange Index) and BITCOIN considering their daily return on TRL (Turkish Lira).

The results of such analyses backed with different backtests indicated the different VaR methods performance for the different portfolios. Such results support the idea that, for the similar portfolios, different VaR methodologies and different backtesting process must be applied for the best fit.","[Karahanoglu, Ilhami] AP Consulting, Ankara, Turkey","","Karahanoglu, I (corresponding author), AP Consulting, Ankara, Turkey.","ilhamikarahanoglu@hotmail.com","","","","","","","42","1","1","1","3","UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA, CENTRUL STUDII EUROPENE","IASI","BULEVARDUL CAROL I, NR 19, IASI, 700507, ROMANIA","2068-651X","2068-6633","","EAST J EUR STUD","East.

Specifically, we posit that applying whole number bias theory, from the cognitive psychology and mathematics fields, to Bitcoin's unit of measurement will allow the value of Bitcoin to be referenced in smaller and easier to understand units with fewer numbers after the decimal point-such as the Bit or the Satoshi.

The implementation of the proposed model includes a likelihood ratio test that allows to compare models with different states and with different covariance structures. Our empirical findings show that the time movements of Bitcoin prices across different exchange markets are well-described by the proposed model. In particular, a parsimonious model with a diagonal covariance matrix leads to better predictions, compared with a model with a full covariance matrix.","[Giudici, Paolo] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Pavia, Italy; [Abu Hashish, Iman] Univ Pavia, Dept Elect Comp & Biomed Engn, Pavia, Italy","University of Pavia; University of Pavia","Giudici, P (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dept Econ, Via S Felice 5, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.","giudici@unipv.it","Giudici, Paolo/AAA-5126-2021; Giudici, Paolo/AAA-7773-2021","Giudici, Paolo/0000-0002-4198-0127; Abu Hashish, Iman/0000-0002-2345-8140","European Union's research and innovation program FIN-TECH: A Financial supervision and Technology compliance training programme [825215]; European Union's Horizon 2020 [825215]","European Union's research and innovation program FIN-TECH: A Financial supervision and Technology compliance training programme; European Union's Horizon 2020","European Union's research and innovation program FIN-TECH: A Financial supervision and Technology compliance training programme, Grant/Award Number: 825215 (Topic: ICT-35-2018 and Type of action: CSA).; European Union's Horizon 2020, Grant/Award Number: 825215","","18","4","4","2","12","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0748-8017","1099-1638","","QUAL RELIAB ENG INT","Qual.

Social media, such as Twitter, plays a significant role as a meaningful indicator in forecasting the Bitcoin (BTC) prices. However, there is a research gap in determining the optimal preprocessing strategy in BTC tweets to develop an accurate machine learning prediction model for bitcoin prices. This paper develops different text preprocessing strategies for correlating the sentiment scores of Twitter text with Bitcoin prices during the COVID-19 pandemic. We explore the effect of different preprocessing functions, features, and time lengths of data on the correlation results. Out of 13 strategies, we discover that splitting sentences, removing Twitter-specific tags, or their combination generally improve the correlation of sentiment scores and volume polarity scores with Bitcoin prices. The prices only correlate well with sentiment scores over shorter timespans. Selecting the optimum preprocessing strategy would prompt machine learning prediction models to achieve better accuracy as compared to the actual prices.","[Pano, Toni; Kashef, Rasha] Ryerson Univ, Elect Comp & Biomed Engn, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada","Toronto Metropolitan University","Kashef, R (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Elect Comp & Biomed Engn, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada.","toni.pano@ryerson.ca; rkashef@ryerson.ca","","","Ryerson University, Faculty of Engineering Undergraduate Opportunity Fund - Ryerson Start-up fund","Ryerson University, Faculty of Engineering Undergraduate Opportunity Fund - Ryerson Start-up fund","This research was funded by Ryerson University, Faculty of Engineering Undergraduate Opportunity Fund and The APC was funded by Ryerson Start-up fund.","","30","22","22","9","16","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2504-2289","","BIG DATA COGN COMPUT","Big Data Cogn.

Design/methodology/approach A daily composite political risk index is calculated by using the principal component analysis and Google Trends. A quantile regression approach is adopted to assess the effect of the political risk index on Bitcoin return and volatility for both periods subject to market conditions. Findings Findings reveal that the political risk index tends to increase when moving from the pre-election period to the post-election one. This is mostly attributed to the new challenges faced by the new elected government. During the pre-election period, the quantiles regression shows that the political risk index negatively affects Bitcoin return when the market is bearish, whereas a positive impact on volatility is found in bearish and bullish markets. When the political situation becomes severer during the post-election period, the quantiles plots show that the increase of the political risk index leads to a significant increase of Bitcoin return, whereas Bitcoin volatility remains relatively stable. This means that Bitcoin can be adopted as a hedging tool when the political situation becomes severer. Originality/value Comparing to the existed studies in the field, this paper considers Google trends as a main source to assess the daily composite political risk index during the 2016 US presidential election.","[Ajmi, Hechem] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, IIUM Inst Islamic Banking & Finance, Gombak, Selangor, Malaysia; [Arfaoui, Nadia] Univ Manouba, ESCT Business Sch Tunis, Manouba, Tunisia","International Islamic University Malaysia; Universite de la Manouba","Ajmi, H (corresponding author), Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, IIUM Inst Islamic Banking & Finance, Gombak, Selangor, Malaysia.","hechemajmi@gmail.com; arfaouinadia23@gmail.com","","","","","","","54","2","2","1","2","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1757-6385","1757-6393","","J FINAN ECON POLICY","J.

One of the main problems with decentralized cryptocurrencies is price volatility, which indicates the need for studying the underlying price model. Moreover, Bitcoin prices exhibit non-stationary behavior, where the statistical distribution of data changes over time. This paper demonstrates high-performance machine learning-based classification and regression models for predicting Bitcoin price movements and prices in short and medium terms. In previous works, machine learning-based classification has been studied for an only one-day time frame, while this work goes beyond that by using machine learning-based models for one, seven, thirty and ninety days. The developed models are feasible and have high performance, with the classification models scoring up to 65% accuracy for next-day forecast and scoring from 62 to 64% accuracy for seventh-ninetieth-day forecast. For daily price forecast, the error percentage is as low as 1.44%, while it varies from 2.88 to 4.10% for horizons of seven to ninety days. These results indicate that the presented models outperform the existing models in the literature.","[Mudassir, Mohammed; Bennbaia, Shada] Qatar Univ, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Doha, Qatar; [Unal, Devrim] Qatar Univ, KINDI Ctr Comp Res, Doha, Qatar; [Hammoudeh, Mohammad] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Comp & Math, Manchester, Lancs, England","Qatar University; Qatar University; Manchester Metropolitan University","Unal, D (corresponding author), Qatar Univ, KINDI Ctr Comp Res, Doha, Qatar.","mh1204033@student.qu.edu.qa; sb1209176@student.qu.edu.qa; dunal@qu.edu.qa; M.Hammoudeh@mmu.ac.uk","Unal, Devrim/ABH-1335-2021; Hammoudeh, Mohammad/A-5797-2012; Unal, Devrim/GVS-1028-2022; Mudassir, Mohammed/H-5928-2012","Unal, Devrim/0000-0003-3146-3502; Hammoudeh, Mohammad/0000-0003-1058-0996; Mudassir, Mohammed/0000-0002-0093-1257; Hammoudeh, Mohammad Ali A./0000-0002-9735-2365","Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation) [NPRP10-0125-170250]","Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation)","This publication was made possible by NPRP Grant NPRP10-0125-170250 from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation).

To date, literature on the major cryptocurrencies price processes does not address jointly and comprehensively their fractal properties, long memory and wavelet analysis, that could robustly confirm the presence of fractal dynamics in their prices, and confirm or deny the validity of the Fractal Market Hypothesis as being applicable to the cryptocurrencies. This research shows that Bitcoin prices exhibit long term memory, although its trend has been reducing overtime. In fact, assessing Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple across the period between 2016 and 2017, focusing solely on the period prior to the crash of 2018, we can conclude that Bitcoin was better described by a random walk, showing signs of markets maturity emerging, in contrast, other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Ripple present evidence of a growing underlying memory behaviour.

One technological development, the cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin, holds the potential to both democratize access to capital and facilitate transactions without the need for a central actor. Unfortunately, Bitcoin can just as easily be used for nefarious activities such as money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. As Bitcoin has become more mainstream, federal authorities have enjoyed some success applying existing laws-including the Bank Secrecy Act-to the Bitcoin ecosystem and cryptocurrency exchanges that facilitate the buying and selling of Bitcoin. Following the Supreme Court's recent and revolutionary decision in Carpenter v. United States-which establishes a new framework for evaluating privacy in the digital age-however, the Bank Secrecy Act's constitutionality as applied to Bitcoin may be in jeopardy. This Note explores the impact Carpenter may have on the Bank Secrecy Act in the context of Bitcoin and what Congress can do to resolve that uncertainty. Because there is a significant possibility that Carpenter's reasoning may be extended to protect certain data on the Bitcoin network, this Note urges Congress to amend the Bank Secrecy Act to lessen the chance that a constitutional challenge against the Act will be successful. In modifying the Bank Secrecy Act, Congress can bolster privacy protections while simultaneously retaining law enforcement's ability to use the statute to combat the types of financial crimes the law was designed to stop.","[Lloyd, Christopher] George Washington Univ, Law Sch, Washington, DC 20052 USA","George Washington University","Lloyd, C (corresponding author), George Washington Univ, Law Sch, Washington, DC 20052 USA.","","","","","","","","109","0","0","0","3","GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIV","WASHINGTON","2000 H STREET N W, WASHINGTON, DC 20052 USA","0016-8076","","","GEORGE WASH LAW REV","George Wash.

Using daily data for the three major cryptocurrencies, namely Ripple, Ethereum, and Bitcoin, we test for the long memory property using, Rescaled Range Statistics (R/S), Gaussian Semi Parametric (GSP) and the Geweke and Porter-Hudak (GPH) Model Method. Our findings show that squared returns of three cryptocurrencies have a significant long memory, supporting the use of fractional Generalized Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) extensions as suitable modelling technique. Our findings indicate that the Hyperbolic GARCH (HYGARCH) model appears to be the best fitted model for Bitcoin. On the other hand, the Fractional Integrated GARCH (FIGARCH) model with skewed student distribution produces better estimations for Ethereum. Finally, FIGARCH model with student distribution appears to give a good fit for Ripple return. Based on Kupieck's tests for Value at Risk (VaR) back-testing and expected shortfalls we can conclude that our models perform correctly in most of the cases for both the negative and positive returns.","[Soylu, Pinar Kaya] Marmara Univ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Business Informat, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey; [Okur, Mustafa] Marmara Univ, Sch Banking & Insurance, Dept Capital Markets, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey; [Catikkas, Ozgur] Marmara Univ, Sch Banking & Insurance, Dept Insurance, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey; [Altintig, Z.

While rai were not strictly currency, their value is similar to other traditional and modern objects where worth is arbitrarily based on both real and perceived attributes. Recently, corollaries have been made between rai and newly established electronic cryptocurrencies that use blockchain technology-essentially, digital ledgers that track financial transactions in real time across a computer network to ensure that they are seamless and incorruptible. In this study, we examine the sociophysical similarities and differences between stone money and cryptocurrencies that rely on blockchain, both of which demand a unified and continuous chain of information to ensure that the value is known and ownership indisputable. This research suggests that stone money: (a) is an exemplary ancient analog to blockchain that used oral ledgers solidified through social networks to create accurate and unbroken lines of communication so that economic relationships involving rai could be established, maintained, exchanged, and rectified, and (b) may have been a progenitor that inspired the development of Bitcoin.","[Fitzpatrick, Scott M.] Univ Oregon, Dept Anthropol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Fitzpatrick, Scott M.] Univ Oregon, Museum Nat & Cultural Hist, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [McKeon, Stephen] Univ Oregon, Lundquist Coll Business, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","University of Oregon; University of Oregon; University of Oregon","Fitzpatrick, SM (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Anthropol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.;Fitzpatrick, SM (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Museum Nat & Cultural Hist, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.","smfitzpa@cas.uoregon.edu","",", Stephen/0000-0002-3202-2728","Palau Bureau of Cultural and Historical Preservation; Yap Historic Preservation Office","Palau Bureau of Cultural and Historical Preservation; Yap Historic Preservation Office","We thank the Palau Bureau of Cultural and Historical Preservation and the Yap Historic Preservation Office for their support of this research over the last twenty years.

We show that abnormal returns are linked to the performance of bitcoin. Additionally, speculative announcements exhibit higher returns than non-speculative announcements, and blockchain-related Form 8-K disclosures have negligible difference in performance compared to their U.S. peers.

We find that the total sentiment spillover among crude oil, gold and Bitcoin markets is time-varying and is greatly affected by major market events. The directional sentiment spillovers are also time-varying. On average, the Bitcoin market is the major transmitter of directional sentiment spillovers, whereas the crude oil and gold markets are the major receivers. In particular, the sentiment spillover effects are major created at high-frequency components, implying that the markets rapidly process the sentiment spillover effects and the shock is transmitted over the short-term. Moreover, we also find that the sentiment spillover effects differ significantly in term of intensity and direction when compared with return and volatility spillover effects.

In choreographies, control over a process instance is shared between independent parties, and no party has full control or knowledge during process runtime. Nevertheless, it is necessary to monitor and verify process instances during runtime for purposes of documentation, accounting, or compensation. To achieve business process runtime verification, this work explores the suitability of the Bitcoin blockchain to create a novel solution for choreographies. The resulting approach is realized in a fully-functional software prototype. This software solution is evaluated in a qualitative comparison. Findings show that our blockchain-based approach enables a seamless execution monitoring and verification of choreographies, while at the same time preserving anonymity and independence of the process participants. Furthermore, the prototype is evaluated in a performance analysis. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We identify that all the seven marketplaces use the same software to manage Bitcoin by investigating transactions in these marketplaces. However, the software was no longer used since May 2016 because of its vulnerability to protect anonymity. It indicates that dark web marketplaces advanced to the next stage with anonymity-enhancing tools around in March 2016. Using simple heuristics to identify and trace Bitcoin addresses associated with these marketplaces, purchases on these marketplaces are identified and evaluated. Our method provides evidence on market size, development, and fluctuation over time to fill a gap in previous studies. Dark web marketplaces continue to thrive because users migrate to new marketplaces after the existing ones are shut down. The total sales volume on Silk Road was 192.7 million US dollars between June 2012 and October 2013. The corresponding figures for Silk Road 2.0, Agora, Evolution, Nucleus, and Abraxas were 112.9, 220.7, 69.7, 88.3, and 35.6 million US dollars, respectively.

This paper examined a total of 67,166 panel data of financial stocks in the two emerging markets of Taiwan and China between July 2016 and April 2019, presenting the following significant findings. (1) Financial stocks in Taiwan's market are more greatly shocked by the bitcoin and interaction effect between bitcoin and fin-tech than those in China's market. (2) Even after changing proxy variable or autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity are considered, the asymmetric shocks on financial stocks in Taiwan's market are still great. (3) The effects of the two variables of bitcoin and interaction with fin-tech on financial stocks are consistently important as the three-factor CAPM model.

Results show that Bitcoin behaves differently to traditional currencies. Traditional currencies typically experience a decrease in returns after negative news arrivals and an increase in returns following positive news whereas Bitcoin reacts positively to both positive and negative news. This suggests investor enthusiasm for Bitcoin irrespective of the sentiment of the news. This phenomenon is exacerbated during bubble periods. Conversely, cryptocurrency cyber-attack news and fraud news dampen this effect, decreasing Bitcoin returns and volatility. Our results contribute to the discussion on the nature of Bitcoin as a currency or an asset. They further inform practitioners about the characteristics of cryptocurrencies as a financial asset and inform regulators about the influence of news on Bitcoin volatility, particularly during bubble periods.","[Rognone, Lavinia; Hyde, Stuart; Zhang, S.

This can help banks in categorizing their customers so that banks can recommend financial products that matches the needs of their customers. In this work, we explored the historical financial transactions for predicting the amount a customer will receive through his/her transacting partners at a specific time. In particular, we use the Bitcoin transactional dataset, which has two main characteristics: i) network, and ii) temporal. This paper contributes by exploiting a specific kind of Graph Neural Network approach called Temporal-Graph Convolutional Network (T-GCN) for predicting the amount of Bitcoins received by a customer at a particular timestamp. The lower errors obtained using T-GCN approach compared to 11 baseline approaches (such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), etc.) clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of T-GCN approach. In addition, our findings reveal that time is an important feature for such kind of predictive tasks.","[Sharma, Shakshi; Sharma, Rajesh] Univ Tartu, Inst Comp Sci, Tartu, Estonia","University of Tartu","Sharma, S (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Inst Comp Sci, Tartu, Estonia.","shakshi.sharma@ut.ee; rajesh.sharma@ut.ee","","","H2020 SoBigData++ project","H2020 SoBigData++ project","This research is financially supported by H2020 SoBigData++ project.","","45","0","0","3","6","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2473-9928","2473-991X","978-1-7281-1056-1","PR I-A I C AD S N A","","","2020","","","","","","","478","485","","10.1109/ASONAM49781.2020.9381363","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM49781.2020.9381363","","","8","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Social Issues; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Computer Science; Social Issues; Social Sciences - Other Topics","BR9NK","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000678816900076","View Full Record in Web of Science"

First, we propose a new structure for the Bitcoin network called double-layer dynamic network, which improves the defense capability of Bitcoin against several attacks. Second, we design a new structure for the blocks in the Bitcoin network, which provides a way to store the IP addresses in the blocks. Third, we present a novel network protocol named dynamic network configuration for public blockchain. Our protocol pushes the updating of IP addresses in the blocks and changes the construction of the network periodically.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are not a safe haven for the majority of international equity markets examined, with their inclusion adding to portfolio downside risk. Only investors in the Chinese CSI 300 index realized modest downside risk benefits (contingent on very limited allocations to Bitcoin or Ethereum). As Tether successfully maintained its peg to the US dollar during the COVID-19 turmoil, it acted as a safe haven investment for all of the international indices examined. We caveat the latter findings with a warning that Tether's dollar peg has not always been maintained, with evidence of impaired downside risk hedging properties earlier in our sample.","[Conlon, Thomas; McGee, Richard J.] Univ Coll Dublin, Smurfit Grad Sch Business, Dublin, Ireland; [Corbet, Shaen] Dublin City Univ, DCU Business Sch, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Corbet, Shaen] Univ Waikato, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand","University College Dublin; Dublin City University; University of Waikato","Mcgee, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Smurfit Grad Sch Business, Dublin, Ireland.","richard.mcgee@ucd.ie","Corbet, Shaen/B-4869-2017","Corbet, Shaen/0000-0001-7430-7417","Science Foundation Ireland [16/SPP/3347, 13/RC/2106, 17/SP/5447]","Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation IrelandEuropean Commission)","This publication has emanated from research conducted with the financial support of Science Foundation Ireland under Grant Numbers 16/SPP/3347, 13/RC/2106 and 17/SP/5447.","","41","186","186","26","86","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0275-5319","1878-3384","","RES INT BUS FINANC","Res.

Expanding upon previously calculated energy use patterns for mining four prominent cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero), we estimate the per coin economic damages of air pollution emissions and associated human mortality and climate impacts of mining these cryptocurrencies in the US and China. Results indicate that in 2018, each $1 of Bitcoin value created was responsible for $0.49 in health and climate damages in the US and $0.37 in China. The similar value in China relative to the US occurs despite the extremely large disparity between the value of a statistical life estimate for the US relative to that of China. Further, with each cryptocurrency, the rising electricity requirements to produce a single coin can lead to an almost inevitable cliff of negative net social benefits, absent perpetual price increases. For example, in December 2018, our results illustrate a case (for Bitcoin) where the health and climate change cryptodamages roughly match each $1 of coin value created. We close with discussion of policy implications.","[Goodkind, Andrew L.; Jones, Benjamin A.; Berrens, Robert P.] Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","University of New Mexico","Jones, BA (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.","bajones@unm.edu","","","Center for Air, Climate, and Energy Solutions (CACES) - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [R835873]","Center for Air, Climate, and Energy Solutions (CACES) - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency","The air quality model used in this publication was developed as part of the Center for Air, Climate, and Energy Solutions (CACES), which was supported under Assistance Agreement No. R835873 awarded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

We then propose a simple commit-delay-reveal protocol, which allows users to securelymove their funds from non-quantum-resistant outputs to those adhering to a quantum-resistant digital signature scheme. In a previous paper (Stewart et al. R. Soc. Open Sci. 5(6), 180410 (2018)) [1] we presented a similar scheme with a long fixed delay. Here we improve on our previous work, by allowing each user to choose their preferred delay-long for a low risk of attack, or short if a higher risk is acceptable to that user. As before, our scheme requires modifications to the Bitcoin protocol, but once again these can be implemented as a soft fork.","[Ilie, Dragos I.; Knottenbelt, William J.; Stewart, Iain D.] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Cryptocurrency Res & Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England","Imperial College London","Stewart, ID (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Ctr Cryptocurrency Res & Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England.","ids@imperial.ac.uk; dii14@imperial.ac.uk; wjk@imperial.ac.uk","","","","","","","34","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","2198-7246","2198-7254","978-3-030-37110-4; 978-3-030-37109-8","SPR PROC BUS ECON","","","2020","","","","","","","117","132","","10.1007/978-3-030-37110-4_9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-37110-4_9","","","16","Business; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics; Computer Science; Mathematics","BR9FH","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000675370400008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We gather data and analyze user and network activity that highly impact the price of these cryptocurrencies. We monitor the change in the activities over time and relate them to economic theories. We identify key network features that help us to determine the demand and supply dynamics in a cryptocurrency. Finally, we use machine learning methods to construct models that predict Bitcoin price.

In order to do so, we introduce an asset pricing model and modify its properties to make it applicable to cryptocurrency markets. We group the risk factors into market related and Bitcoin- and Ethereum blockchain specific risk factors. We find that blockchain specific risk factors are priced in.

Methodology / approach: The study gathered information treated using the quantitative method and a field survey. It was decided to use the AR (p) autoregressive model as a technique, looking for the return by means of the unconditional average AR (p) and the unconditional variance ARCH (p) or EGARCH (p, q). Originality / Relevance: In Brazil, there are different types of investments. For some investors, electronic currencies have become a type of investment comparable to gold or the dollar. This study aimed to show investors how bitcoin can be used as an investment alternative. Main results: Since the beginning of 2017, there has been an increase in the value of bitcoin, reaching the value of USD13,411.00 on December 31, 2017. The sudden overvaluation and the increase in the number of users have awakened analysts, states and investors to look at the currency's volatility issue. The period from 2015 to 2017 was analyzed to calculate the volatility of assets and bitcoin. Theoretical / methodological contributions: The results obtained revealed the degree of knowledge of the participants in relation to financial applications, a possible profile for bitcoin investors, the profitability and volatility of the compared assets, enabling the comparison of bitcoin with other variable income assets.","[de Miranda, Maria Geralda; Santos Avelar, Katia Eliane] UNISUAM, Programa Posgrad Desenvolvimento Local, Ctr Univ Augusto Motta, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil","Centro Universitario Augusto Motta (UNISUAM)","","rubestrjrj@gmail.com; mgeraldamiranda@gmail.com; katia.avelar@gmail.com","AVELAR, KATIA ELIANE SANTOS/AAH-8055-2021","AVELAR, KATIA ELIANE SANTOS/0000-0002-7883-9442","","","","","17","0","0","2","5","FUNDACAO PEDRO LEOPOLDO","PEDRO LEOPOLDO","AV LINCOLN DIOGO VIANA 830, PEDRO LEOPOLDO, MG 33600-000, BRAZIL","1677-9479","2177-6652","","REV GEST TECNOL","Rev.

In this paper, we model the emergence of the Lightning Network as a (bond) percolation process and we explore how the distributional properties of the volume and size of transactions per user may impact its feasibility. The agents are all able to reciprocally transfer Bitcoins using the main blockchain and also - if economically convenient - to open a channel on the Lightning Network and transact off chain. We base our approach on fitness-dependent network models: as in real life, a Lightning channel is opened with a probability that depends on the fitness of the concurring nodes, which in turn depends on wealth and volume of transactions. The emergence of a connected component is studied numerically and analytically as a function of the parameters, and the phase transition separating regions in the phase space where the Lightning Network is sustainable or not is elucidated. We characterize the phase diagram determining the minimal volume of transactions that would make the Lightning Network sustainable for a given level of fees or, alternatively, the maximal cost the Lightning ecosystem may impose for a given average volume of transactions. The model includes parameters that could be in principle estimated from publicly available data once the evolution of the Lighting Network will have reached a stationary operable state, and is fairly robust against different choices of the distributions of parameters and fitness kernels.","[Bartolucci, Silvia] Imperial Coll London, Business Sch South Kensington, Dept Finance, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Caccioli, Fabio] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, 66-72 Gower St, London WC1E 6EA, England; [Vivo, Pierpaolo] Kings Coll London, Dept Math, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Bartolucci, Silvia; Caccioli, Fabio] UCL, Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England; [Caccioli, Fabio] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Syst Risk Ctr, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England","Imperial College London; University of London; University College London; University of London; King's College London; University of London; University College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science","Vivo, P (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Dept Math, London WC2R 2LS, England.","pierpaolo.vivo@kcl.ac.uk","","Vivo, Pierpaolo/0000-0002-2366-3080","UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies as part of the 1st Internal Call for Project Proposals on Distributed Ledger Technologies; UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship grant [MR/S03174X/1]; ESRC [ES/K002309/1, ES/R009724/1] Funding Source: UKRI","UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies as part of the 1st Internal Call for Project Proposals on Distributed Ledger Technologies; UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship grant; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","S.B. and F.C. acknowledge funding by UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies as part of the 1st Internal Call for Project Proposals on Distributed Ledger Technologies.

Furthermore, bitcoin price forecasting has been a vital research trend, where machine learning techniques play a substantial role. A sophisticated and appropriately trained model can be useless if the features being tested are unreliable. Independently, one of the most desirable aspects of a system that utilizes the blockchain is the concrete objectiveness by which each entry is cataloged.

The choice of this topic was motivated by the fact that the virtual money concept and blockchain technology are utterly new phenomena. This new technology is completely decentralized making the subject worthy of scientific research.The paper solely focuses on analyzing how cryptocurrencies currently affect the financial markets and the future trends of these virtual tokens in the global economy. The study is keen to further examine the impact of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on international fund transfers. Literature review and case study with up-to-date data has been included in the analysis. The following results have been obtained: cryptocurrencies offer a wide range of features such as faster, cheaper and more secure cross-border money transfers that can also provide anonymity. Most crypto tokens are highly volatile due to their nature and various other factors. Cryptocurrencies could provide more beneficial options for users on cross border transfers compared to traditional methods of fund transfers. Cryptocurrencies might have the potential to replace paper money and gain mainstream recognition throughout the world. The study sheds light onto current and future trends of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. It is outlined for the crypto, financial, economic field.","","","","burakuyduran@outlook.com","","Uyduran, Burak/0000-0002-4819-2764","","","","","34","0","0","1","9","WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH","BERLIN","GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY","","2719-3454","","FINANC INTERNET Q","Financ.

The mining pool, which is considered the source of Bitcoin, is the cornerstone of market stability. The surveillance of the mining pool can help regulators effectively assess the overall health of Bitcoin and issues. However, the anonymity of mining-pool miners and the difficulty of analyzing large numbers of transactions limit in-depth analysis. It is also a challenge to achieve intuitive and comprehensive monitoring of multi-source heterogeneous data. In this study, we present SuPoolVisor, an interactive visual analytics system that supports surveillance of the mining pool and de-anonymization by visual reasoning. SuPoolVisor is divided into pool level and address level. At the pool level, we use a sorted stream graph to illustrate the evolution of computing power of pools over time, and glyphs are designed in two other views to demonstrate the influence scope of the mining pool and the migration of pool members. At the address level, we use a force-directed graph and a massive sequence view to present the dynamic address network in the mining pool. Particularly, these two views, together with the Radviz view, support an iterative visual reasoning process for de-anonymization of pool members and provide interactions for cross-view analysis and identity marking. Effectiveness and usability of SuPoolVisor are demonstrated using three cases, in which we cooperate closely with experts in this field.","[Xia, Jia-zhi; Zhang, Yu-hong; Ye, Hui; Wang, Ying; Jiang, Guang; Zhao, Ying; Kui, Xiao-yan; Liao, Sheng-hui; Wang, Wei-ping] Cent South Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China; [Xie, Cong] Facebook, New York, NY 10003 USA","Central South University; Facebook Inc","Zhao, Y (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China.","zhaoying@csu.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61872389, 61502540, 61672538, 61872388, 61772556]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China [2015JJ4077, 2019JJ40406, 2017JJ2330]; Changsha Science and Technology Plan Key Project, China [kq1801066]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University, China [2018zzts065]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); Changsha Science and Technology Plan Key Project, China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University, China","Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61872389, 61502540, 61672538, 61872388, and 61772556), the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China (Nos. 2015JJ4077, 2019JJ40406, and 2017JJ2330), the Changsha Science and Technology Plan Key Project, China (No. kq1801066), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University, China (No. 2018zzts065)","","67","14","16","9","35","ZHEJIANG UNIV","HANGZHOU","EDITORIAL BOARD, 20 YUGU RD, HANGZHOU, 310027, PEOPLES R CHINA","2095-9184","2095-9230","","FRONT INFORM TECH EL","Front.

This scheme creates a distributed key generation system for bitcoin that removes the necessity for any centralised control list minimising any threat of fraud or attack. In the application of threshold-based solutions for DSA to ECDSA, we have created an entirely distributive signature system for bitcoin that mitigates against any single point of failure. When coupled with retrieval schemes involving CLTV and multisig wallets, our solution provides an infinitely extensible and secure means of deploying bitcoin.

Risk-minimizing hedge ratios are calculated following the methods used in studies by Kroner and Sultan (1993) and Sadorsky (2012). Findings The empirical results show a high degree of correlation of blockchain ETF returns with returns of the NASDAQ Composite Index, while the level of comovement with Bitcoin is relatively low. Research limitations/implications The results imply that blockchain ETFs may be suitable for hedging purposes in a portfolio holding Bitcoin. Furthermore, investing in blockchain ETFs appears similar to investing in NASDAQ.

As such, the question naturally arises: how have cryptocurrencies evolved over time? Drawing on the theory of polycentric information commons and cryptocurrencies' historical similarities with another popular information commons (namely, Linux), we make predictions regarding what cryptocurrencies may look like in the future. Specifically, we focus on four important historical similarities: 1) support from online hacker communities, 2) pursuit of freedom, 3) criticism about features and use, and 4) proliferation of forks. We then predict that: 1) cryptocurrencies will become more pragmatic rather than ideological, 2) cryptocurrencies will become more diverse in terms of not only the underlying technology but also the intended audience, and 3) the core technology behind cryptocurrencies, called blockchain, will be successfully used beyond cryptocurrencies.","[Carvalho, Arthur] Miami Univ, Farmer Sch Business, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Sambhara, Chaitanya] Univ Texas Arlington, Coll Business, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Young, Patrick] Miami Univ, Farmer Sch Business, Informat Syst & Mkt, Oxford, OH 45056 USA","University System of Ohio; Miami University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington; University System of Ohio; Miami University","Carvalho, A (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Farmer Sch Business, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.","arthur.carvalho@miamioh.edu","","Sambhara, Chaitanya/0000-0002-2622-6660","","","","","36","4","4","2","9","ASSOC INFORMATION SYSTEMS","ATLANTA","GEORGIA STATE UNIV, 35 BROAD STREET, STE 916-917, ATLANTA, GA 30303 USA","1529-3181","","","COMMUN ASSOC INF SYS","Commun.

Classical DoS attacks, however, typically target a few servers and cannot scale to systems with many nodes. There have been no successful DoS attacks to date against prominent cryptocurrencies. We present Blockchain DoS (BDoS), the first incentive-based DoS attack that targets PoW cryptocurrencies. Unlike classical DoS, BDoS targets the system's mechanism design: It exploits the reward mechanism to discourage miner participation. Previous DoS attacks against PoW blockchains require an adversary's mining power to match that of all other miners. In contrast, BDoS can cause a blockchain to grind to a halt with significantly fewer resources, e.g., 21% as of March 2020 in Bitcoin, according to our empirical study. We find that Bitcoin's vulnerability to BDoS increases rapidly as the mining industry matures and profitability drops. BDoS differs from known attacks like Selfish Mining in its aim not to increase an adversary's revenue, but to disrupt the system. Although it bears some algorithmic similarity to those attacks, it introduces a new adversarial model, goals, algorithm, and gametheoretic analysis. Beyond its direct implications for operational blockchains, BDoS introduces the novel idea that an adversary can manipulate miners' incentives by proving the existence of blocks without actually publishing them.","[Mirkin, Michael; Eyal, Ittay] Technion, Haifa, Israel; [Mirkin, Michael; Ji, Yan; Eyal, Ittay; Juels, Ari] IC3, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Ji, Yan; Juels, Ari] Cornell Tech, New York, NY USA; [Pang, Jonathan; Klages-Mundt, Ariah] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Cornell University","Mirkin, M (corresponding author), Technion, Haifa, Israel.;Mirkin, M (corresponding author), IC3, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.","smirkin@campus.technion.ac.il; yj348@cornell.edu; jp2268@cornell.edu; aak228@cornell.edu; ittay@technion.ac.il; juels@cornell.edu","","","ISF [1641/18]; NSF [CNS-1514163, CNS-1564102, CNS-1704615]; BSF; Technion Cyber-Security Center; Mel Berlin Scholarship; Bloomberg Fellowship; IC3 industry partners; Engima MPC","ISF(Israel Science Foundation); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); BSF(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation); Technion Cyber-Security Center; Mel Berlin Scholarship; Bloomberg Fellowship; IC3 industry partners; Engima MPC","We thank the anonymous reviewers and our shepherd, Yongdae Kim, for their feedback and suggestions.

It is different from the traditional withholding attacks which always drop valid blocks. BWD attackers never discard blocks but they delay the submissions of blocks to the pool managers, resulting the pool failed in the mining competitions and loss of rewards. We analyzed the optimum strategy of a BWD attacker who split its computing power into two parts, one was utilized to launch BWD attacks on the victim pools, while the other part was used for solo mining. We present detailed quantitative analysis of the maximum incentive that an attacker can earn by carefully splitting its computing power, and demonstrated that the attacker can obtain higher incentives than its contribution to the network in different conditions. Furthermore, we proposed a countermeasure against BWD based on the interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy inference system (IT2-TSK-FIS). The principle is to modify the private payoff scheme of pools to increase the risk of losing revenues of the rogue miners who deliberately delay block submissions. The scheme dealing the uncertain cause of block delay using fuzzy inference, and it is so designed that it does not require modifications of public mining protocols or data structures of the bitcoin network, which makes it applicable in practical pools.","[Liu, Liang; Chen, Wen; Zhang, Lei; Liu, JiaYong] Sichuan Univ, Coll Cybersecur, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Liang] Sichuan Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Qin, Jian] Chengdu 7 High Sch, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Sichuan University; Sichuan University","Chen, W (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Coll Cybersecur, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.","wenchen@scu.edu.cn","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFB0800605, 2016YFB0800604]; Natural Science Foundation of China [61872255, U1736212, 61572334]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant nos. 2016YFB0800605 and 2016YFB0800604) and Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos.61872255, U1736212 and 61572334).","","30","3","3","0","4","AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS","SPRINGFIELD","PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA","1547-1063","1551-0018","","MATH BIOSCI ENG","Math.

In the first stage, six time series are jointly decomposed into 10 independent intrinsic mode functions (IMF) from high to low frequency plus one residual. In the second stage, the IMFs for each cryptocurrency are composed into three components based on Wilcoxon signed-rank test, including high and low frequency components and a long-term trend. These three multi-scale components can be interpreted as short-term fluctuations caused by investor sentiment and micro-structure, the effect of significant events and fundamental values. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the low and high frequency compositions are determining factors of cryptocurrency prices, which supports for the existing evidence (e.g. Bouoiyour, Selmi, Tiwari, & Olayeni, 2016; Ji, Bouri, Lau, & Roubaud, 2019).","[Yang, Boyu; Sun, Yuying; Wang, Shouyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Yang, Boyu; Wang, Shouyang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yuying; Wang, Shouyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Forecasting Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Sun, YY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.","sunyuying@amss.ac.cn","sun, yuying/AAF-6786-2021","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71703156, 71988101,72073126]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was partially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71703156, 71988101,72073126).

In contrast to fiat currencies, transactions of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin, are permanently recorded on distributed ledgers to be seen by the public. As a result, public availability of all cryptocurrency transactions allows us to create a complex network of financial interactions that can be used to study not only the blockchain graph, but also the relationship between various blockchain network features and cryptocurrency risk investment. We introduce a novel concept of chainlets, or blockchain motifs, to utilize this information. Chainlets allow us to evaluate the role of local topological structure of the blockchain on the joint Bitcoin and Litecoin price formation and dynamics. We investigate the predictive Granger causality of chainlets and identify certain types of chainlets that exhibit the highest predictive influence on cryptocurrency price and investment risk. More generally, while statistical aspects of blockchain data analytics remain virtually unexplored, the paper aims to highlight various emerging theoretical, methodological and applied research challenges of blockchain data analysis that will be of interest to the broad statistical community.

As of May 2020, the storage size of the Bitcoin blockchain has expanded to 270 GB, and it will continue to increase. This storage requirement is a major hurdle to becoming a block proposer or validator. Although many studies have attempted to reduce the storage size, in the proposed methods, a node cannot keep all blocks or cannot generate a block. We propose an architecture called Trail that allows nodes to hold all blocks in a small storage and to generate and validate blocks and transactions. Trail does not depend on a consensus algorithm or fork choice rule. In this architecture, a client who issues transactions has the data to prove its own balances and can generate a transaction containing the proof of balances. The nodes in Trail do not store transactions, UTXOs and account balances: they keep only blocks. The blocksize is approximately 8 KB, which is 100 times smaller than that of Bitcoin. Further, the block size is constant regardless of the number of accounts and the number of transactions. Compared to traditional blockchains, clients who issue transactions must store additional data. However, we show that proper data archiving can keep the account device storage size small. Trail allows more users to be block proposers and validators and improves the decentralization of the blockchain.","[Nagayama, Ryunosuke; Banno, Ryohei; Shudo, Kazuyuki] Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan","Tokyo Institute of Technology","Nagayama, R (corresponding author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan.","nagayama.r.ac@m.titech.ac.jp","Banno, Ryohei/AAB-9445-2019","Banno, Ryohei/0000-0001-7268-4657","SECOM Science and Technology Foundation","SECOM Science and Technology Foundation","This work was supported by SECOM Science and Technology Foundation.","","8","3","3","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1530-1346","","978-1-7281-8086-1","IEEE SYMP COMP COMMU","","","2020","","","","","","","511","517","","","","","","7","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BR4RM","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000652570900081","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The novel Threshold Weighted-Minimum Dominating Set (TW-MDS) methodology is employed in order to identify the so-called dominant cryptocurrencies for each year. In this framework, a node is identified as dominant when it can adequately describe the collective behavior of its relevant neighborhood. The empirical results provide strong evidence of an increased price synchronization. One interesting finding is that, contrary to what may be expected, the cryptocurrencies that are identified as dominant are not always the most popular that are usually the ones with the highest capitalization (such as Bitcoin or Ethereum).

Its applications are far beyond the financial sector. The transaction verification process for cryptocurrencies is much slower than traditional digital transaction systems. One approach to scalability or the speed at which transactions are processed is to design a solution that offers faster Proof of Work. In this paper, we propose a method for accelerating the process of Proof of Work based on parallel mining rather than solo mining. The goal is to ensure that no more than two or more miners put the same effort into solving a specific block. The proposed method includes a process for selection of a manager, distribution of work and a reward system. This method has been implemented in a test environment that contains all the characteristics needed to perform Proof of Work for Bitcoin and has been tested, using a variety of case scenarios, by varying the difficulty level and number of validators. Experimental evaluations were performed locally and in a cloud environment, and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility the proposed method.","[Shahriar Hazari, Shihab; Mahmoud, Qusay H.] Ontario Tech Univ, Dept Elect Comp & Software Engn, Oshawa, ON L1G 0C5, Canada","","Hazari, SS (corresponding author), Ontario Tech Univ, Dept Elect Comp & Software Engn, Oshawa, ON L1G 0C5, Canada.","shihab.hazari@ontariotechu.net; qusay.mahmoud@uoit.ca","","H.

In this paper, a uniform payment system is designed with the following advantages. (1). By limiting the token-minting right to a designated token-minting bank and the design of label, our system prevents the counterfeit token problem. (2). A complete transaction is divided into Bitcoin-level part and Fabric-level part. The Bitcoin-level part constructs inputs and outputs and signs these inputs, outputs and a nonce with a private key. This makes a micro enterprises or an end consumer can enjoy the payment service as the Bitcoin-level operation can be implemented on a mobile phone. The double-spending problem is prevented by the Fabric-level mechanism. (3). The system is easy to expand. When there is a new payment application, only one sub-function is added to the payment contract to implement the payment application, and a call to the sub-function is added. (4). Compared with Bitcoin, the unlockcode of UTXO only needs to be stored once, instead of being stored with each UTXO, thus reducing the sizes of transactions.

Findings The results evidence the existence of psychological barriers in four of the cryptocurrencies under scrutiny, namely, Bitcoin, Dash, NEM and Ripple. Practical implications The fact that the cryptocurrency market has a high share of unexperienced investors and presents several cases of psychological barriers is consistent with the hypothesis that that class of investors is particularly prone to the behavioral biases which cause psychological barriers.

Using a novel two-step time and frequency independent methodology, the authors examine a large scope of cryptocurrencies and external factors within the same period, and analytical framework. Design/methodology/approach The examined cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Monero and Dash. In total, 18 external factors from 5 factor families are selected based on the mining motivation of these cryptocurrencies. The study first examines discrete wavelet transform-based (WTB) correlations, reduce the dimension and focuson relevant pairs. Selected pairs are further examined by wavelet coherence to capture the intermittent nature of the relationships allowing the most needed Flexibility of frequency and time domains. Findings Each coin appears to operate as a unique character with the exception of Bitcoin and Litecoin. There is no prominent external driver. The cryptocurrency market is not a clear substitute for a specific factor or market. Two-step WTB filtered wavelet coherence analysis help us to analyze a large number of factor without the loss of focus. The co-movements within the cryptocurrencies spillover from Ethereum to altcoins and later to Bitcoin. Originality/value The study presents one of the first examples of two-step WTB filtered wavelet coherence analysis. The methodology suggests an approach for simultaneous examination of large number of variables. The scope of the study provides a rather holistic view of the co-movements of external factors and major cryptocurrencies.","[Erzurumlu, Yaman Omer] Bahcesehir Univ, Dept Engn Management, Istanbul, Turkey; [Oygur, Tunc; Kirik, Alper] Yeditepe Univ, Inst Social Sci, Istanbul, Turkey","Bahcesehir University; Yeditepe University","Erzurumlu, YO (corresponding author), Bahcesehir Univ, Dept Engn Management, Istanbul, Turkey.","yerzurumlu@gmail.com; info@tuncoygur.com.tr; alper.kirik@gmail.com","ERZURUMLU, Yaman/AAM-1047-2021","ERZURUMLU, Yaman/0000-0002-8969-7232; Kirik, Alper/0000-0002-3481-2205; Oygur, Tunc/0000-0003-1877-4840","","","","","54","2","2","1","7","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1086-7376","1755-6791","","STUD ECON FINANC","Stud.

Moreover, to verify whether the importance of jumps for RV forecasting changes over time, we extend the standard MIDAS model to characterize two volatility regimes and introduce a jump-driven time-varying transition probability between the two regimes. Our results suggest that the proposed novel MRS-MIDAS model exhibits statistically significant improvement for forecasting the RV of Bitcoin. In addition, we find that jump occurrences significantly increase the persistence of the high-volatility regime and switch between high- and low-volatility regimes. A wide range of checks confirm the robustness of our results. Finally, the proposed model shows significant improvement for 2-week and 1-month horizon forecasts.","[Ma, Feng; Liang, Chao] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yuanhui] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Math, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Wahab, M.

The core Bitcoin technology is the so-called blockchain protocol. In recent years, several studies have focused on rigorous analyses of the security of Nakamoto's blockchain protocol in an asynchronous network where network delay must be considered. Wei, Yuan, and Zheng investigated the effect of a long delay attack against Nakamoto's blockchain protocol. However, their proof only holds in the honest miner setting. In this study, we improve Wei, Yuan and Zheng's result using a stronger model where the adversary can perform long delay attacks and corrupt a certain fraction of the miners. We propose a method to analyze the converge event and demonstrate that the properties of chain growth, common prefix, and chain quality still hold with reasonable parameters in our stronger model.","[Yuan, Quan; Wei, Puwen] Shandong Univ, Key Lab Cryptol Technol & Informat Secur, Minist Educ, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China; [Jia, Keting] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Xue, Haiyang] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Informat Secur, Inst Informat Engn, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China; [Xue, Haiyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Data Assurance & Commun Secur Res Ctr, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China","Shandong University; Tsinghua University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Engineering, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Wei, PW (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Key Lab Cryptol Technol & Informat Secur, Minist Educ, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China.","pwei@sdu.edu.cn","Yuan, Quan/AGA-6633-2022","Yuan, Quan/0000-0001-8367-389X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61602473]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0303903]; National Cryptography Development Fund [MMJJ20170116]; Zhejiang Province Key RD Project [2017C01062]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Cryptography Development Fund; Zhejiang Province Key RD Project","Quan YUAN and Puwen WEI were supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61502276).

We analyze return and volatility (proxied by absolute and squared returns) series of Bitcoin and the following crypto assets: Bitcoin Cash, DASH, Ethereum, IOTA, Litecoin, NEO, XRP. In the analysis, we consider the BTC markets of those 7 altcoins as well as the USD markets. Empirical findings indicate existence of statistically significant structural changes in terms of returns and volatility. Return and volatility series share different dynamics. On the other hand, time series quoted in BTC perform different structural change behavior than the ones quoted in USD. We also observed a clustering of breakpoints in the periods of February-March 2017 and December 2017-March 2018. For the logarithmic returns, in the mean of BTCUSD and series quoted in BTC no structural breaks are available. The mean of logarithmic returns of DASH, ETH and LTC quoted in USD have structural changes corresponding to the beginning of the downtrend in USD price series of the relevant assets. Absolute returns revealed more of structural breaks in terms of volatility than squared returns. Except for IOTA, volatility last longer in the series quoted in USD than the ones quoted in BTC. For the volatility series of ETH, LTC and NEO, regimes in the time series quoted in BTC is affected by the trend change in the USD quoted price series of the asset. We have defined this regime change and trend change relationship as trend awareness-based interaction. We also found a specific trend change pattern in the time series. In comparison to the time series of altcoins, BTCUSD is the first one which has the trend change almost in all cases. Besides, the time series of BCH, ETH, LTC and NEO (and DASH partly) follows a specific trend change order as the following: first in USD quoted time series of the altcoin and then in BTC quoted ones, while the time series of IOTA and XRP indicate the opposite.

Bitcoin was introduced as the first cryptocurrency to allow direct online payments without relying on centralized financial entities. The use of Bitcoin has vastly grown as a financial asset rather than just a tool for online payments. A lot of cryptocurrencies have been created since 2011 with Bitcoin dominating the cryptocurrencies' market. With plenty of cryptocurrencies being used as financial assets and with millions of trades being executed through different exchange services, cryptocurrencies are susceptible to trading problems and challenges similar to those traditionally encountered in the financial domain. Price and trend prediction, volatility prediction, portfolio construction and fraud detection are some examples related to trading. In addition, there are other challenges that are specific to the domain of cryptocurrencies such as mining, cybersecurity, anonymity and privacy. In this paper, we survey the application of artificial intelligence techniques to address these challenges for cryptocurrencies with their vast amount of daily transactions, trades and news that are beyond human capabilities to analyze and learn from. This paper discusses the recent research work done in this emerging area and compares them in terms of used techniques and datasets. It also highlights possible research gaps and some potential areas for improvement.","[Sabry, Farida; Labda, Wadha; Malluhi, Qutaibah] Qatar Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Doha, Qatar; [Erbad, Aiman] Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Div Informat & Comp Technol, Coll Sci & Engn, Doha, Qatar","Qatar University; Qatar Foundation (QF); Hamad Bin Khalifa University-Qatar","Sabry, F (corresponding author), Qatar Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Doha, Qatar.","faridasabry@ieee.org","Sabry, Farida/AAE-4607-2020; Erbad, Aiman/ABH-8517-2020","Sabry, Farida/0000-0001-5639-983X; Erbad, Aiman/0000-0001-7565-5253","Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF) [NPRP X-063-1-014]; Qatar National Library (QNL)","Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)(National Research Foundation of KoreaQatar National Research Fund (QNRF)); Qatar National Library (QNL)(Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF))","The research in this article was done for project number NPRP X-063-1-014 under a grant from Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF).

Bitcoin is the first and the most popular cryptocurrency. One of the ways to obtain Bitcoins is coin mining. Bitcoin mining is a mechanism, in which miner expend resources in a computation process to synchronize Bitcoin transactions for collecting Bitcoins as rewards. Currently, there are a number of crypto-mining marketplaces, in which allows selling or buying computing power on demand. In this paper, we focus on NiceHash platform, which is the largest crypto-mining marketplace having a large number of active miners. In NiceHash platform, sellers (also called, miners) mine coins to fulfill the selected buyers' orders. NiceHash offers a software which can automatically select the most profitable algorithm for miners, so miners do not need to monitor the market and their multiple wallets. However, the existing software usually select an algorithm for a miner to mine without any further update for a long time even the profit gained by using a mining algorithm is highly fluctuated. Moreover, many miners experienced lots of disconnects on the NiceHash pool. To address the above problems, we proposed a system which can maximize the Bitcoin profit of miners by automatically selecting the most profitable mining algorithms and keeping track on the connection between miners and the mining pool. Experiences show that our automated system can effectively maximize the mining profits by increasing 21% when compared with the original algorithm used in NiceHash.","[Yuen, Man-Ching] Hong Kong Shue Yan Univ, Ctr Appl Data Sci, Dept Journalism & Commun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lau, Ka-Ming] Hong Kong Inst Vocat Educ, Dept Informat Technol, Tsing Yi, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ng, Ka-Fai] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Hong Kong Shue Yan University; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology","Yuen, MC (corresponding author), Hong Kong Shue Yan Univ, Ctr Appl Data Sci, Dept Journalism & Commun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","mcyuen@hksyu.edu","YUEN, Man Ching/AAM-7790-2021","YUEN, Man Ching/0000-0003-2551-7746; Ka Fai, NG/0000-0001-9837-9175","","","","","6","2","2","1","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2155-2487","","978-1-7281-3187-0","INT CONF COMMUN SYST","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BP4XF","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000554883200004","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This field of science is developing day by day. Blockchain has come a long way since the birth of its first application. This application is Bitcoin which depends on Blockchain or DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology). Bitcoin is the most famous cryptocurrency intended for mass which appeared the first time in 2008. This innovation led to sparked in the digital revolution, which provides for many sectors and industries the security features, decentralization, and a reliable mechanism for transmission and storing data. This new technology led to the meteoric rise of Bitcoin and other such cryptocurrencies, so this has aroused the interest of governments and emerging companies to get an effective role in competition. We can apply blockchain in different sectors and different Internet of things (IoT). Cryptocurrency mining has become a major concern for computer professionals and also for those who earn more money from an additional source. Mining is a process for settle mathematical issues that depend on the strength and speed of the devices to solve those problems, which by resolving them leads to getting rewards in the form of a digital currency. In this paper, we will highlight the benefits of using both CPU (Central Processing Unit) and GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) and a practical comparison between them to find out the best and fastest based on previous studies and on the characteristics and architecture of each.","[Alkaeed, Mahdi Kh; Al-Ali, Muhammed Samir; Al-Mohammed, Hasan Abbas] Qatar Univ, Doha, Qatar; [Alamro, Zaid] Albalqa Appl Univ, Doha, Qatar; [Khan, Khaled M.] Qatar Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Comp Sci, Doha, Qatar","Qatar University; Qatar University","Alkaeed, MK (corresponding author), Qatar Univ, Doha, Qatar.","ma1805365@qu.edu.qa; zh0799017963@gmail.com; ma0903261@qu.edu.qa; ha1800217@qu.edu.qa; k.khan@qu.edu.qa","Al-Mohammed, Hasan/AAX-4905-2021","","Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF) [NPRP8-531-1-111]","Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)(National Research Foundation of KoreaQatar National Research Fund (QNRF))","This paper was made possible by Grant NPRP8-531-1-111 from Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF) The statements made herein are solely the responsibility of the authors.","","11","3","3","0","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2470-640X","","978-1-7281-9910-8","INT CONF SYST ENG","","","2020","","","","","","","67","72","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BR2BQ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000637042200013","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Block chain has the characteristics of decentralization, anonymity and non-tampering, which realizes the transformation from social trust to machine trust. As an important part of block chain system, digital signature is relatively inefficient. For this reason, this paper proposes an aggregation signature scheme based on FPGA, which combines the aggregation signature technology with the reconfiguration of FPGA, realizes the aggregation of multiple user signatures into one signature, and has multiple ECC acceleration modules in FPGA. The efficiency of digital signature calculation is improved. Through experimental analysis and comparison, the scheme uses FPGA reconstruction and aggregate signature technology, which not only improves the computational efficiency of ECC, but also improves the efficiency of signature verification and improves the performance of block chain system.","[Fu, Jinhua; Huang, Yongzhong; Si, Xueming; Wang, Yongjuan; Li, Bin] State Key Lab Math Engn & Adv Comp, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Fu, Jinhua; Liu, Jiaheng] Zhengzhou Univ Light Ind, Sch Comp & Commun Engn, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China; [Huang, Yongzhong] Guilin Univ Elect Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Informat Secur, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China; [Si, Xueming] Fudan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China","PLA Information Engineering University; Zhengzhou University of Light Industry; Guilin University of Electronic Technology; Fudan University","Wang, YJ (corresponding author), State Key Lab Math Engn & Adv Comp, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China.","pinkywyj@163.com","","","","","","","7","0","0","1","4","SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD","SINGAPORE","152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE","1865-0929","1865-0937","978-981-15-2777-7; 978-981-15-2776-0","COMM COM INF SC","","","2020","1156","","","","","","92","100","","10.1007/978-981-15-2777-7_8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-2777-7_8","","","9","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR5RE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000656861800008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The parameter optimization of the LS-SVM model was performed using hybridization of Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) with Differential Evolution (DE), called optimal GWO (OGWO) algorithm. The hybridization process is performed to eliminate the local optima problem of GWO and enhance the diversity of the population. To verify the goodness of the proposed model, the Ethereum (ETH) return rate was chosen as the target and experimental analysis was performed on it to verify the predictive results on the time series. The experimental outcome was analyzed in terms of two performance measures namely Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

We thus propose the novel secure testament methodology for a digital asset such as Bitcoin to solve the mentioned problems. The mechanism is based on managing the mnemonic seed of the wallet so that an inheritor will obtain the mnemonic seed in a secure way. Two mechanisms of the proposed methodology are implemented. The first is to save the mnemonic seed in a secure repository. Therefore, no one can access to the cryptocurrency wallet while the owner still being alive and does not wish anybody to access. The second is to deliver the mnemonic seed securely to legitimate inheritor when the owner is suspected to be dead or disappeared. Finally, based on our experiment, the results show that the aforementioned problems can be solved. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism can help the owner of the asset to managing the confidentiality of their assets.","[Janpitak, Nanta] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Engn Sriracha, Sri Racha Campus,199 Moo 6,Sukhumvit Rd, Sri Racha 20230, Chonburi, Thailand; [Lilakiatsakun, Woraphon] Mahanakorn Univ Technol, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, Bangkok, Thailand; [Sathitwiriyawong, Chanboon] King Mongkuts Inst Technol, Fac Informat Technol, Bangkok, Thailand","Mahanakorn University of Technology; King Mongkuts University of Technology North Bangkok","Janpitak, N (corresponding author), Kasetsart Univ, Fac Engn Sriracha, Sri Racha Campus,199 Moo 6,Sukhumvit Rd, Sri Racha 20230, Chonburi, Thailand.","njanpita@hotmail.com","","Janpitak, Nanta/0000-0002-8034-8159","","","","","21","0","1","0","2","TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC","PHILADELPHIA","530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA","1939-3555","1939-3547","","INF SECUR J","Inf.

It utilizes blockchain technology, which ensures data is immutable, transparent and reliable. Cryptocurrency is present in different forms like Blockchain and is present in most parts of the world. Developed nations have a significant interest in technology and have put a measure to investigate while developing nations are also following suit. The global interest in cryptocurrency is associated with the fact that the movement of money will be traceable and it will minimize activities such as money laundering and corruption. The paper analyzes a selected period of six years to establish the efficiency of the Blockchain in the markets. A graph and tables are essential in generating more data for interpretation of the events. The tests used in the analysis are the Ljung-box, R/S Hurst, BDS, Runs, AVR test, and Bartels tests. All the tests demonstrated inefficiencies in the Bitcoin trend, especially in the full sample and slightly low inefficiency in the later subsample. The conclusion made is that bitcoin will improve its efficiency over time as it is an emerging industry that needs to grow. Developing countries experience higher inefficiency combined with the prevalent policy challenges and issues like corruption and unemployment.","[Pathiranage, Heshan Sameera Kankanam; Xiao, Huilin] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Liutai Ave, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Li, Weifeng] Tsinghua Univ, PBC Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Weifeng] Tsinghua Univ, Res Ctr Ind Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China","Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University","Pathiranage, HSK (corresponding author), Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Liutai Ave, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.","heshan.sameera@gmail.com","Kankanam Pathiranage, Heshan Sameera/I-4400-2017","Kankanam Pathiranage, Heshan Sameera/0000-0002-1727-6092","","","","","12","1","1","3","14","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1350-4851","1466-4291","","APPL ECON LETT","Appl.

In this regard, it is expected that information level and sharing between equity, digital currency, and energy markets has been altered due to the pandemic outbreak. Specifically, the resulting twisted risk among markets is presumed to rise during the abnormal state of world economy. The purpose of the current study is twofold. First, by using Renyi entropy, we analyze the multiscale entropy function in the return time series of Bitcoin, S&P500, WTI, Brent, Gas, Gold, Silver, and investor fear index represented by VIX. Second, by estimating mutual information, we analyze the information sharing between these markets. The analyses are conducted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The empirical results from Renyi entropy indicate that for all market indices, randomness and disorder are more concentrated in less probable events. The empirical results from mutual information showed that the information sharing network between markets has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. From a managerial perspective, we conclude that during the pandemic (i) portfolios composed of Bitcoin and Silver, Bitcoin and WTI, Bitcoin and Gold, Bitcoin and Brent, or Bitcoin and S&P500 could be risky, (ii) diversification opportunities exist by investing in portfolios composed of Gas and Silver, Gold and Silver, Gold and Gas, Brent and Silver, Brent and Gold, or Bitcoin and Gas, and that (iii) the VIX exhibited the lowest level of information disorder at all scales before and during the pandemic. Thus, it seems that the pandemic has not influenced the expectations of investors. Our results provide an insight of the response of stocks, cryptocurrencies, energy, precious metal markets, to expectations of investors in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of information ordering and sharing.

In this paper, we propose an approach to parse and visualize the data of Bitcoin blockchain in a graph structure and carry out analysis that includes tracking and tracing, address clustering and entity tagging. We also try to find patterns in the data at a macro level to provide insights about the overall system.

One popular usage of Blockchain is adistributed replicated database. In this paper, we present initial studies on the challenges and opportunities of using Blockchain as a database for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. For IoT applications, latency is an important factor, whereas for application developers,consistencyis an important property which specifies how the system orders the operations over blocks (that are stored in the Blockchain). However, consistency property of Blockchain-based database is not well studied, especially in the case when network isnotsynchronized and the system isdynamic-both are typical scenario in an IoT environment. Intuitively, Blockchain is designed to maintain a single ground truth-one can view the Blockchain itself as the order of the blocks that all participants should observe and respect. In most Blockchain designs, the participants will eventually converge to the same chain of blocks. However, there is very few study on the challenges of using Blockchains as a database in an IoT environment. This paper focuses on the enabling technology behind Bitcoin, Bitcoin Backbone Protocol (BBP). We first survey Blockchain-based IoT applications, and identify why it is necessary to use it as a database for IoT applications. Then we explore several reasonable consistency models for BBP-based database, and then show that such a database does not satisfy many consistency models under certain typical IoT environments. Moreover, we use simulation to study how network quality and system dynamic affect consistency. Finally, we propose a simple mechanism to make the BBP-based database satisfy both read-my-write and eventual consistency.","[Tseng, Lewis; Yao, Xinyu] Boston Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Boston, MA USA; [Otoum, Safa] Zayed Univ, Coll Technol Innovat, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Aloqaily, Moayad] Al Ain Univ, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Jararweh, Yaser] Jordan Univ Sci & Technol, Irbid, Jordan","Boston College; Zayed University; Jordan University of Science & Technology","Otoum, S (corresponding author), Zayed Univ, Coll Technol Innovat, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.","Lewis.Tseng@bc.edu; Yaoxe@bc.edu; Safa.Otoum@zu.ac.ae; maloqaily@ieee.org; yijararweh@just.edu.jo","Aloqaily, Moayad/AAJ-2598-2020; Aloqaily, Moayad/AAV-9016-2021; Otoum, Safa/AAA-5216-2021; Jararweh, Yaser/ABE-6543-2021","Aloqaily, Moayad/0000-0003-2443-7234; Otoum, Safa/0000-0002-0814-7328; ","","","","","36","53","53","4","26","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1386-7857","1573-7543","","CLUSTER COMPUT","Cluster Comput.","SEP","2020","23","3","","","","","2151","2165","","10.1007/s10586-020-03138-7","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10586-020-03138-7","","JUL 2020","15","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science","PQ3CG","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000546863500001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Such a system faces various cryptoeconomic attacks, such as selfish mining. Previous studies have shown that with over 25% of the overall mining power, a selfish miner can benefit by gaining a proportion of rewards higher than its mining power in Bitcoin. This threshold is still higher than any current mining pool, and hence, selfish mining is not considered likely in Bitcoin. Unfortunately, this threshold is only applicable for a single attacker scenario, whereas in a realistic setting, multiple mining pools with significant hash power could perform selfish mining simultaneously. In this paper, we address this research gap by analyzing selfish mining scenarios with multiple independent attackers. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that when the number of selfish miners increases, each of them requires less mining power to gain an advantage, but that the range of mining power such that each selfish miner benefits becomes narrower and thus less sustainable. Our work is the first to show that in practice, there are scenarios where it is enough to have 12% mining power to benefit from selfish mining but also that having more than 7 selfish miners which benefit simultaneously is highly unlikely. We also infer that it is always beneficial for selfish miners to collude and build a more powerful mining pool than to mine independently. Additionally, we propose a safe limit for the size of mining pools in Bitcoin to avoid multi-player attacks. Finally, we extend our studies to Ethereum which uses a different reward model based on uncle blocks.","[Zhang, Shiquan; Kemme, Bettina] McGill Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Zhang, Kaiwen] Univ Quebec, Ecole Technol Super, Dept Genie Logiciel & TI, Montreal, PQ, Canada","McGill University; University of Quebec; Ecole de Technologie Superieure - Canada; University of Quebec Montreal","Zhang, SQ (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada.","shiquan.zhang@mail.mcgill.ca; kaiwen.zhang@etsmtl.ca; kemme@cs.mcgill.ca","","","","","","","19","2","2","1","2","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-0-7381-0495-9","","","","2020","","","","","","","36","44","","10.1109/Blockchain50366.2020.00013","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain50366.2020.00013","","","9","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR3LS","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000647642100005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Specifically, we use two econometric models to perform a two-layer analysis to study the correlation and prediction of Bitcoin and Ether price series with traditional assets. In the first part of this study, we model the probability of positive returns via a Bayesian logistic model. Even though the fitting performance of the logistic model is poor, we find that traditional assets can explain some of the variability of the price returns. Along with the fact that standard models fail to capture the statistic and econometric attributes-such as extreme variability and heteroskedasticity-of cryptocurrencies, this motivates us to apply a novel Non-Homogeneous Hidden Markov model to these series. In particular, we model Bitcoin and Ether prices via the non-homogeneous Polya-Gamma Hidden Markov (NHPG) model, since it has been shown that it outperforms its counterparts in conventional financial data. The transition probabilities of the underlying hidden process are modeled via a logistic link whereas the observed series follow a mixture of normal regressions conditionally on the hidden process. Our results show that the NHPG algorithm has good in-sample performance and captures the heteroskedasticity of both series. It identifies frequent changes between the two states of the underlying Markov process. In what constitutes the most important implication of our study, we show that there exist linear correlations between the covariates and the ETH and BTC series. However, only the ETH series are affected non-linearly by a subset of the accounted covariates. Finally, we conclude that the large number of significant predictors along with the weak degree of predictability performance of the algorithm back up earlier findings that cryptocurrencies are unlike any other financial assets and predicting the cryptocurrency price series is still a challenging task. These findings can be useful to investors, policy makers, traders for portfolio allocation, risk management and trading strategies.","[Koki, Constandina] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Dept Stat, Athens 10434, Greece; [Leonardos, Stefanos; Piliouras, Georgios] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Engn Syst & Design, Singapore 487372, Singapore","Athens University of Economics & Business; Singapore University of Technology & Design","Koki, C (corresponding author), Athens Univ Econ & Business, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Dept Stat, Athens 10434, Greece.","kokiconst@aueb.gr; stefanos_leonardos@sutd.edu.sg; georgios@sutd.edu.sg","Koki, Constandina/AAA-7137-2021","Koki, Constandina/0000-0002-3236-8876; Leonardos, Stefanos/0000-0002-1498-1490; Piliouras, Georgios/0000-0002-6236-3566","MOE AcRF Tier 2 Grant [2016-T2-1-170]; National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, under its National Cybersecurity RD Program [NRF2016NCR-NCR002-028]; SUTD grant [SRG ESD 2015 097]; NRF [NRF-NRFF2018-07]","MOE AcRF Tier 2 Grant; National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, under its National Cybersecurity RD Program; SUTD grant(Singapore University of Technology & Design); NRF","Stefanos Leonardos and Georgios Piliouras were supported by MOE AcRF Tier 2 Grant 2016-T2-1-170 and in part by the National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, under its National Cybersecurity R&D Program (Award No. NRF2016NCR-NCR002-028) and administered by the National Cybersecurity R&D Directorate.

In the classical period, jurists differed on the reason behind Islam's prohibition of usury when dealing with precious metals and their derivatives, with the majority arguing that this is because they are considered to hold value (thamaniyya). The cause (?illa) of holding value can therefore be applied through analogy (qiyas) to all things understood by the laity to hold value in any era. In the contemporary period, this cause can also be applied to virtual currencies such as Bitcoin if they fulfill the following ethical conditions: customary acceptance, legal validity, and value stability.","[Baker, Man] Zayed Univ, Coll Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Islamic World Studies, Abu Dhabi 144534, U Arab Emirates; [Semai, Muhammed] Univ Sharjah, Dept Jurisprudence & Fdn, Coll Sharia & Islamic Studies, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates","Zayed University; University of Sharjah","Baker, M (corresponding author), Zayed Univ, Coll Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Islamic World Studies, Abu Dhabi 144534, U Arab Emirates.","man.baker@zu.ac.ae; msemai@sharjah.ac.ae","","Baker, Man/0000-0002-4880-6666","","","","","25","0","0","1","1","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2077-1444","","RELIGIONS","Religions","JUL","2020","11","7","","","","","","","339","10.3390/rel11070339","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rel11070339","","","11","Religion","Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI)","Religion","MW5KP","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000557075800001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We develop a framework that discovers potential causes of phasic shifts in the price movement captured by social media discussions. This draws on principles developed in healthcare epidemiology where, similarly, only observational data are available. Such causes may have a major, one-off effect, or recurring effects on the trend in the price series. We find a one-off effect of regulatory bans on bitcoin, the repeated effects of rival innovations on ether and the influence of technical traders, captured through discussion of market price, on both cryptocurrencies. The results for Bitcoin differ from Ethereum, which is consistent with the observed differences in the timing of the highest price and the price phases. This framework could be applied to a wide range of cryptocurrency price series where there exists a relevant social media text source. Identified causes with a recurring effect may have value in predictive modelling, whilst one-off causes may provide insight into unpredictable black swan events that can have a major impact on a system.","[Burnie, Andrew; Yilmaz, Emine; Aste, Tomaso] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London, England; [Burnie, Andrew; Yilmaz, Emine] Alan Turing Inst, British Lib, London, England","University of London; University College London","Burnie, A (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London, England.;Burnie, A (corresponding author), Alan Turing Inst, British Lib, London, England.","aburnie@turing.ac.uk","","Burnie, Andrew/0000-0002-8700-3786","Alan Turing Institute under the EPSRC [EP/N510129/1]; EPSRC [EP/P024289/1]; BARAC project [EP/P031730/1]; FinTech project [H2020-ICT-20182 825215]; Turing award [TU/C/000028]; EPSRC [EP/N510129/1, EP/P031730/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Alan Turing Institute under the EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); BARAC project; FinTech project; Turing award; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This work was supported by The Alan Turing Institute under the EPSRC grant EP/N510129/1 and Turing award number TU/C/000028.

Satoshi Nakamoto has come up with a genius idea to create a system that is a digital abstraction book of the balance and make that system public for all practical transactions related to accounts and transactions, which, when simplified, are reduced to mere addition and subtraction operations. He used the digital media feature to make perfect own copies, so he distributed this copy of the balance book to every computer in the network (decentralized system) and obtained a unique (structurally unchangeable) and global (public) book of balance. Thus, a revolutionary blockchain technology was created, which initially enabled and supported the functioning of the first digital crypto currency bitcoin. Blockchain technology is an amalgam of several different and equally revolutionary technological achievements in the field of cryptography and computer networks. The aim of this paper is, using Bitcoin as example, to briefly explain the functioning of this technology and its suitability for use in many other areas of human activity, especially those that have a problem of distrust and the possibility of fraud.","[Stupar, Savo; Car, Mirha Bico; Sahic, Elvir] Univ Sarajevo, Sch Econ & Business, Trg Oslobodenja 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg","University of Sarajevo","Stupar, S (corresponding author), Univ Sarajevo, Sch Econ & Business, Trg Oslobodenja 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg.","savo.stupar@efsa.unsa.ba; mirha.car@efsa.unsa.ba","Šahić, Elvir/GLT-0746-2022; Bico Car, Mirha/GMX-4461-2022; Stupar, Savo/AAS-5419-2020","Šahić, Elvir/0000-0002-9318-0009; Bico Car, Mirha/0000-0002-9810-3512; ","","","","","19","0","0","1","40","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","2367-3370","2367-3389","978-3-030-18072-0; 978-3-030-18071-3","LECT NOTE NETW SYST","","","2020","76","","","","","","355","364","","10.1007/978-3-030-18072-0_41","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-18072-0_41","","","10","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BO1AQ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000494447600041","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, in recent years, a shift from decentrality to centrality has been observed in the most accepted Blockchain system, i.e., Bitcoin. This shift has motivated researchers to identify the cause of decentrality, quantify decentrality and analyze the impact of decentrality. In this work, we take a holistic approach to identify and quantify decentrality in Blockchain based systems. First, we identify the emergence of centrality in three layers of Blockchain based systems, namely governance layer, network layer and storage layer. Then, we quantify decentrality in these layers using various metrics. At the governance layer, we measure decentrality in terms of fairness, entropy, Gini coefficient, Kullback-Leibler divergence, etc. Similarly, in the network layer, we measure decentrality by using degree centrality, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality. At the storage layer, we apply a distribution index to define centrality. Subsequently, we evaluate the decentrality in Bitcoin and Ethereum networks and discuss our observations. We noticed that, with time, both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks tend to behave like centralized systems where a few nodes govern the whole network.","[Gochhayat, Sarada Prasad; Shetty, Sachin; Foytik, Peter; Kamhoua, Georges A.] Old Dominion Univ, Virginia Modeling Anal & Simulat Ctr, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Mukkamala, Ravi] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Njilla, Laurent] Air Force Res Lab, Cyber Assurance Branch, Rome, NY 13441 USA","Old Dominion University; Old Dominion University; United States Department of Defense; United States Air Force; US Air Force Research Laboratory","Gochhayat, SP (corresponding author), Old Dominion Univ, Virginia Modeling Anal & Simulat Ctr, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.","sgochhay@odu.edu","Shetty, Sachin/W-1101-2018","Shetty, Sachin/0000-0002-8789-0610; GOCHHAYAT, SARADA PRASAD/0000-0003-0412-7722","","","","","70","5","5","7","18","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","178372","178390","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3026577","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3026577","","","19","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","OA6HY","","Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000577884900001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This study measures the relation between technology readiness dimension (optimism, innovativeness, discomfort, insecurity) and the technology acceptance (perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness) - and the intention to use cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin. The contribution of this study include the use of a multi-analytical approach by combining Partial Least Squares- Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) analysis. First, PLS-SEM was applied to assess which factor has significant influence toward intention to use cryptocurrency. Second, an ANN was employed to rank the relative influence of the significant predictor variables attained from the PLS-SEM. The findings of the two-step PLS-SEM and ANN approach confirm that the use of ANN further verifies the results obtained by the PLS-SEM analysis. Also, ANN is capable of modelling complex linear and non-linear relationships with high predictive accuracy compared to SEM methods.

A noteworthy example are the bitcoin wallets. Designed the most secure piece of software, their security can be compromised by a simple piece of malware infecting the device storing keys used for signing transactions. Secure hardware devices such as Trusted Platform Module (TPM) offers the ability to create a piece of code that can run unmolested by the rest of software applications hosted in the same machine. This has turned out to be a valuable approach for preventing several malware threats. Unfortunately, their restricted functionalities make them inconsistent with the use of multi and threshold signature mechanisms which are in the heart of real world cryptocurrency wallets implementation. This paper proposes an efficient multi-signature scheme that fits the requirement of the TPM. Based on discrete logarithm and pairings, our scheme does not require any interaction between signers and provide the same benefits as the well established BLS signature scheme. Furthermore, we proposed a formal model of our design and proved it security in a semi-honest model. Finally, we implemented a prototype of our design and studied its performance. From our experimental analysis, the proposed design is highly efficient and can serve as a groundwork for using TPM in future cryptocurrency wallets.","[Hedabou, Mustapha; Abdulsalam, Yunusa Simpa] Univ Mohammed VI Polytech, Sch Comp & Commun Sci, Benguerir 43512, Morocco","Mohammed VI Polytechnic University","Hedabou, M (corresponding author), Univ Mohammed VI Polytech, Sch Comp & Commun Sci, Benguerir 43512, Morocco.","mustapha.hedabou@um6p.ma; abdulsalam.yunusa@um6p.ma","","","","","","","25","3","3","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-8800-3","","","","2020","","","","","","","110","115","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR4JO","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000651584500021","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The data set includes equity (Bitcoin and Standard and Poor's 500), precious metals (Gold and Silver), and energy markets (West Texas Instruments, Brent, and Gas). The generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model is applied to the return series. The wavelet packet Shannon entropy is calculated from the estimated volatility series to assess randomness. Hierarchical clustering is employed to examine interconnections between volatilities. We found that (i) randomness in volatility of the S&P500 and in the volatility of precious metals were the most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, while (ii) randomness in energy markets was less affected by the pandemic than equity and precious metal markets. Additionally, (iii) we showed an apparent emergence of three volatility clusters: precious metals (Gold and Silver), energy (Brent and Gas), and Bitcoin and WTI, and (iv) the S&P500 volatility represents a unique cluster, while (v) the S&P500 market volatility was not connected to the volatility of Bitcoin, energy, and precious metal markets before the pandemic. Moreover, (vi) the S&P500 market volatility became connected to volatility in energy markets and volatility in Bitcoin during the pandemic, and (vii) the volatility in precious metals is less connected to volatility in energy markets and to volatility in Bitcoin market during the pandemic. It is concluded that (i) investors may diversify their portfolios across single constituents of clusters, (ii) investing in energy markets during the pandemic period is appealing because of lower randomness in their respective volatilities, and that (iii) constructing a diversified portfolio would not be challenging as clustering structures are fairly stable across periods.","[Lahmiri, Salim] Concordia Univ, John Molson Sch Business, Dept Supply Chain & Business Technol Management, Montreal, PQ H3H 0A1, Canada; [Bekiros, Stelios] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, I-50014 Florence, Italy; [Bekiros, Stelios] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, 75 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada","Concordia University - Canada; European University Institute; Wilfrid Laurier University","Bekiros, S (corresponding author), European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, I-50014 Florence, Italy.;Bekiros, S (corresponding author), Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, 75 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.","salim.lahmiri@concordia.ca; stelios.bekiros@eui.eu","Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/K-4041-2014","Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/0000-0002-9376-8726","","","","","42","22","22","1","9","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1099-4300","","ENTROPY-SWITZ","Entropy","AUG","2020","22","8","","","","","","","833","10.3390/e22080833","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e22080833","","","13","Physics, Multidisciplinary","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Physics","NG6LD","33286604","gold, Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000564092300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, there appears to be a degree of misunderstanding about how consensus is applied across blockchains. To assist researchers considering variations between them, this study presents a rational classification of consensus methods applied to current blockchains. The study provides a survey of 19 methods classified by the scarce resource they employ: clock-cycles, bits, tokens, votes, time, and biometrics. Blockchain implementations are split between consensus algorithms requiring proof of resource and those that use majority voting to update the ledger.","[Nijsse, Jeff; Litchfield, Alan] Auckland Univ Technol, Serv & Cloud Comp Res Lab, Auckland 1010, New Zealand","Auckland University of Technology","Nijsse, J (corresponding author), Auckland Univ Technol, Serv & Cloud Comp Res Lab, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.","jeff.nijsse@aut.ac.nz; alan.litchfield@aut.ac.nz","",", J/0000-0002-4199-7201; Litchfield, Alan/0000-0002-3876-0940","","","","","40","9","9","2","6","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2410-387X","","CRYPTOGRAPHY-BASEL","Cryptography","DEC","2020","4","4","","","","","","","32","10.3390/cryptography4040032","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cryptography4040032","","","15","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Computer Science","PJ1RW","","Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000601555200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Prospect and Findings","INFORMATION","","","English","Article","","","","","","ETL; Bitcoin; blockchain; lambda architecture; blockchain analytics","","We present a novel strategy, based on the Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) process, to collect data from a blockchain, elaborate and make it available for further analysis. The study aims to satisfy the need for increasingly efficient data extraction strategies and effective representation methods for blockchain data. For this reason, we conceived a system to make scalable the process of blockchain data extraction and clustering, and to provide a SQL database which preserves the distinction between transaction and addresses. The proposed system satisfies the need to cluster addresses in entities, and the need to store the extracted data in a conventional database, making possible the data analysis by querying the database. In general, ETL processes allow the automation of the operation of data selection, data collection and data conditioning from a data warehouse, and produce output data in the best format for subsequent processing or for business. We focus on the Bitcoin blockchain transactions, which we organized in a relational database to distinguish between the input section and the output section of each transaction. We describe the implementation of address clustering algorithms specific for the Bitcoin blockchain and the process to collect and transform data and to load them in the database. To balance the input data rate with the elaboration time, we manage blockchain data according to the lambda architecture. To evaluate our process, we first analyzed the performances in terms of scalability, and then we checked its usability by analyzing loaded data. Finally, we present the results of a toy analysis, which provides some findings about blockchain data, focusing on a comparison between the statistics of the last year of transactions, and previous results of historical blockchain data found in the literature. The ETL process we realized to analyze blockchain data is proven to be able to perform a reliable and scalable data acquisition process, whose result makes stored data available for further analysis and business.","[Galici, Roberta; Ordile, Laura; Marchesi, Michele; Tonelli, Roberto] Univ Cagliari, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Via Osped 72, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy; [Pinna, Andrea] Univ Cagliari, Dept Elect & Elect Engn DIEE, Piazza DArmi, I-09100 Cagliari, Italy","University of Cagliari; University of Cagliari","Pinna, A (corresponding author), Univ Cagliari, Dept Elect & Elect Engn DIEE, Piazza DArmi, I-09100 Cagliari, Italy.","r.galicil@studenti.unica.it; l.ordile@studenti.unica.it; marchesi@unica.it; a.pinna@diee.unica.it; roberto.tonelli@dsf.unica.it","Pinna, Andrea/N-9983-2016","Pinna, Andrea/0000-0002-7530-0521; Marchesi, Michele/0000-0003-1540-8773; TONELLI, ROBERTO/0000-0002-9090-7698","Regione Autonoma della Sardegna","Regione Autonoma della Sardegna(Regione Sardegna)","This research was partially funded by Regione Autonoma della Sardegna, under project CAFCha-Programmazione unitaria 2014-2020 POR FESR Sardegna 2014-2020, and under project Crypto-Trading-Programmazione unitaria 2014-2020 POR FESR Sardegna 2014-2020.","","26","8","8","1","2","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2078-2489","","INFORMATION","Information","APR","2020","11","4","","","","","","","204","10.3390/info11040204","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info11040204","","","15","Computer Science, Information Systems","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Computer Science","LO8YL","","Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000533911600054","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this paper, we utilise algorithms for detecting turnings points to identify both bull and bear phases in high-frequency markets for the three largest cryptocurrencies of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. We also examine the market efficiency and liquidity of the selected cryptocurrencies during these periods using high-frequency data. Our findings show that the hourly returns of the three cryptocurrencies during a bull market indicate market efficiency when using the detrended-fluctuation-analysis (DFA) method to analyse the Hurst exponent with a rolling window. However, when conditions turn and there is a bear-market period, we see signs of a more inefficient market. Furthermore, our results indicated differences between the cryptocurrencies in terms of their liquidity during the two market states. Moving from a bull to a bear market, Ethereum and Litecoin appear to become more illiquid, as opposed to Bitcoin, which appears to become more liquid. The motivation to study the high-frequency cryptocurrency market came from the increasing availability of higher-frequency cryptocurrency-pricing data. However, it also comes from a movement towards higher-frequency trading of cryptocurrency. In addition, the efficiency of cryptocurrency markets relates not only to whether prices are predictable and arbitrage opportunities exist, but, more widely, to topics such as testing the profitability of trading strategies and determining the maturity of cryptocurrency markets.","[Zhang, Yuanyuan] Univ Manchester, Sch Math, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Chan, Stephen; Sulieman, Hana] Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Math & Stat, POB 26666, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Chu, Jeffrey] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Stat, E-28903 Getafe, Spain","University of Manchester; American University of Sharjah; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid","Chan, S (corresponding author), Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Math & Stat, POB 26666, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.","yuanyuan.zhang@manchester.ac.uk; schan@aus.edu; jchu@est-econ.uc3m.es; hsulieman@aus.edu","Sulieman, Hana/AAU-9551-2020; Chan, Stephen/AAE-2466-2020","Chan, Stephen/0000-0002-2312-2137","","","","","34","15","17","1","8","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

In this paper, we provide a novel methodology to calculate the probability of volatility clusters with a special emphasis on cryptocurrencies. With this aim, we calculate the Hurst exponent of a volatility series by means of the FD4 approach. An explicit criterion to computationally determine whether there exist volatility clusters of a fixed size is described. We found that the probabilities of volatility clusters of an index (S&P500) and a stock (Apple) showed a similar profile, whereas the probability of volatility clusters of a forex pair (Euro/USD) became quite lower. On the other hand, a similar profile appeared for Bitcoin/USD, Ethereum/USD, and Ripple/USD cryptocurrencies, with the probabilities of volatility clusters of all such cryptocurrencies being much greater than the ones of the three traditional assets. Our results suggest that the volatility in cryptocurrencies changes faster than in traditional assets, and much faster than in forex pairs.","[Nikolova, Venelina; Trinidad Segovia, Juan E.] Univ Almeria, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Fernandez-Martinez, Manuel] UPCT, MDE, Spanish Air Force Acad, Univ Ctr Def, Santiago De La Ribera 30720, Region De Murci, Spain; [Sanchez-Granero, Miguel Angel] Univ Almeria, Dept Math, Fac Sci, Almeria 04120, Spain","Universidad de Almeria; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; Universidad de Almeria","Segovia, JTE (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Almeria 04120, Spain.","vdn088@inlumine.ual.es; jetrini@ual.es; manuel.fernandez-martinez@cud.upct.es; misanche@ual.es","Fernández-Martínez, Manuel/J-5440-2014; GRANERO, MIGUEL ANGEL SANCHEZ/J-9350-2014; Fernández-Martínez, Manuel/ABG-8830-2020; Trinidad-Segovia, Juan E./K-5129-2019","Fernández-Martínez, Manuel/0000-0001-6291-9205; GRANERO, MIGUEL ANGEL SANCHEZ/0000-0001-9153-8321; Fernández-Martínez, Manuel/0000-0001-6291-9205; Trinidad-Segovia, Juan E./0000-0002-5017-2615","Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades, Spain; FEDER, Spain [PGC2018-097198-B-I00, PGC2018-101555-B-I00]; UAL/CECEU/FEDER, Spain [UAL18-FQM-B038-A]; CDTIME; Fundacion Seneca of Region de Murcia (Murcia, Spain) [20783/PI/18]","Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades, Spain(Spanish Government); FEDER, Spain(European CommissionSpanish Government); UAL/CECEU/FEDER, Spain; CDTIME; Fundacion Seneca of Region de Murcia (Murcia, Spain)(Fundacion Seneca)","Both J.E.

It is a technique originated in 2000 BC where simple methods were used in earlier times to keep the information in a way that is not understandable by everyone. Only the intended receiver knows how to decode the information. Later, as technology advances, many sophisticated techniques were used to protect the message so that no intrusion can invade the information. Many mathematically complex algorithms like AES, RSA are used to encrypt and decrypt the data. Due to the advancements in the computer science field, recently, cryptography is used in the development of cryptographic currencies of cryptocurrencies. Blockchain technology, a distributed ledger technology identified to be the foundation of Bitcoin cryptocurrency, implements a high-level cryptographic technique like public-key cryptography, Hash Functions, Merkle Trees, Digital signatures like Elliptic curve digital signatures, etc. These advanced cryptographic techniques are used to provide security to blockchain data and for the secure transmission of information, thereby making Blockchain more popular and demandable. Blockchain applies cryptography in various phases, and some of the techniques used in Blockchain are advanced in cryptographic sciences. This paper intends to provide a brief introduction to cryptography and Blockchain Technology and discusses how both technologies can be integrated to provide the best of the security to the data. This paper reviews the various cryptographic attacks in Blockchain and the various security services offered in Blockchain.

To support nodes to learn about possible paths to route their transactions, these networks need to provide gossip and probing mechanisms. This paper explores whether these mechanisms may be exploited to infer sensitive information about the flow of transactions, and eventually harm privacy. In particular, we identify two threats, related to an active and a passive adversary. The first is a probing attack: here the adversary aims the maximum amount which is transferable in a given direction of a target channel, by active probing. The second is a timing attack: the adversary discovers how close the destination of a routed payment actually is, by acting as a passive man-in-the middle. We then analyze the limitations of these attacks and propose remediations for scenarios in which they are able to produce accurate results.","[Nisslmueller, Utz; Foerster, Klaus-Tycho; Schmid, Stefan] Univ Vienna, Fac Comp Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Decker, Christian] Blockstream, Zurich, Switzerland","University of Vienna","Nisslmueller, U (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Fac Comp Sci, Vienna, Austria.","","Foerster, Klaus-Tycho/AAA-9479-2020","Foerster, Klaus-Tycho/0000-0003-4635-4480; Decker, Christian/0000-0002-8998-3570","","","","","22","9","9","1","2","SCITEPRESS","SETUBAL","AV D MANUELL, 27A 2 ESQ, SETUBAL, 2910-595, PORTUGAL","","","978-989-758-399-5","","","","2020","","","","","","","7","14","","10.5220/0009429200070014","http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0009429200070014","","","8","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP9RT","","hybrid, Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000570766300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Specifically, the estimations of nonlinear patterns are performed in empirical mode decomposition domain to obtain time-scale computed values. The main findings follow. For all markets, price long term fluctuations are persistent, whilst price short term fluctuations are anti-persistent. In addition, short term fluctuations are chaotic, while long term fluctuations are not. Furthermore, short term fluctuations are less affected by randomness than long term fluctuations. Moreover, the level of anti-persistence and the information content in short term fluctuations are similar across all four European markets. Besides, computed nonlinear statistics from intermediate fluctuations are in general lower than those from short fluctuations, and are higher than those from long fluctuations. Our methodology is also applied to Bitcoin, NASDAQ and VIX indices for comparison purpose. Some similarities in terms of randomness and dissimilarities in terms of long memory are clearly observed between European and US indices. Finally, it is found that the correlation between (i) long memory and chaos is positive, low, and not statistically significant, (ii) between long memory and randomness is positive, large, and statistically significant, and (iii) between chaos and randomness is negative, low, and not statistically significant.

The PoW process, which is also known as mining, is computationally intensive, because the miners need to solve a well-crafted puzzle to add a new block to the chain. With cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin becoming more popular, it requires greater levels of mining power for successful mining. Most miners tend to join specific mining pools to share rewards contributed by their mining power. This leads to more centralized PoWbased blockchain systems, which contradicts the design goal of decentralization for blockchain. Mining power concentration may damage the trust and secure level of blockchain systems. However, no tools or studies could timely and quantitatively tell us how decentralized in terms of mining power the PoW blockchain system is. in this article, we design a decentralization index, called Endex, to efficiently quantify the degree of mining power decentralization and timely capture the abnormal phenomena of PoW blockchain systems. We then validate the effectiveness and accuracy of Endex over real mining datasets of four popular blockchain systems. The empirical study demonstrates that Endex can well capture the changes in mining power for these blockchain systems and detect in time the abnormal incidents such as double spending attack and hard fork.","[Chen, Ren; Chuang, Kai-Er] Natl Taipei Univ, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Lin, Qin-Xue] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Elect Engn, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Liao, Shih-Wei] Natl Taipei Univ, Comp Sci Dept, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Liao, Wanjiun] Natl Taipei Univ, Internet Things Res Ctr, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Tu, I-Ping] Acad Sinica, Inst Stat Sci, Taipei, Taiwan","National Taipei University; National Taipei University; National Taipei University; National Taipei University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan","Chen, R (corresponding author), Natl Taipei Univ, New Taipei, Taiwan.","d03921017@ntu.edu.tw; iping@stat.sinica.edu.tw; b05901043@ntu.edu.tw; R08921047@ntu.edu.tw; liao@csie.ntu.edu.tw; wjliao@ntu.edu.tw","Tu, I-Ping/AAQ-5630-2021","Tu, I-Ping/0000-0001-8666-8391","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan [107-2218-E-002-032-MY3, 108-2218-E-002-050]; Education Department of Fujian Province [JAT170433]","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Education Department of Fujian Province","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan, under Grant Numbers 107-2218-E-002-032-MY3 and 108-2218-E-002-050; and the Education Department of Fujian Province under Grant Number JAT170433.","","14","4","4","1","8","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","0890-8044","1558-156X","","IEEE NETWORK","IEEE Netw.","NOV-DEC","2020","34","6","","","","","266","271","","10.1109/MNET.011.2000178","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MNET.011.2000178","","","6","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","PE8XD","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000598643800038","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Identification of such relations is crucial because their existence may be used to create a broad spectrum of analyses and reports about cryptocurrency projects and to obtain a comprehensive outlook of the blockchain domain. The activities on the blockchain reach different levels of anonymity which renders them hard objects of studies. In particular, the standard tools used to characterize social trends and variables that describe cryptocurrencies' situations are unsuitable to be used in the environment that extensively employs cryptographic techniques to hide real users. The employment of Wikipedia to trace crypto assets value need examination because the portal allows gathering of different opinions-content of the articles is edited by a group of people. Consequently, the information can be more attractive and useful for the readers than in case of non-collaborative sources of information. Wikipedia Articles often appears in the premium position of such search engines as Google, Bing, Yahoo and others. One may expect different demand on information about particular cryptocurrency depending on the different events (e.g., sharp fluctuations of price). Wikipedia offers only information about cryptocurrencies that are important from the point of view of language community of the users in Wikipedia. This filter helps to better identify those cryptocurrencies that have a significant influence on the regional markets. The models encompass linkages between different variables and properties. In one model cryptocurrency projects are ranked with the means of articles sentiment and quality. In another model, Wikipedia visits are linked to cryptocurrencies' popularity. Additionally, the interactions between information demand in different Wikipedia language versions are elaborated. They are used to assess the geographical esteem of certain crypto coins. The information about the legal status of cryptocurrency technologies in different states that are offered by Wikipedia is used in another proposed model. It allows assessment of the adoption of cryptocurrencies in a given legislature. Finally, a model is developed that joins Wikipedia articles editions and deletions with the social sentiment towards particular cryptocurrency projects. The mentioned analytical purposes that permit assessment of the popularity of blockchain technologies in different local communities are not the only results of the paper. The models can show which country has the biggest demand on particular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Monero, Litecoin, Dogecoin and others.","[Stolarski, Piotr; Lewoniewski, Wlodzimierz; Abramowicz, Witold] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Informat Syst, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland","Poznan University of Economics & Business","Stolarski, P (corresponding author), Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Informat Syst, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland.","Piotr.Stolarski@ue.poznan.pl; Wlodzimierz.Lewoniewski@ue.poznan.pl; Witold.Abramowicz@ue.poznan.pl","","Stolarski, Piotr/0000-0001-7076-2316; Lewoniewski, Wlodzimierz/0000-0002-0163-5492","","","","","56","3","3","3","17","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2078-2489","","INFORMATION","Information","APR","2020","11","4","","","","","","","234","10.3390/info11040234","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info11040234","","","26","Computer Science, Information Systems","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Computer Science","LO8YL","","Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000533911600050","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The open network and publicly stored data in a blockchain system, however, raise serious risks of data theft and user privacy leakage, which has become a core issue that restricts the blockchain technology from becoming practical. This article uses kleptography technology to design a blockchain covert data transmission scheme to achieve high-concealment and high-performance data transmission under open network conditions.

A user has one or more private keys to sign a transaction and send coins to others. The user locks her private keys with a password and stores them on a piece of software or a hardware wallet to protect them. A challenge in cryptocurrencies is losing access to private keys by its user, resulting in inaccessible coins. These coins are assigned to addresses which access to their private keys is impossible. Today, about 20 percent of all possible bitcoins are inaccessible and lost forever. A promising solution is the off-chain recovery transaction that aggregates all available coins to send them to an address when the private key is not accessible. Unfortunately, this recovery transaction must be regenerated after all sends and receives, and it is time-consuming to generate on hardware wallets. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism called lean recovery transaction to tackle this problem. We make a change in wallet key management to generate the recovery transaction as less frequently as possible. In our design, the wallet generates a lean recovery transaction only when needed and provides better performance, especially for micropayment. We evaluate the regular recovery transaction on two real hardware wallets and implement our proposed mechanism on a hardware wallet. We achieve a %40 percentage of less processing time for generating payment transactions with few numbers of inputs. The performance difference becomes even more significant, with a larger number of inputs.","[Rezaeighaleh, Hossein; Zou, Cliff C.] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Comp Sci, Orlando, FL 32816 USA","State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida","Rezaeighaleh, H (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Dept Comp Sci, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.","rezaei@knights.ucf.edu; czou@cs.ucf.edu","","","National Science Foundation [DGE-1915780, DGE-1723587]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","The National Science Foundation supported this work under grant DGE-1915780 and DGE-1723587.","","19","1","1","2","2","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","2324-898X","","978-1-6654-0392-4","IEEE INT CONF TRUST","","","2020","","","","","","","1903","1909","","10.1109/TrustCom50675.2020.00260","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom50675.2020.00260","","","7","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BR8DU","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000671077600246","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The key concept behind the development of Blockchain was to create a chain of data which is immutable, confidential, open- source and located on a de-centralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The ownership of Blockchain doesn't belong to a single person or a group but each node on the network therefore, it works without the involvement of any centralized authority. Blockchain was originally designed for cryptocurrency but this technology has been using in many other fields and application like Health, Finance, Banking and IOT etc. Big things come with big challenges so is the case with Blockchain and beside technical challenges, advancement in technology and hardware, Blockchain technology still claims flawless because of cryptographic primitives.

We also formulate a 'Hawkes disorder problem,' as generalization of the established Poisson disorder problem, and provide a simulation-based approach to determining an optimal observation horizon. Our analysis suggests that Bitcoin mid-price dynamics feature long-memory properties, well explained by the power-law kernel, at a level of criticality similar to fiat-currency markets.","[Mark, Michael; Weber, Thomas A.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Chair Operat Econ & Strategy, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Sila, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Fac Social Sci, Prague, Czech Republic","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Charles University Prague","Mark, M (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Chair Operat Econ & Strategy, Lausanne, Switzerland.","michael.mark@epfl.ch","Sila, Jan/X-1098-2018; Weber, Thomas A./C-3892-2018","Sila, Jan/0000-0001-8128-3847; Weber, Thomas A./0000-0003-2857-4754","Swiss National Science Foundation [105218-179175]; Charles University PRIMUS program [PRIMUS/19/HUM/17]; SVV project [260 463]","Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); Charles University PRIMUS program; SVV project","This work was jointly supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation [grant number 105218-179175], the Charles University PRIMUS program (PRIMUS/19/HUM/17) and SVV project 260 463.","","52","4","4","0","10","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1351-847X","1466-4364","","EUR J FINANC","Eur.

This paper proposes an algorithm that avoids double-spending in the short term with just O(root n) messages instead of O(n); each node receiving money off-chain performs the due diligence of consulting k root n random nodes to check if any of them is aware of double-spending. Two nodes receiving double-spent money will in this way consult at least one common node with very high probability, because of the 'birthday paradox', and any common honest node consulted will detect the fraud. Since the velocity of money in the real world has coins circulating through at most a few wallets per day, the size of the due diligence communication is small in the short term. This 'k-root-n' algorithm is suitable for an environment with synchronous or asynchronous (but with fairly low latency) communication and with Byzantine faults. The presented k-root-n algorithm should be practical to avoid double-spending with arbitrarily high probability, while feasibly coping with the throughput of all world commerce. It is resistant to Sybil attacks even beyond 50% of nodes. In the long term, the k-root-n algorithm is less efficient. Therefore, it should preferably be used as a complement, and not a replacement, to a global distributed ledger technology.","[Schreiber, Zvi] Univ Cambridge, Ex Imperial Coll, London, England","University of Cambridge","Schreiber, Z (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Ex Imperial Coll, London, England.","zvi@zvi.net","","Schreiber, Zvi/0000-0002-9832-4315","","","","","35","3","3","1","3","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2078-2489","","INFORMATION","Information","FEB","2020","11","2","","","","","","","90","10.3390/info11020090","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info11020090","","","16","Computer Science, Information Systems","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Computer Science","KU2MK","","Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000519542400031","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, micropayment scalability in a large LN and liquidation for small nodes still remain major challenges for the LN. In this paper, we introduce the notion of supernodes and the corresponding supernodes-based pooling to address these challenges. In order to meet the high adaptivity and low maintenance cost in the dynamic LN where users join and leave, supernodes are constructed locally without any global information or label propagation. Each supernode, together with a subset of (non-supernodes) neighbors, forms a supernode-based pool. These pools constitute a partition of the LN. Additionally, supernodes are self-connected. Micropayment scalability is supported through node set reduction as only supernodes are involved in searching and in payment with other supernodes. Liquidation is enhanced through pooling to redistribute funds within a pool to external channels of its supernode. Extensive simulations have been conducted to validate the improvement in routing scalability and liquidation of the proposed architecture under different settings.","[Wu, Jie; Jiang, Suhan] Temple Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University","Wu, J (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.","","","","NSF [CNS 1824440, CNS 1828363, CNS 1757533, CNS 1629746, CNS 1651947, CNS 1564128]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was supported in part by NSF grants CNS 1824440, CNS 1828363, CNS 1757533, CNS 1629746, CNS 1651947, and CNS 1564128.","","16","2","2","0","0","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-0-7381-0495-9","","","","2020","","","","","","","421","427","","10.1109/Blockchain50366.2020.00061","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain50366.2020.00061","","","7","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR3LS","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000647642100052","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, its applications are now more widespread, and in many areas, this technology has become the foundation of the distributed ledger. The blockchain protocol assumes that all the participants of the system are both contributors and safeguards of this ledger, since the lack of a trusted third party requires other security precautions in order to maintain the consistency of transactions. In this work, we investigate whether for the participants of a blockchain-based system that does not require revealing the character explicitly, it can be discovered by other means. In order to verify this, we built and publicly released a dataset of nearly 9,000 addresses of nodes in the most popular cryptocurrency - Bitcoin, and then labelled them. These labels represent the character the nodes have in the network, e.g. miners or exchanges. We then developed a set of features that quantify the behaviour of nodes in the network and used supervised machine learning algorithms to find out whether the character of nodes can be revealed based on these features. Our results demonstrate, due to the F-score reaching over 95% in the best-performing algorithms, that it is hard to hide the role the node has in a blockchain-based network. These results indicate that to build trustworthy blockchain-based systems that fully comply with original blockchain assumptions, specific countermeasures are needed in order to preserve the desired level of anonymity.","[Michalski, Radoslaw; Macek, Piotr] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Computat Intelligence, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland; [Dziubaltowska, Daria] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Math, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland","Wroclaw University of Science & Technology; Wroclaw University of Science & Technology","Michalski, R (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Computat Intelligence, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland.","radoslaw.michalski@pwr.edu.pl","Michalski, Radosław/I-6978-2013","Michalski, Radosław/0000-0002-0106-655X; Macek, Piotr/0000-0003-4995-4190; Dziubaltowska, Daria/0000-0002-2303-5607","Faculty of Computer Science and Management, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology","Faculty of Computer Science and Management, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology","This work was supported by the statutory funds of the Faculty of Computer Science and Management, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology.","","32","7","7","4","12","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","109639","109647","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3001676","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3001676","","","9","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","MH0II","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000546414000011","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Risk stratification is traditionally based on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and proteinuria. The present trial examines, whether tubular and inflammatory biomarkers are able to identify subjects at increased risk as well. Methods We performed a prospective study in 490 patients undergoing coronary angiography. An increase of serum creatinine concentration >= 0.3 mg/dl from baseline to day 2-3 was defined as primary endpoint (CI-AKI). Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and calprotectin were assessed < 24h before coronary angiography. Prognostic accuracy was assessed by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) calculations. Results 30 (6.1%) patients suffered from CI-AKI (27 AKIN stage I, 3 AKIN stage II, 0 AKIN stage III). Those subjects who developed CI-AKI had 3.1 fold higher baseline urinary NGAL/creatinine ratios than those without CI-AKI (60.8 [IQR 18.7-93.1] mu g/mg vs. 19.9 [IQR 12.3-38.9] mu g/mg, p = 0.001). In those subjects without clinically overt CKD (eGFR > 60 ml/min, urinary albumin creatinine ratio <30 mg/g), the NGAL/creatinine ratio was 2.6 higher in CI-AKI vs. no CI-AKI (47.8 [IQR 11.8-75.3] vs. 18.6 [IQR 11.7-36.3] mu g/mg). No significant differences were obtained for KIM-1 and calprotectin (p>0.05 each). ROC analyses revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.68 (95% CI 0.60-0.81) for NGAL/creatinine. An NGAL/creatinine ratio < 56.4 mu g/mg has a negative predictive value of 96.5%. Conclusions The present study is the largest investigation on the use of urinary biomarkers for CI-AKI risk stratification so far. It shows that NGAL provides prognostic information beyond the glomerular biomarkers eGFR and proteinuria.","[Seibert, Felix S.; Heringhaus, Anja; Rohn, Benjamin; Bauer, Frederic; Babel, Nina; Westhoff, Timm H.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Univ Hosp Marien Hosp Herne, Dept Nephrol, Herne, Germany; [Pagonas, Nikolaos] Brandenburg Med Sch Theodor Fontane, Ctr Internal Med 1, Dept Angiol, Brandenburg, Germany; [Rudolf, Henrik; Timmesfeld, Nina] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Med Informat Biometry & Epidemiol, Herne, Germany; [Trappe, Hans-Joachim] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Univ Hosp Marien Hosp Herne, Dept Cardiol, Herne, Germany","Ruhr University Bochum; St. Marien Hospital; Ruhr University Bochum; Ruhr University Bochum; St. Marien Hospital","Seibert, FS (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Univ Hosp Marien Hosp Herne, Dept Nephrol, Herne, Germany.","felix.seibert@elisabethgruppe.de","Babel, Nina/AAK-2034-2021","Rudolf, Henrik/0000-0001-9114-3805; Westhoff, Timm H./0000-0001-5797-834X; Babel, Nina/0000-0003-3673-712X","German Research Foundation [FOR1368]","German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG))","The study was funded by the German Research Foundation (Research Unit FOR1368; receiver TW).

However, the volatility transmissions are found to be different during the two sample periods for the Bitcoin-Ethereum and Bitcoin-Litecoin pairs. The constant conditional correlations between all pairs of cryptocurrencies are observed to be higher during the COVID-19 period compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Based on optimal weights, investors are advised to decrease their investments (a) in Bitcoin for the portfolios of Bitcoin/Ethereum and Bitcoin/Litecoin and (b) in Ethereum for the portfolios of Ethereum/Litecoin during the COVID-19 period. All hedge ratios are found to be higher during the COVID-19 period, implying a higher hedging cost compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Last, the hedging effectiveness is higher during the COVID-19 period compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Overall, these findings provide useful information to portfolio managers and policymakers regarding portfolio diversification, hedging, forecasting, and risk management.","[Yousaf, Imran; Ali, Shoaib] Air Univ, Sch Management, Islamabad, Pakistan","Air University Islamabad","Yousaf, I (corresponding author), Air Univ, Sch Management, Islamabad, Pakistan.","imranyousaf.fin@gmail.com","Ali, Shoaib/AAK-2396-2021; Yousaf, Imran/AAE-1107-2019","Ali, Shoaib/0000-0001-5954-9987; Yousaf, Imran/0000-0003-1968-293X","","","","","44","32","32","2","12","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","2199-4730","","FINANC INNOV","Financ.

Bitcoin is the most successful application of it. The reason behind Bitcoin's success lies in its Consensus mechanism which ensures the security from any kind of attack. Because of this, no dishonest miner can affect the chain to manipulate it according to their wish. Also, the double spending problem does not occur and there is no need to trust a third party in this network. The most common consensus protocol in bitcoin technology is Proof-of-Work (PoW) which entirely depends on the computation power of miners. Because of this dependency, Application-specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) is designed for bitcoin mining. Thereafter, it has become a threat to its decentralized nature and has been monopolizing the validation of new blocks. It is not possible to halt the production of ASIC-based devices even if it threatens the decentralized applications. So, different types of consensus protocols are proposed to nullify this threat whereas all of them have failed to fully nullify it. ASIC devices are costly, so only a few miners can afford it and monopolize over blockchain network. In our work, Filtered Proof-of-Work (FPoW) is proposed and its ASIC-resistivity has been evaluated to make it a future-proof ASIC-resistant consensus protocol.","[Ashik, Mahmudul Hassan; Maswood, Mirza Mohd Shahriar] Khulna Univ Engn & Technol, Dept ECE, Khulna, Bangladesh; [Alharbi, Abdullah G.] Jouf Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Sakakah 72388, Saudi Arabia; [Medhi, Deep] Univ Missouri, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA","Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET); Al Jouf University; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City","Ashik, MH (corresponding author), Khulna Univ Engn & Technol, Dept ECE, Khulna, Bangladesh.","ashik1509031@stud.kuet.ac.bd; mmnt7@mail.umkc.edu; a.g.alharbi@ieee.org; dmedhi@umkc.edu","Alharbi, Abdullah G./AFN-5483-2022","Alharbi, Abdullah G./0000-0002-1972-4741; Ashik, Mahmudul Hassan/0000-0002-0802-1688","","","","","26","2","2","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2640-821X","","978-1-7281-7366-5","IEEE REGION 10 SYMP","","","2020","","","","","","","1608","1611","","","","","","4","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering","BR4NF","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000652007300384","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Private sector issuance of distributed ledger technology (DLT)-based digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins threaten the stability of financial market infrastructures and preservation of monetary policy. Consequently, many central banks and monetary authorities have begun research and experimentation on central bank-issued digital currencies (CBDCs) to mitigate this threat. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of publicly available DLT-based CBDC experiments with completed proof-of-concept prototypes from across the world to enable an understanding of the motivations and best practice approaches for undertaking CBDC experiments. We provide a classification and generic framework for CBDCs and highlight existing DLT platform limitations and use cases in the financial services industry. Overall, our paper organizes in one place, all the relevant, publicly available DLT-based CBDC experiments with completed proof-of-concept prototypes to serve as a reference point for central banks, monetary authorities and researchers desiring to undertake research on DLT-based CBDCs. Ultimately, we present a survey on the technical feasibility and challenges of leveraging DLT to issue the selected CBDC experiments surveyed in this paper.","[Opare, Edwin Ayisi] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Global Informat & Telecommun Technol Program, Sch Business & Technol Management, Daejeon 34141, South Korea; [Kim, Kwangjo] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Comp, Daejeon 34141, South Korea","Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST)","Opare, EA (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Global Informat & Telecommun Technol Program, Sch Business & Technol Management, Daejeon 34141, South Korea.","edwin.opare@kaist.ac.kr","","Opare, Edwin/0000-0003-4549-8677","Global Information and Telecommunication Technology Program (GITTP) at KAIST; Ministry of Science and ICT of the Republic of Korea; Institute for Information Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant - Korea government (MSIT) [2017-0-00555]","Global Information and Telecommunication Technology Program (GITTP) at KAIST; Ministry of Science and ICT of the Republic of Korea; Institute for Information Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant - Korea government (MSIT)","This work was supported in part by the Global Information and Telecommunication Technology Program (GITTP) at KAIST with funding support from the Ministry of Science and ICT of the Republic of Korea, and in part by the Institute for Information Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2017-0-00555, Towards Provable-secure Multi-party Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol based on Lattices in a Quantum World).","","108","10","10","5","55","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","110810","110847","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3001970","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3001970","","","38","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","MH0II","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000546414000104","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Launched in 2018, the Lightning Network (LN) has been gaining popularity and consists today of more than 5000 nodes and 35000 payment channels that jointly hold 965 bitcoins (9.2M USD as of June 2020). This adoption has motivated research from both academia and industry. Payment channels suffer from security vulnerabilities, such as the wormhole attack [39], anonymity issues [38], and scalability limitations related to the upper bound on the number of concurrent payments per channel [28], which have been pointed out by the scientific community but never quantitatively analyzed. In this work, we first analyze the proneness of the LN to the wormhole attack and attacks against anonymity. We observe that an adversary needs to control only 2% of nodes to learn sensitive payment information (e.g., sender, receiver, and amount) or to carry out the wormhole attack. Second, we study the management of concurrent payments in the LN and quantify its negative effect on scalability. We observe that for micropayments, the forwarding capability of up to 50% of channels is restricted to a value smaller than the channel capacity. This phenomenon hinders scalability and opens the door for denial-of-service attacks: we estimate that a network-wide DoS attack costs within 1.6M USD, while isolating the biggest community costs only 238k USD. Our findings should prompt the LN community to consider the issues studied in this work when educating users about path selection algorithms, as well as to adopt multi-hop payment protocols that provide stronger security, privacy and scalability guarantees.","[Tikhomirov, Sergei] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Moreno-Sanchez, Pedro; Maffei, Matteo] TU Wien, Vienna, Austria","University of Luxembourg; Technische Universitat Wien","Tikhomirov, S (corresponding author), Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.","sergey.s.tikhomirov@gmail.com; pedro.sanchez@tuwien.ac.at; matteo.maffei@tuwien.ac.at","","Moreno-Sanchez, Pedro/0000-0003-2315-7839","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unions [771527-BROWSEC]; Austrian Research Promotion Agency [13808694]; COMET K1 SBA, ABC; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) through the Meitner program [M 2608-G27]; PROFET [P31621]; Chaincode Labs","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unions(European Research Council (ERC)); Austrian Research Promotion Agency; COMET K1 SBA, ABC; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) through the Meitner program(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); PROFET; Chaincode Labs","This work was partly supported by by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unions Horizon 2020 research (grant agreement No 771527-BROWSEC), by PROFET (grant agreement P31621), by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency through the Bridge-1 project PR4DLT (grant agreement 13808694); by COMET K1 SBA, ABC, by Chaincode Labs and by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) through the Meitner program (project agreement M 2608-G27).","","45","10","10","0","3","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-8597-2","","","","2020","","","","","","","387","396","","10.1109/EuroSPW51379.2020.00059","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EuroSPW51379.2020.00059","","","10","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BR0RG","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000630275400049","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It can be used for the implementation of automated processes such as device/system control, process control, distributed computing, storage, and others. The system provides a solution which uses a blockchain to control a process executing on a computing resource. In a preferred implementation, the computing resource, running simultaneously and in parallel to the blockchain, manages a loop-based operation. The computing resource continuously monitors the state of the blockchain and any other off-blockchain input data or source. The execution of the loop is influenced by the state of the blockchain. Each iteration of the loop that is executed by the computing resource is recorded in a transaction that is written to the blockchain. It is stored as a hash within the transaction's metadata. If the computing resource finds a transaction which contains a hash relating to the loop, it accesses the relevant portion of code. The loop contains a conditional statement which enables the computing resource to decide which action to take. The condition may be dependent upon the state of the blockchain or any other data source. The action can be any type of action, on or off the blockchain. Thus, the combination of the computing resource and the blockchain provides a solution which is (at least partially) Turing complete.","[Wright, Craig S.] CNAM, Paris, France","heSam Universite; Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay","Wright, CS (corresponding author), CNAM, Paris, France.","c.wright@nchain.com","","","","","","","7","0","0","0","1","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","2194-5357","2194-5365","978-3-030-29516-5; 978-3-030-29515-8","ADV INTELL SYST COMP","","","2020","1037","","","","","","253","265","","10.1007/978-3-030-29516-5_19","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-29516-5_19","","","13","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR2DE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000637312900019","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The quality of point forecasts is affected by spikes and bubbles in the trajectories of these processes, which also characterize many financial and economic time series. This is due to deformations of estimated predictive densities from multimodality during explosive episodes. We show that two-step-ahead predictive densities of future trajectories based on the MAR(1, 1) Cauchy process can be used as a new graphical tool for early detection of bubble outsets and bursts.

However, blockchain suffers from scalability issues. Sharding is the leading solution for blockchain scalability. Sharding splits the blockchain network into sub-chains called shards/committees. Each shard processes a sub-set of transactions, rather than the entire network processing all transactions. This raises security issues for sharding-based blockchain protocols. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to analyze the security of these protocols (e.g., OmniLedger and RapidChain). In particular, this methodology estimates the failure probability of one sharding round taking into consideration the failure probabilities of all shards.

New ways of generating energy, such as renewable resources that depend on many sources, including the sun and wind energy will contribute to the future of humankind largely and effectively. These renewable sources are facing major challenges that cannot be ignored which also require more researches on appropriate solutions. This has led to the emergence of a new type of network user called prosumer, which causes new challenges such as the intermittent nature of renewable. Smart grids have emerged as a solution to integrate these distributed energy sources. It also provides a mechanism to maintain safety and security for power supply networks. The main idea of smart grids is to facilitate local production and consumption By customers and consumers. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) or Block-chain technology has evolved dramatically since 2008 that coincided with the birth of its first application Bitcoin, which is the first cryptocurrency. This innovation led to sparked in the digital revolution, which provides decentralization, security, and democratization of information storage and transfer systems across numerous sectors/industries. Block-chain can be applied for the sake of the durability and safety of energy systems. In this paper, we will propose a new distributed framework that provides protection based on block-chain technology for energy systems to enhance self-defense capability against those cyber-attacks.","[Alkaeed, Mahdi] Qatar Univ, Comp Sci & Engn, Doha, Qatar; [Soliman, Md Mohiuddin] Int Islamic Univ, Elect & Telecommun Engn, Chittagong, Bangladesh; [Khan, Khaled M.] Qatar Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Coll Engn, Doha, Qatar; [Elfouly, Tarek M.] Qatar Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Coll Engn, Doha, Qatar","Qatar University; International Islamic University Chittagong (IIUC); Qatar University; Qatar University","Alkaeed, M (corresponding author), Qatar Univ, Comp Sci & Engn, Doha, Qatar.","ma1805365@qu.edu.qa; mohiuddinmohin86@gmail.com; k.khan@qu.edu.qa; tarekfouly@qu.edu.qa","","Soliman, Md Mohiuddin/0000-0002-0268-9978","Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF) [NPRP8-531-1-111]","Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)(National Research Foundation of KoreaQatar National Research Fund (QNRF))","This paper was made possible by Grant NPRP8-531-1-111 from Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF) The statements made herein are solely the responsibility of the authors.","","29","2","2","0","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-5313-1","","","","2020","","","","","","","100","105","","","","","","6","Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Automation & Control Systems; Engineering","BR1EK","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000631808500020","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Examples of leaking information constitute the amounts spent, the goods on which the amounts were spent, the spending locations and the users we exchange money with. This knowledge is powerful in the hands of those who have it, and can be used in multiple ways, not always to our benefit. Cryptocurrencies, such as the famous Bitcoin, were proposed as a means to address the limitations of centralized banking systems and to offer its users privacy with regards to their transactional data. In this work, we perform a systematic literature review on the realm of privacy for electronic currencies. We present the development of digital money from electronic cash to cryptocurrencies and focus on the techniques that are employed to enhance user-privacy. Furthermore, we present flaws of the current cryptocurrency systems, which reduce the privacy of the cryptocurrency users. Finally, we describe three research directions to enhance privacy for cryptocurrencies: transaction propagation mechanisms, succinct ZK proof systems without a trusted setup, and specialised trustless zero-knowledge proofs.","[Herskind, Lasse; Katsikouli, Panagiota; Dragoni, Nicola] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Compute, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark","Technical University of Denmark","Katsikouli, P (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Compute, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.","panka@dtu.dk","","Herskind, Lasse/0000-0002-9235-6383; Dragoni, Nicola/0000-0001-9575-2990","Danish Industry Foundation (Industriens Fonds) [2019-0046]","Danish Industry Foundation (Industriens Fonds)","This work was supported by the Danish Industry Foundation (Industriens Fonds) under Grant 2019-0046.","","91","9","9","11","36","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","54044","54059","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2980950","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2980950","","","16","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","LB6NA","","Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000524749300013","View Full Record in Web of Science"

These cryptograms, generally called puzzles, require the use of a certain amount of resources to be solved, hence introducing a cost that is often regarded as a time delay-though it could involve other metrics as well, such as bandwidth. These powerful features have made puzzles the core of many security protocols, acquiring increasing importance in the IT security landscape. The concept of a puzzle has subsequently been extended to other types of schemes that do not use cryptographic functions, such as CAPTCHAs, which are used to discriminate humans from machines. Overall, puzzles have experienced a renewed interest with the advent of Bitcoin, which uses a CPU-intensive puzzle as proof of work. In this article, we provide a comprehensive study of the most important puzzle construction schemes available in the literature, categorizing them according to several attributes, such as resource type, verification type, and applications. We have redefined the term puzzle by collecting and integrating the scattered notions used in different works, to cover all the existing applications. Moreover, we provide an overview of the possible applications, identifying key requirements and different design approaches. Finally, we highlight the features and limitations of each approach, providing a useful guide for the future development of new puzzle schemes.","[Ali, Isra Mohamed; Caprolu, Maurantonio; Di Pietro, Roberto] Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ HBKU, Coll Sci & Engn CSE, Div Informat & Comp Technol ICT, Qatar Fdn, POB 5825, Doha, Qatar","Qatar Foundation (QF); Hamad Bin Khalifa University-Qatar","Ali, IM (corresponding author), Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ HBKU, Coll Sci & Engn CSE, Div Informat & Comp Technol ICT, Qatar Fdn, POB 5825, Doha, Qatar.","isali@hbku.edu.qa; mcaprolu@hbku.edu.qa; rdipietro@hbku.edu.qa","Caprolu, Maurantonio/AAR-1333-2020","Caprolu, Maurantonio/0000-0001-8237-0539; Ali, Isra/0000-0002-2689-348X","QNRF-Qatar National Research Fund, a member of The Qatar Foundation [NPRP 11S-0109-180242]","QNRF-Qatar National Research Fund, a member of The Qatar Foundation(Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF))","This publication was partially supported by Award No. NPRP 11S-0109-180242, from the QNRF-Qatar National Research Fund, a member of The Qatar Foundation.

BlockSim is designed to support the analysis of a large variety of blockchains and blockchain deployments as well as a wide set of analysis questions. At the core of BlockSim is a Base Model, which contains the main model constructs common across various blockchain systems organized in three abstraction layers (network, consensus, and incentives layer). The Base Model is usable for a wide variety of blockchain systems and can be extended easily to include system or deployment particulars. The BlockSim software tool provides a simulator that implements the Base Model in Python. The paper describes the Base Model, the simulator implementation, and the application of BlockSim to Bitcoin, Ethereum and other consensus algorithms. We validate BlockSim simulation results by comparison with performance results from actual systems and from other studies in the literature. We close the paper by a BlockSim simulation study of the impact of uncle blocks rewards on mining decentralization, for a variety of blockchain configurations.","[Alharby, Maher; van Moorsel, Aad] Newcastle Univ, Sch Comp, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Alharby, Maher] Taibah Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Medina, Saudi Arabia","Newcastle University - UK; Taibah University","Alharby, M (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Comp, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.;Alharby, M (corresponding author), Taibah Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Medina, Saudi Arabia.","m.w.r.alharby2@ncl.ac.uk","","","","","","","28","18","18","4","7","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","2624-7852","","","FRONT BLOCKCHAIN","Front.

Blockchain is being applied in an increasing number of fields. Supply chain finance is a financing model in which banks connect core enterprises with upstream and downstream enterprises to provide flexible financial products and services. In the traditional supply chain finance, the core enterprises with strong competitiveness and a large scale play an irreplaceable role in managing the supply chain information flow, logistics, and capital flow, which results in inequality and information asymmetry. Fraud in supply chain finance is also very serious. To solve the problems of the traditional supply chain finance, in this article, we build a new type of supply chain financial platform that uses blockchain technology to manage the whole process. This supply chain financial platform solves the problem of nontrust among the participants in the supply chain, improves the efficiency of the capital flow and information flow, reduces costs, and provides better financial services to the relevant parties in the supply chain. To protect users' privacy, we propose a new method of using homomorphic encryption in the blockchain to meet the needs of sensitive data privacy protection in supply chain financial scenarios.","[Du, Mingxiao; Chen, Qijun; Xiao, Jie; Yang, Houhao; Ma, Xiaofeng] Tongji Univ, Dept Control Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China","Tongji University","Ma, XF (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Dept Control Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.","shiiod@163.com; qjchen@tongji.edu.cn; 1531789@tongji.edu.cn; 13121156397@163.com; xiaofengma@tongji.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61733013, 61673300]; Science andTechnology Commission of Shanghai Municipality [18DZ1200804]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science andTechnology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(Science & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM))","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61733013 andGrant 61673300, and in part by the Science andTechnology Commission of Shanghai Municipality under Grant 18DZ1200804.

We selected four cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and XRP) with large market values, and Bitcoin and BCH (Bitcoin Cash) for hard fork analysis; a hard fork is when a single cryptocurrency splits in two. By examining the real price data, we show that the long-term time series includes too much noise obscuring the local information flow; thus, a dynamic calculation is needed. The long-term and short-term sliding transfer entropy (TE) values and the corresponding p-values, based on daily data, indicate that there is a dynamic information flow. The dominant direction of which is <mml:mstyle>price</mml:mstyle>-> <mml:mstyle>volume</mml:mstyle>. In addition, the example based on minute Bitcoin data also shows a dynamic flow of information between price and transaction volume.

A potentially promising solution is the state channel architecture. State channels are more general than payment channels, which provide off-chain transaction settlement without much need for expensive on-chain operations. We investigate the routing optimization problem for Photon, a state channel network for Spectrum, which is similar to Raiden being a 2nd layer state channel network on top of Ethereum. Yet Photon possesses interesting characteristics that Raiden lacks. Extensive simulations show our proposed algorithm can effectively achieve high success rate and throughput with low deposit lockup.","[Ding, Xiaowei] Nanjing Univ, Sch Informat Management, 163 Xianlin Rd, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Ren, Litai] Nanjing Univ, Sch Chem, 163 Xianlin Rd, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Sang, Zizhou] Nanjing Univ, Sch Engn Management, 163 Xianlin Rd, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zijie; Du, Yifan] Nanjing Univ, Sch Math, 163 Xianlin Rd, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Yan, Peter] SmartMesh Fdn Pte Ltd, Singapore, Singapore; [Yan, Peter] MeshBox Fdn Pte Ltd, Singapore, Singapore; [Ding, Xiaowei; Ren, Litai; Sang, Zizhou; Zhang, Zijie; Du, Yifan] Nanjing Univ, Inclus & Rural Financial Technol Innovat Res Ctr, 163 Xianlin Rd, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China","Nanjing University; Nanjing University; Nanjing University; Nanjing University; Nanjing University","Ding, XW (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Informat Management, 163 Xianlin Rd, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.;Yan, P (corresponding author), SmartMesh Fdn Pte Ltd, Singapore, Singapore.;Yan, P (corresponding author), MeshBox Fdn Pte Ltd, Singapore, Singapore.;Ding, XW (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Inclus & Rural Financial Technol Innovat Res Ctr, 163 Xianlin Rd, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.","dingxiaowei@nju.edu.cn; peter@smartmesh.io","","","","","","","19","1","1","0","2","SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD","SINGAPORE","152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE","1865-0929","1865-0937","978-981-15-3278-8; 978-981-15-3277-1","COMM COM INF SC","","","2020","1176","","","","","","231","241","","10.1007/978-981-15-3278-8_16","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-3278-8_16","","","11","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR9ZL","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000680423400016","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In addition, academics increasingly acknowledge the predictive power of Twitter for a wide variety of events and more specifically for financial markets. This paper studies to what extent public Twitter sentiment can be used to predict price returns for the nine largest cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar and TRON. By using a cryptocurrency-specific lexicon-based sentiment analysis approach, financial data and bilateral Granger-causality testing, it was found that Twitter sentiment has predictive power for the returns of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Using a bullishness ratio, predictive power is found for EOS and TRON. Finally, a heuristic approach is developed to discover that at least 1-14% of the obtained Tweets were posted by Twitter bot accounts. This paper is the first to cover the predictive power of Twitter sentiment in the setting of multiple cryptocurrencies and to explore the presence of cryptocurrency-related Twitter bots.

Firstly, we implement the technique of Diebold-Yilmaz to compute the spillover index between cryptocurrencies and currency markets. We find a significant return spillover effect between Bitcoin and Litecoin in the first three quarters of 2017. Still, the return spillover is merely meaningful in the first three quarters of 2015 for Ripple. However, the total volatility spillover index in the system decreases in the fourth quarter of 2017. Secondly, we apply the Bayesian graphical structural vector, autoregressive estimations, and find that the current level of Bitcoin depends only on the previous level of the Chinese Yuan. The current level of Ripple strongly depends on the prior levels of Bitcoin, followed by Litecoin. The current level of Litecoin strongly depends on the previous level of Ripple, followed by the Chinese Yuan. These results indicate that there is a significant causal relationship among cryptocurrencies. However, except for the Chinese Yuan, major traditional currencies do not significantly affect cryptocurrencies.","[Elsayed, Ahmed H.] Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Durham, England; [Elsayed, Ahmed H.] Zagazig Univ, Fac Commerce, Dept Econ, Zagazig, Egypt; [Gozgor, Giray] Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Istanbul, Turkey; [Lau, Chi Keung Marco] Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield Business Sch, Dept Accountancy Finance & Econ, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England","Durham University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Zagazig University; Istanbul Medeniyet University; University of Huddersfield","Gozgor, G (corresponding author), Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.","giray.gozgor@medeniyet.edu.tr","Gozgor, Giray/K-1372-2017; Lau, Chi Keung/T-7850-2019","Gozgor, Giray/0000-0003-1238-8105; Lau, Chi Keung/0000-0002-2430-5592; Elsayed, Ahmed/0000-0002-7506-5963","","","","","42","15","15","3","19","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1076-9307","1099-1158","","INT J FINANC ECON","Int.

Because of the rapid growth in their popularity, ICOs have become a prominent research topic. However, the lack of knowledge about the nature of this kind of financial operation inevitably raises several important unanswered questions. This study starts by providing a comprehensive description of the characteristics, benefits, and risks associated with ICOs. Then, using a panel data set comprising daily information for 125 ICOs (44,217 observations gathered from December 2017 to December 2018), this study explores the influence of the ICO presale period, ICO category, Bitcoin spot returns, Bitcoin futures returns, and sentiment extracted from social media on ICO returns. The results suggest that while Bitcoin spot and Bitcoin futures returns exert a positive influence on ICO returns, the existence of a presale period exerts a negative influence, and ICO category seems to be non-significant. Sentiment extracted from social networks positively influences ICO returns. Further conclusions of this study are presented in the last section.","[Domingo, Ribeiro-Soriano] Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain; [Pineiro-Chousa, Juan; Angeles Lopez-Cabarcos, M.] Santiago de Compostela Univ, Santiago De Compostela, Spain","University of Valencia; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela","Domingo, RS (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain.","domingo.ribeiro@uv.es; j.pineiro@usc.es; angeles.lopez.cabarcos@usc.es","Ribeiro-Soriano, Domingo/G-5798-2015; Piñeiro-Chousa, Juan/AAU-8264-2020","Ribeiro-Soriano, Domingo/0000-0003-3222-9101; Piñeiro-Chousa, Juan/0000-0002-4639-8435","","","","","81","23","23","5","28","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","0040-1625","1873-5509","","TECHNOL FORECAST SOC","Technol.

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies bear a significant resemblance to base money or central bank money. This functional similarity can potentially pose several challenges to central banks in various dimensions. It may pose risks to central banks' monopoly over issuing base money, price stability, the smooth operation of payment systems, the conduct of monetary policy, and to the stability of credit institutions and the financial system. From among several potential policy responses, central banks have been investigating and experimenting with issuing central bank digital currency (CBDC). This paper investigates CBDC from a legal perspective and sheds light on the legal challenges of introducing CBDC in the euro area. Having studied the potential impact of issuing CBDC by the European Central Bank (ECB), particularly on the banking and financial stability, the efficient allocation of resources (i.e. credit), as well as on the conduct of monetary policy, the paper concludes that issuing CBDC by the ECB would face a set of legal challenges that need to be resolved before its issuance at the eurozone level. Resolving such legal challenges may prove to be an arduous task as it may ultimately need amendments to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.","[Nabilou, Hossein] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Nabilou, Hossein] UCL, Amsterdam Ctr Law & Econ ACLE, Ctr Blockchain Technol UCL CBT, London, England","University of Luxembourg; University of London; University College London","Nabilou, H (corresponding author), Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.;Nabilou, H (corresponding author), UCL, Amsterdam Ctr Law & Econ ACLE, Ctr Blockchain Technol UCL CBT, London, England.","hossein.nabilou@uni.lu","","Nabilou, Hossein/0000-0001-8020-473X","","","","","111","15","16","1","73","PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD","BASINGSTOKE","BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND","1745-6452","1750-2071","","J BANK REGUL","J.

Blockchain technology and blockchain cryptocurrencies are the best means to confront this new trustless economy. Millions of smart devices are able to complete transparent financial transactions via blockchain technology and its related cryptocurrencies. However, via blockchain technology, internet-connected devices may be hacked to mine cryptocurrencies. In this regard, monitoring the network of these blockchain-based transactions can be very useful to detect the abnormal behavior of users of these cryptocurrencies. Therefore, the trustworthiness of the transactions can be assured. In this paper, a novel procedure is proposed to monitor the network of blockchain cryptocurrency transactions. To do so, a hidden Markov multi-linear tensor model (HMTM) is utilized to model the transactions among nodes of the blockchain network.

Blockchain can be viewed as a distributed platform that holds transactional records without the involvement of a central authority, and where ensuring decentralization, transparency and security is of paramount importance. But the transparency requirement, absolutely necessary for improving trust among the blockchain's users, came with a price: lack of privacy. In most of the blockchains which are based on Bitcoin's Blockchain, anyone can query the blockchain and see all the transactions. This introduces a privacy issue which needs to be addressed. Although there are a few solutions for mitigating the privacy concern, we consider that true anonymity must be built-in, not added on trough extensions to the base protocol. We propose a novel solution, called RandAdminSuite, that addresses the blockchain privacy problem through a comprehensive approach that covers the blockchain architecture itself, transaction mechanism and cryptocurrency as well. RandAdminSuite offers some improvements over the concept of currency rewards for transaction processing nodes. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Computational puzzles have long been investigated as a possible sybil defense: nodes that fail to solve the puzzle in time will no longer be accepted by other nodes. However, a malicious node can behave in such a way that it is accepted by some honest nodes but not other honest nodes. This results in different honest nodes having different views on which set of nodes constitute the system. Such view divergence, unfortunately, breaks the overarching assumption required by many existing security protocols. Partly spurred by the growing popularity of Bitcoin, researchers have recently formalized the above view divergence problem and proposed interesting solutions (which we call view reconciliation protocols). All existing view reconciliation protocols so far have a similar Theta(N) time complexity, with N being the number of honest nodes in the system. As this paper's main contribution, we propose a novel view reconciliation protocol whose time complexity is only Theta(lnN/ln lnN). To achieve such an exponential improvement, we aggressively exploit randomization. The hidden constant factor in the asymptotic complexity of our protocol, however, is considerably larger than in previous protocols. Concrete numerical comparisons show that our protocol is more suitable for large-scale systems, while existing protocols are better for smaller-scale systems.","[Hou, Ruomu; Jahja, Irvan; Luu, Loi; Saxena, Prateek; Yu, Haifeng] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Comp, Singapore 117417, Singapore; [Luu, Loi] Kyber Network, Singapore 059818, Singapore","National University of Singapore","Jahja, I (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Comp, Singapore 117417, Singapore.","houruomu@comp.nus.edu.sg; irvan@comp.nus.edu.sg; loiluu@kyber.network; prateeks@comp.nus.edu.sg; haifeng@comp.nus.edu.sg","","Hou, Ruomu/0000-0002-3846-0745","Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier-1 [T1_251RES1616]; DSO, Singapore [R-252-000-661-592]","Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier-1(Ministry of Education, Singapore); DSO, Singapore(DSO National Laboratories)","This work was supported in part by the Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier-1 under Grant T1_251RES1616 and in part by DSO, Singapore, under Grant R-252-000-661-592.

Our survey indicates that public embrace of cryptocurrencies continues to lag as the masses currently show reluctance in embracing cryptocurrencies as a complement, let alone a substitute to fiat counterparts. Governments have also successfully defended their sovereignty in preserving legal tender status, structural seigniorage and exclusivity. Market-based studies hint at consistent inefficiencies across the spectrum. Furthermore, whether fundamental and mining factors determine cryptocurrencies' values remain unsettled. The most promising areas of research for crypto-financial intelligentsia would be delving into establishing trial runs for central bank-backed cryptocurrencies. In addition, we highlight that several methodological and data-based obstacles remain in assessing the link between cryptocurrencies and their traditional rivals.

The quality of a project affects the trust in the platform, and therefore the value of the digital tokens exchanged over it. In this paper, we investigate whether developers' emotions can effectively provide insights that can improve the prediction of the price of tokens. We consider developers' comments and activity for two major blockchain projects, namely Ethereum and Bitcoin, extracted from Github. We measure sentiment and emotions (joy, love, anger, etc.) of the developers' comments over time, and test the corresponding time series (i.e. theaffect time series) for correlations and causality with the Bitcoin/Ethereum time series of prices. Our analysis shows the existence of a Granger-causality between the time series of developers' emotions and Bitcoin/Ethereum price. Moreover, using an artificial recurrent neural network (LSTM), we can show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)-associated with the prediction of the prices of cryptocurrencies-significantly decreases when including the affect time series.","[Bartolucci, Silvia] Imperial Coll, Business Sch, London, England; [Destefanis, Giuseppe] Brunel Univ London, London, England; [Ortu, Marco] Univ Cagliari, DIEE, Cagliari, Italy; [Uras, Nicola; Marchesi, Michele; Tonelli, Roberto] Univ Cagliari, DMI, Cagliari, Italy; [Bartolucci, Silvia; Destefanis, Giuseppe] UCL, Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England","Imperial College London; Brunel University; University of Cagliari; University of Cagliari; University of London; University College London","Bartolucci, S (corresponding author), Imperial Coll, Business Sch, London, England.;Bartolucci, S (corresponding author), UCL, Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England.","s.bartolucci@imperial.ac.uk","Destefanis, Giuseppe/K-6340-2019","Destefanis, Giuseppe/0000-0003-3982-6355; Bartolucci, Silvia/0000-0003-1127-5600; ORTU, MARCO/0000-0003-4191-5058","UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies as part of the 1st Internal Call for Project Proposals on Distributed Ledger Technologies","UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies as part of the 1st Internal Call for Project Proposals on Distributed Ledger Technologies","SB, GD and MO acknowledge funding by UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies as part of the 1st Internal Call for Project Proposals on Distributed Ledger Technologies.","","56","6","6","1","12","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","2193-1127","","EPJ DATA SCI","EPJ Data Sci.","JUL 23","2020","9","1","","","","","","","21","10.1140/epjds/s13688-020-00239-6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-020-00239-6","","","18","Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences","MO4PP","","Green Submitted, Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000551510400001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Design/methodology/approach Within the scope of the literature review, the characteristics of cryptocurrencies and how these characteristics facilitate money laundering are discussed. To investigate concrete methods that money launderers use, a qualitative study with 10 presumed money launderers and 18 prevention experts was conducted. The results were subsequently tested quantitatively. Thereafter, the novel Liechtenstein blockchain act is discussed and it is detailed how the legislation could contribute to the establishment of an international standard in blockchain regulation. Findings Money launderers continue to abuse cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as vehicles for financial crime. The Liechtenstein Blockchain Act could serve as a benchmark for regulators around the world aiming to solve the issue. Research limitations/implications Current anti-money laundering regulations are rather ineffective when it comes to cryptocurrencies.

Extremely rapid price accelerations, often referred to as explosive behaviors, followed by drastic drops pose high risks to investors. From a risk management perspective, testing the explosiveness of individual cryptocurrency time series is not the only crucial issue. Investigating co-explosivity in the cryptoassets, i.e., whether explosivity in one cryptocurrency leads to explosivity in other cryptocurrencies, allows indeed to take into account possible shock propagation channels and improve the prediction of market collapses. To this aim, our paper investigates the relationships between the explosive behaviors of cryptocurrencies through a unit root testing approach.","[Agosto, Arianna] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Cafferata, Alessia] Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, I-53100 Siena, Italy","University of Pavia; University of Siena","Agosto, A (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.","arianna.agosto@unipv.it; alessia.cafferata@unisi.it","","Cafferata, Alessia/0000-0003-3618-9020; Agosto, Arianna/0000-0001-6551-086X","","","","","25","16","18","1","10","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-9091","","RISKS","Risks","JUN","2020","8","2","","","","","","","34","10.3390/risks8020034","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/risks8020034","","","14","Business, Finance","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Business & Economics","MO0KQ","","gold, Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000551226600024","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the authors apply the MS-ARMA model on daily returns of Bitcoin (19/04/2013-13/02/2018), Ripple (05/08/2013-14/02/2018), Litcoin (29/04/2013-14/02/2018) and Ethereum (08/02/2015-14/02/2018). This model allows capture of the nonlinear structure in both the conditional mean and the conditional variance of cryptocurrency returns. Findings All the cryptocurrency markets show regime switching in the return-generating process. Market dynamics seem to be governed by two different states which differ from one cryptocurrency market to another in terms of mean return, volatility and interstate dynamics. These findings can be explained by investors' behavior, i.e. speculative trading and herding behavior. By choosing to participate (or imitating some investors) in some cryptocurrency markets (in particular Bitcoin market), they affect the price movements and therefore the market dynamics in the short run. Practical implications Identifying the different market states provides information for investors to make more accurate portfolio decisions in the virtual market and follow the market timing strategy. Originality/value This paper attempts to analyze potential nonlinear structure in cryptocurrencies returns and analyze if there is a difference between the cryptocurrencies market cycles. So, the search for congruent and adequate specification to reproduce the stock returns dynamics in the virtual market still remains the concern of several empirical studies.

Although Bitcoin has many desirable properties, one of its fundamental shortcomings is its inability to process transactions at high rates. To address this challenge, many subsequent protocols either modify the rules of block acceptance (longest chain rule) and reward, or alter the graphical structure of the public ledger from a tree to a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Motivated by these approaches, we introduce a new general framework that captures ledger growth for a large class of DAG-based implementations. With this in hand, and by assuming honest miner behaviour, we (experimentally) explore how different DAG-based protocols perform in terms of fairness, as well as efficiency. To do so, we isolate different parameters of the network (such as k, the number of pointers to previous blocks) and study their effect on those performance metrics. Our results demonstrate how the DAG-based ledger protocols described by our framework cope with a high transaction load. More specifically, we show that even in a scenario where every miner on the system is honest in terms of when they publish blocks, what they point to, and what transactions each block contains, fairness and efficiency of this kind of ledgers can break down at specific hash rates if miners have differing levels of connectivity to the P2P network sustaining the protocol.

Therefore, blockchain technology has a good application prospect in various industries. As the most successful application of blockchain technology, the Bitcoin system applies the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. Under the PoW consensus mechanism, each miner competes through his own power to solve a SHA256 mathematical problem together, so as to gain profits. Due to the difficulty of the cryptography puzzle, miners tend to join the mining pool to obtain stable income. And the block withholding attacks will be carried out between the mining pools, so as to maximize his own income by controlling the infiltration rate dispatched to other mining pools. In this paper, we build a game model between mining pools based on the PoW consensus algorithm, and analyze its Nash equilibrium from two perspectives. The influence of the mining pools' power, the ratio of the power to be infiltrated, and the betrayed rate of dispatched miners on the mining pool's infiltration rate selection and income were explored, and the results were obtained through numerical simulations.","[Li, Wenbai] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Li, Wenbai; Cao, Mengwen; Wang, Yue; Lin, Feilong] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Coll Math & Comp Sci, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Tang, Changbing] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Coll Phys & Elect Informat Engn, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Zhejiang Normal University; Zhejiang Normal University; Zhejiang Normal University","Lin, FL (corresponding author), Zhejiang Normal Univ, Coll Math & Comp Sci, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.","bruce_lin@zjnu.edu.cn","Lin, Feilong/GRN-9551-2022","Lin, Feilong/0000-0003-0981-3721","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61877055]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LY18F030013]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61877055, and in part by the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant LY18F030013.","","20","19","19","4","21","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","101049","101060","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2997996","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2997996","","","12","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","LZ3LG","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000541129100034","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Findings We obtained support for our hypothesized notion that knowledge of cryptocurrencies, trust in government, and the speed of transactions are the main factors contributing to consumers' trust in cryptocurrencies. Our research makes several important theoretical contributions. First, we demonstrate that consumers who understand and know how cryptocurrencies work are more likely to trust and invest in the currency. Next, we demonstrate that consumers are more likely to trust cryptocurrencies and their peer-to-peer transactions if, preferably, they take place via a central issuer and are regulated by their respective governments. Originality/value This study is the first known paper to focus on cryptocurrencies from the consumers' perspective. Next, we identify key antecedents of trust towards cryptocurrencies.

Finally, FinTech firms and banks (should they choose to enter the cryptocurrency market) need not spend time and money on marketing, advertising, and promotions in order to try to allay consumers' anxiety when it comes to their uptake in the different digital currencies. Rather, this would allow the FinTech firms and banks to allocate resources to focus their attention on marketing, advertising and promoting the factors (i.e. knowledge, trust in government, and speed of transaction) that drive intent to invest in cryptocurrencies.","[Arli, Denni; Bakpayev, Marat] Univ Minnesota, Dept Mkt, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; [van Esch, Patrick] Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Mkt, Auckland, New Zealand; [Laurence, Andrea] Western Sydney Univ, Dept Mkt, Penrith, NSW, Australia","University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth; Auckland University of Technology; Western Sydney University","Arli, D (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Mkt, Duluth, MN 55812 USA.","darli@d.umn.edu; Patrick.van.esch@aut.ac.nz; mbakpaye@umn.edu; andrea.laurence@outlook.com","van Esch, Patrick/ABE-9472-2021; Arli, Denni/AAK-4715-2021","van Esch, Patrick/0000-0002-0541-9340; Arli, Denni/0000-0002-6320-3994","","","","","90","14","14","15","84","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","0263-4503","1758-8049","","MARK INTELL PLAN","Mark.

Two noteworthy characteristics of the returns of non-stablecoin cryptoassets are their high volatility, which brings with it a high level of risk, and their high intraclass correlation, which limits the benefits that can be had by diversifying across multiple cryptoassets. Yet cryptoassets exhibit no correlation with gold, a highly-liquid yet scarce asset which has proved to function as a safe haven during crises affecting traditional financial systems. As exemplified by Shannon'sDemon, a lack of correlation between assets opens the door to principled risk control through so-called volatility harvesting involving periodic rebalancing. In this paper we propose an index which combines a basket of five cryptoassets with an investment in gold in away that aims to improve the risk profile of the resulting portfolio while preserving its independence frommainstream financial asset classes such as stocks, bonds and fiat currencies. We generalise the theory of Equal Risk Contribution to allow for weighting according to a desired level of contribution to volatility. We find a crypto-gold weighting based on Weighted Risk Contribution to be historically more effective in terms of Sharpe Ratio than several alternative asset allocation strategies including Shannon's Demon. Within the crypto-basket, whose constituents are selected and rebalanced monthly, we find an EqualWeighting scheme to be more effective in terms of the same metric than a market capitalisation weighting.","[Koutsouri, Aikaterini; Knottenbelt, William J.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Comp, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Poli, Francesco; Distaso, Walter] Imperial Coll London, Dept Finance, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Alfieri, Elise] Univ Grenoble Alpes, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Petch, Michael] CoinShares, 5 Cheapside, London EC2V 6AA, England","Imperial College London; Imperial College London; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA)","Koutsouri, A (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Comp, London SW7 2AZ, England.","k.koutsouri@imperial.ac.uk; f.poli@imperial.ac.ok; Elise.Alfieri@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr; mpetch@coinshares.co.uk; w.distaso@imperial.ac.uk; wjk@doc.ic.ac.uk","","Distaso, Walter/0000-0002-4122-0160","CoinShares; Elwood Capital Management","CoinShares; Elwood Capital Management","Imperial College of London gratefully acknowledges the support given mutually by CoinShares and Elwood Capital Management.

The framework facilitates distribution via peer-to-peer delivery networks and incentivizes the distribution operation. The peer-to-peer delivery network reduces load by delegating the patch distribution to the nodes of the network, thereby protecting against a single point of failure and reducing costs. Distributed file-sharing solutions currently available in the literature are limited to sharing popular files among peers. In contrast, the proposed protocol incentivizes peers to distribute patch updates, which might be relevant only to IoT devices, using a blockchain-based lightning network. A manufacturer/owner named vendor of the IoT device commits a bid on the blockchain, which can be publicly verified by the members of the network. The nodes, called distributors, interested in delivering the patch update, compete among each other to exchange a piece of patch update with cryptocurrency payment. The pay-per-piece payments protocol addresses the problem of misbehavior between IoT devices and distributors as either of them may try to take advantage of the other. The pay-per-piece protocol is a form of a gradual release of a commodity like a patch update, where the commodity can be divided into small pieces and exchanged between the sender and the receiver building trust at each step as the transactions progress into rounds. The permissionless nature of the framework enables the proposal to scale as it incentivizes the participation of individual distributors. Thus, compared to the previous solutions, the proposed framework can scale better without any overhead and with reduced costs. A combination of the Bitcoin lightning network for cryptocurrency incentives with the BitTorrent delivery network is used to present a prototype of the proposed framework. Finally, a financial and scalability evaluation of the proposed framework is presented.","[Tapas, Nachiket; Longo, Francesco; Puliafito, Antonio] Univ Messina, Dipartimento Ingn, I-98166 Messina, Italy; [Yitzchak, Yechiav; Shabtai, Asaf] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Software & Informat Syst Engn, IL-84105653 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Puliafito, Antonio] CINI Natl Interuniv Consortium Informat, Via Ariosto 25, I-00185 Rome, Italy","University of Messina; Ben Gurion University","Tapas, N (corresponding author), Univ Messina, Dipartimento Ingn, I-98166 Messina, Italy.","ntapas@unime.it; yechiavil@gmail.com; flongo@unime.it; apuliafito@unime.it; shabtaia@bgu.ac.il","Tapas, Nachiket/S-3711-2019","Puliafito, Antonio/0000-0003-0385-2711; Tapas, Nachiket/0000-0002-7860-8572","","","","","54","1","1","1","2","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1424-8220","","SENSORS-BASEL","Sensors","APR","2020","20","7","","","","","","","2156","10.3390/s20072156","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s20072156","","","26","Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation","LT5KW","32290331","Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000537110500352","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We find that the return spillovers differ across both periods for the Bitcoin-Ethereum, Bitcoin-Litecoin, and Ethereum-Litecoin pairs. The volatility transmission is not significant between cryptocurrencies during the pre-COVID-19 period. We also find that the volatility spillover is unidirectional from Bitcoin to Ethereum and bidirectional between Ethereum and Litecoin during the COVID-19 period. Moreover, volatility transmission is not significant between Bitcoin and Litecoin during the COVID-19 period. The dynamic conditional correlations between all pairs of cryptocurrencies are higher during the COVID-19 period than during the pre-COVID-19 period. Lastly, we compute the optimal portfolio weights, time-varying hedge ratios, and hedging effectiveness for all pairs of cryptocurrencies during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. Overall, our findings provide new insights into channels of information transmission, which may improve the investment decisions and trading strategies of portfolio investors during crisis and non-crisis periods.

Bitcoin mining is done through proof of work (PoW). Given its characteristics, the higher hash rate results in a higher probability of mining, leading to the emergence of a mining pool, called a mining organization. Unlike central processing units or graphics processing units, high-cost application-specific integrated circuit miners have emerged with performance efficiency. The problem is that the obtained hash rate exposes Bitcoin's mining monopoly and causes the risk of a double-payment attack. To solve this problem, we propose the error-correction code PoW (ECCPoW), combining the low-density parity-check decoder and hash function. The ECCPoW contributes to the phenomenon of symmetry in the proof of work (PoW) blockchain. This paper proposes the implementation of ECCPoW, replacing the PoW in Bitcoin. Finally, we compare the mining centralization, security, and scalability of ECCPoW and Bitcoin.","[Jung, Hyunjun] Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Blockchain Internet Econ Res Ctr, Gwangju 61005, South Korea; [Lee, Heung-No] Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Gwangju 61005, South Korea","Gwangju Institute of Science & Technology (GIST); Gwangju Institute of Science & Technology (GIST)","Lee, HN (corresponding author), Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Gwangju 61005, South Korea.","junghj85@gist.ac.kr; heungno@gist.ac.kr","Lee, Heung-No/CSV-9346-2022","Jung, Hyunjun/0000-0002-6717-1395","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIP) [NRF-2018R1A2A1A19018665]","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIP)","This work was supported in part by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Korean government (MSIP) (NRF-2018R1A2A1A19018665).","","17","3","3","4","7","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2073-8994","","SYMMETRY-BASEL","Symmetry-Basel","JUN","2020","12","6","","","","","","","988","10.3390/sym12060988","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12060988","","","20","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","MN4TO","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000550836200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of multiscale interdependencies among five leading and liquid cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash) using wavelet-based analyses that account for the heterogeneous behaviour of crypto-traders and crypto-investors. The results provide evidence of high levels of dependency from 2016 to 2018 at daily frequency scales. The cross wavelet transforms demonstrate Ripple and Ethereum to be trivial origins of market contagion. The results of wavelet coherence confirm the short-run and long-run market integration among some cryptocurrency pairs. However, the coherence is found to fluctuate at higher frequencies and be significantly stable at lower frequencies. Furthermore, the switch in the lead and lag relations of cryptocurrency returns suggests alternating time and frequency interdependencies. Our findings are useful to scale-conscious traders and multi-prospect (various investment horizon) investors and portfolio managers. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We analyse the daily price of: the Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500), the Russell 2000 Index (RUT), Bitcoin and the gold spot price in USD. The study covers a period of 5 years: 2013-2018. According to the results, the prices of different assets react differently to changes in the level of investor attention (and vice versa), and this relationship changes over time. Bitcoin seems to be the most sensitive to the changes in investor attention and changes in its dynamics appear to influence investor attention the most. Changes in the volatility and trade volume of stocks occur simultaneously with changes in investor interest. However, during periods of increased stock volatility, we can observe increased investor interest in gold over any other asset. The price of gold itself has proven itself to be most immune to changes in investor attention.","[Rutkowska, Aleksandra; Kliber, Agata] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Appl Math, Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland","Poznan University of Economics & Business","Rutkowska, A (corresponding author), Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Appl Math, Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland.","aleksandra.rutkowska@ue.poznan.pl; agata.kliber@ue.poznan.pl","","Kliber, Agata/0000-0003-1996-5550; Rutkowska, Aleksandra/0000-0002-2111-7764","","","","","52","0","0","3","15","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1435-246X","1613-9178","","CENT EUR J OPER RES","Cent.

Under the high volatility financial situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic occurrence, there exist a computation difficulty to use the traditional DCC method to the selected cryptocurrencies. To solve this limitation, GC-DCC and GCNA-DCC are applied to investigate the time-varying relationship among Bitcoin, Gold, and S&P 500. In terms of log-likelihood, we show that GC-DCC and GCNA-DCC are better models than DCC and NA-DCC to show relationship of Bitcoin with Gold and S&P 500. We also consider the relationships among time-varying conditional correlation with Bitcoin volatility, and S&P 500 volatility by a Gaussian Copula Marginal Regression (GCMR) model. The empirical findings show that S&P 500 and Gold price are statistically significant to Bitcoin in terms of log-return and volatility.","[Kim, Jong-Min] Univ Minnesota, Stat Discipline, Morris, MN 56267 USA; [Kim, Seong-Tae] North Carolina A&T State Univ, Dept Math, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA; [Kim, Sangjin] Dong A Univ, Dept Management & Informat Syst, Busan 49236, South Korea","University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Morris; University of North Carolina; North Carolina A&T State University; Dong A University","Kim, S (corresponding author), Dong A Univ, Dept Management & Informat Syst, Busan 49236, South Korea.","jongmink@morris.umn.edu; skim@ncat.edu; skim10@dau.ac.kr","","","Dong-A University, South Korea","Dong-A University, South Korea","This research was funded by Dong-A University, South Korea.","","31","8","8","0","16","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-7390","","MATHEMATICS-BASEL","Mathematics","NOV","2020","8","11","","","","","","","1859","10.3390/math8111859","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math8111859","","","15","Mathematics","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Mathematics","OX0RR","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000593283700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

While the proof-of-work consensus protocol is the most energy-consuming protocol, proof-of-stake and the hybrid of these two consensus protocols, which consume considerably less energy, have also been introduced. We employ portfolio analysis to explore whether energy is a fundamental economic factor affecting cryptocurrency prices. Surprisingly, our results suggest that, on average, cryptocurrencies employing proof-of-work consensus protocols do not generate returns that are significantly different from those that incorporate proof-of-stake consensus protocols. Even more surprising is that our results show that cryptocurrencies that incorporate the hybrid version of these consensus protocols generate significantly higher average returns than the other groups. A possible explanation for this phenomenon may be that the cryptocurrency market is still driven by the trust factor rather than the energy factor.","[Sapkota, Niranjan; Grobys, Klaus] Univ Vaasa, Dept Accounting & Finance, Wolffintie 34, Vaasa 65200, Finland","University of Vaasa","Sapkota, N (corresponding author), Univ Vaasa, Dept Accounting & Finance, Wolffintie 34, Vaasa 65200, Finland.","niranjan.sapkota@uva.fi; klaus.grobys@uva.fi","","","","","","","36","2","2","2","18","INCISIVE MEDIA","LONDON","HAYMARKET HOUSE, 28-29 HAYMARKET, LONDON, SW1Y 4RX, ENGLAND","1756-3607","1756-3615","","J ENERGY MARKETS","J.

We show that volatility and returns on investment in a single cryptocurrency or a portfolio of cryptoassets are nearly halved when stop-loss rules are in place. Moreover, our analysis shows that the survival rate of long positions in cryptocurrencies does not exceed 35%. We conclude that the application of stop-loss rules may help in managing the risk of investment in cryptoassets.

Two contributions of the proposed DLI are to reveal the Granger causality between the bitcoin price and S&P index and to forecast the bitcoin price and S&P index with a higher accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that there is a bidirectional but asymmetric Granger causality between the bitcoin price and S&P index. And the DLI performs a superior prediction accuracy by integrating variables that have causalities with the target variable into the prediction process.","[Peng, Wei] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Qingdao 266590, Peoples R China","Shandong University of Science & Technology","Peng, W (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Qingdao 266590, Peoples R China.","pengweisd@foxmail.com","","Peng, Wei/0000-0002-1238-6604","National Natural Science Foundation of China [11801060]; Innovation Program of Shandong University of Science and Technology [SDKDYC190114]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Innovation Program of Shandong University of Science and Technology","The author acknowledges the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 11801060) and the Innovation Program of Shandong University of Science and Technology (no.

Despite the broad adoption by enthusiasts, the consensus mechanism is vulnerable to certain issues, such as block withholding attack, selfish mining, and 51% attack. Various solutions have been proposed to address these problems. RepuCoin is one successful example, which claims to solve the selfish mining and 51% attack by adopting a novel reputation concept and modified BFT protocol. We generalize the reputation concept introduced in RepuCoin, and implement it in traditional Bitcoin system to analyze whether it can prevent the block withholding attack. We propose a reputation-based reward mechanism for the Bitcoin blockchain and a reward sharing schema for the mining pools. We model the utility of honest mining and block withholding attack for pools, and find that the inclusion of reputation in Bitcoin's reward mechanism and pools' reward schema can prevent mining pools from launching block withholding attack.","[Yu, Lianyang; Yu, Jiangshan] Monash Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Zolotavkin, Yevhen] Deakin Univ, Ctr Cyber Secur Res & Innovat, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Zolotavkin, Yevhen] Cyber Secur Cooperat Res Ctr, Joondalup, Australia","Monash University; Deakin University","Yu, LY (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Clayton, Vic, Australia.","lyuu0014@student.monash.edu; jiangshan.yu@monash.edu; yevhen.zolotavkin@deakin.edu.au","","","Cyber Security Research Centre Limited - Australian Government's Cooperative Research Centres Programme","Cyber Security Research Centre Limited - Australian Government's Cooperative Research Centres Programme","The work has been partially supported by the Cyber Security Research Centre Limited whose activities are partially funded by the Australian Government's Cooperative Research Centres Programme.","","25","2","2","3","3","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-65745-1; 978-3-030-65744-4","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2020","12570","","","","","","149","166","","10.1007/978-3-030-65745-1_9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-65745-1_9","","","18","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Mathematics","BS4ZO","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000724564500009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Using daily data from 2017 to 2020, we employ tail dependence as copulas and the Generalized Forecast Error Variance Decomposition to examine the volatility connectedness. Our results suggest that, first, portfolios consisting of these assets exhibit heavy-tail dependence which implies that in the times of economic turbulence, there will be a high probability of large joint losses. Second, volatility transmission is higher in the short term, implying that short-term shocks can cause higher volatility in the assets, but in the long run, volatility transmission decreases. Third, Bitcoin and gold are vital assets for hedging, though the Bitcoin is also affected by its past volatility, a feature it shares with green bonds and NASDAQ AI. During economic downturns, gold may act as a safe haven, as its shock transmission to NASDAQ AI is just around 1.41%. Lastly, the total volatility transmission of all financial assets is considerably high, suggesting that the portfolio has an inherent self-transmitting risk which requires careful diversification.

We evaluate the performance of the estimations using a rollingwindow backtesting technique. Our results highlight the importance of estimating the ES of Bitcoin using a generalized GARCH model and a non-normal error distribution with at least two parameters.

In order to attract more hash computing power, the miner who finds the proper block can obtain some rewards. Actually, these hash calculations ensure that the data of the blockchain is not easily tampered. Thus, the incentive mechanism for mining affects the security of the blockchain directly. This paper presents an approach to attack against the difficulty adjustment algorithm (abbreviated as DAA) used in blockchain mining, which has a direct impact on miners' earnings. In this method, the attack miner jumps between different blockchains to get more benefits than the honest miner who keep mining on only one blockchain. We build a probabilistic model to simulate the time to obtain the next block at different hash computing power called hashrate. Based on this model, we analyze the DAAs of the major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Zcash, and Bitcoin Gold. We further verify the effectiveness of this attack called jumping mining through simulation experiments, and also get the characters for the attack in the public block data of Bitcoin Gold. Finally, we give an improved DAA scheme against this attack. Extensive experiments are provided to support the efficiency of our designed scheme.","[Hu, Muchuang] Peoples Bank China Guangzhou, Dept Sci & Technol, Guangzhou 510120, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jiahui] Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Comp, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China; [Gan, Wensheng] Jinan Univ, Coll Cyber Secur, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Chen, Chien-Ming] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Qingdao 266590, Peoples R China","People's Bank of China; Guangdong University of Technology; Jinan University; Shandong University of Science & Technology","Gan, WS (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Coll Cyber Secur, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.","moonchallenge@gmail.com; csjhchen@gmail.com; wsgan01@gmail.com; chienmingchen@ieee.org","Chen, Chien-Ming/W-2133-2019","Chen, Chien-Ming/0000-0002-6502-472X","","","","","23","2","2","1","14","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0924-669X","1573-7497","","APPL INTELL","Appl.

In this study, we compare the financial properties of these new digital assets and investigate their dynamic relationship with major financial securities and commodities. Furthermore, we evaluate the economic and financial potential benefits of cryptocurrencies for financial investors. Using different time-varying copula approaches and bivariate dynamic conditional correlation GARCH models, we find that the cross-correlation with conventional assets is changing over time but weak, supporting the idea that these cryptocurrencies can be suitable for financial diversification. However, our analysis of portfolios shows that cryptocurrencies are poor hedging instruments in most of the considered cases. Moreover, we find that the relationship between cryptocurrencies and conventional assets is sensitive to external economic and financial shocks.","[Charfeddine, Lanouar; Benlagha, Noureddine; Maouchi, Youcef] Qatar Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Finance & Econ, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar","Qatar University","Charfeddine, L (corresponding author), Qatar Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Finance & Econ, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar.","lcharfeddine@qu.edu.qa; nbenlagha@qu.edu.qa; ymaouchi@qu.edu.qa","Charfeddine, Lanouar/F-2781-2014; Benlagha, Noureddine/L-4292-2019; benlagha, Noureddine/AAL-1414-2020","Charfeddine, Lanouar/0000-0003-4324-6644; Benlagha, Noureddine/0000-0001-6831-483X; Maouchi, Youcef/0000-0003-0772-7870","","","","","63","69","71","3","33","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0264-9993","1873-6122","","ECON MODEL","Econ.

Many PoW coins do not have sufficient hashing power to secure itself. There are many alternatives to PoW, such as Proof of Stake (PoS), merge-mining etcetera, which uses much less electricity. However, these alternatives have some drawbacks either in terms of security, complexity, and scalability. In this paper, an alternative to Proof of Work (PoW) called Proof of BID (PoB) protocol introduced. PoB makes use of existing bitcoin PoW to secure all transactions, thus consuming virtually no electricity. PoB also addresses most of the drawbacks faced by PoW alternatives. We have disclosed a systematic method on how to effectively re-used bitcoin PoW to secure a blockchain with the same level of bitcoin security. A few designs issue to improve the blockchain scalability is given.

In this paper we identify three such properties, and then construct a blockchain protocol whose security can be reduced to them in the standard model assuming a common reference string (CRS). The three properties are: collision resistance, computational randomness extraction and iterated hardness. While the first two properties have been extensively studied, iterated hardness has been empirically stress-tested since the rise of Bitcoin; in fact, as we demonstrate in this paper, any attack against it (assuming the other two properties hold) results in an attack against Bitcoin. In addition, iterated hardness puts forth a new class of search problems which we term iterated search problems (ISP).

When put differently, the rational parties, who manage to maximize their utilities, involved in blockchain chose their strategies according to the economic incentives. Consequently, we focus on the influence of rational parties with respect to building blocks.

Evidence of significant symmetric dependence between return-volume is not found due to insignificance of student-t and Frank copula parameters. In a return-volume relationship, coefficients of lower tail dependence are significant for Bitcoin, Ripple, and Litecoin which means that low returns are followed by low volumes. Lower tail dependence for the return-volume relationship is stronger than the upper tail dependence for Bitcoin, Ripple, and Litecoin. Moreover, for negative return-volume, left tail dependence coefficients are significant for Ripple and Litecoin, which means that high returns are followed by low volumes for Ripple and Litecoin.

The result is a diverse ecosystem, as exemplified by the development of a wide range of different blockchain protocols. This raises questions for decision and policy makers: How do different protocols compare? What are their tradeoffs? Existing efforts to survey the area reveal a fragmented terminology and the lack of a unified framework to reason about the properties of blockchain protocols. In this article, we work toward bridging this gap. We present a five-dimensional design space with a modular structure in which protocols can be compared and understood. Based on these five axes-optimality, stability, efficiency, robustness, and persistence-we organize the properties of existing protocols in subcategories of increasing granularity. The result is a dynamic scheme-termed the PREStO framework-which aids the interaction between stakeholders of different backgrounds, including managers and investors, and which enables systematic reasoning about blockchain protocols. We illustrate its value by comparing existing protocols and identifying research challenges, hence making a first step toward understanding the blockchain ecosystem through a more comprehensive lens.","[Leonardos, Stefanos; Reijsbergen, Daniel; Piliouras, Georgios] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Singapore 487372, Singapore","Singapore University of Technology & Design","Leonardos, S (corresponding author), Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Singapore 487372, Singapore.","stefanos_leonardos@sutd.edu.sg; daniel_reijsbergen@sutd.edu.sg; georgios@sutd.edu.sg","","Leonardos, Stefanos/0000-0002-1498-1490","National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, under its National Cybersecurity RD Program [NRF2016NCR-NCR002-028]; SUTD Grant [SRG ESD 2015 097]; MOE AcRF Tier 2 Grant [2016-T2-1-170]; NRF 2018 Fellowship [NRF-NRFF2018-07]","National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, under its National Cybersecurity RD Program; SUTD Grant(Singapore University of Technology & Design); MOE AcRF Tier 2 Grant; NRF 2018 Fellowship","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, under its National Cybersecurity R&D Program under Award NRF2016NCR-NCR002-028 and administered by the National Cybersecurity R&D Directorate.

The most popular systems currently employ a Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm as a means of creating these blocks. An unfortunate limitation of all deployed PoW blockchain systems is that the time between blocks has high variance. For example, Bitcoin produces, on average, one block every 10 minutes. However, 5% of the time, Bitcoin's inter-block time is at least 30 minutes. In this paper, we show that high variance is at the root of fundamental attacks on PoW blockchains. We propose an alternative process for PoW-based block discovery that results in an inter-block time with significantly lower variance. Our algorithm, called Bobtail, generalizes the current algorithm, which uses a single PoW sample, to one that incorporates k samples. We show that the variance of inter-block times decreases as k increases. Bobtail significantly thwarts doublespend and selfish mining attacks. For example, for Bitcoin and Ethereum, a doublespending attacker with 35% of the mining power will succeed with 44% probability when the merchant sets up an embargo of 1 block; however, when k >= 40, the probability of success for the same attacker falls to less than 1%. Similarly, for Bitcoin and Ethereum currently, a selfish miner with 45% of the mining power will claim about 71% of blocks; however, when k >= 20, the same miner will find that selfish mining is less successful than honest mining. We also investigate attacks newly made possible by Bobtail and show how they can be defeated. The primary costs of our approach are larger blocks and increased network traffic.","[Bissias, George; Levine, Brian N.] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst","Bissias, G (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.","gbiss@cs.umass.edu; brian@cs.umass.edu","","","","","","","37","2","2","1","4","INTERNET SOC","RESTON","1775 WIEHLE AVE, STE 201, RESTON, VA, UNITED STATES","","","978-1-891562-61-7","","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","10.14722/ndss.2020.23095","http://dx.doi.org/10.14722/ndss.2020.23095","","","16","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS0BE","","Bronze","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000680742600013","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Second, the decisions and expectations of forward-looking investors to buy virtual currency (thereby effectively regulating its supply). Third, the elements that jointly drive future consumer adoption and merchant acceptance of virtual currency. The model predicts that, as virtual currency becomes more established, the exchange rate will become less sensitive to the impact of shocks to speculators' beliefs. This undermines the notion that excessive exchange rate volatility will prohibit widespread use of virtual currency.","[Bolt, Wilko] De Nederlandsche Bank, Econ & Res Div, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bolt, Wilko] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Sch Business & Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Van Oordt, Maarten R.

Multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity family models provided evidence of significant positive dynamic conditional correlations among these markets. A weaker conditional correlation was observed for the LCT-XRP portfolio than for the BTC-ETH portfolio, which had the highest correlation value. The dynamic correlations intensified after the cryptocurrency crisis. The results of a portfolio risk analysis suggested that investors should hold less BTC than LTC, ETH, and XRP to minimize risk while maintaining consistent expected portfolio returns. Investors should hold less BTC than the other cryptocurrencies during a crisis. In addition, the cheapest hedge strategy is to hold long BTC and short XRP regardless of the period. Holding long BTC and short LTC was found to be the most expensive hedge strategy. Finally, the study showed that an optimally weighted diversified portfolio provides the greatest reduction in risk and downside risk for ETH and LTC.

Among these applications, decentralized payment systems (e.g. Bitcoin) have been one of the most mature blockchain applications with widespread adoption. While the early designs (e.g. Bitcoin) are often the currency of choice by cybercriminals (e.g., in ransomware incidents), they only provide pseudo-anonymity, in the sense that anyone can deanonymize Bitcoin transactions by using information in the blockchain. To strengthen the privacy protection of decentralized payment systems, a number of solutions such as Monero and Zerocash have been proposed. However, completely Decentralized Anonymous Payment (DAP) systems can be criminally exploited, for example in online extortion and money laundering activities. Recognizing the importance of regulation, we present a novel definition of Decentralized Conditional Anonymous Payment (DCAP) and describe the corresponding security requirements. In order to construct a concrete DCAP system, we first design a Condition Anonymous Payment (CAP) scheme (based on our proposed signature of knowledge), whose security can be demonstrated under the defined formal semantic and security models. To demonstrate utility, we compare the performance of our proposal with that of Zerocash under the same parameters and testing environment.","[Lin, Chao] Wuhan Univ, Key Lab Aerosp Informat Secur & Trusted Comp, Minist Educ, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Lin, Chao] State Key Lab Cryptol, Beijing 100878, Peoples R China; [He, Debiao] Wuhan Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [He, Debiao] Cyberspace Secur Res Ctr, Peng Cheng Lab, Shenzhen 518000, Peoples R China; [Huang, Xinyi] Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Math & Informat, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China; [Huang, Xinyi] Fujian Normal Univ, Fujian Prov Key Lab Network Secur & Cryptol, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China; [Khan, Muhammad Khurram] King Saud Univ, Ctr Excellence Informat Assurance CoEIA, Riyadh 11564, Saudi Arabia; [Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Informat Syst & Cyber Secur, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA","Wuhan University; Wuhan University; Peng Cheng Laboratory; Fujian Normal University; Fujian Normal University; King Saud University; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA)","He, DB (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.","linchao91@qq.com; hedebiao@163.com; xyhuang81@gmail.com; mkhurram@ksu.edu.sa; raymond.choo@fulbrightmail.org","Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond/A-3634-2009; Lin, Chao/GWZ-6351-2022; KHAN, MUHAMMAD KHURRAM/E-4836-2014; He, Debiao/F-6355-2011","Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond/0000-0001-9208-5336; Lin, Chao/0000-0002-0101-8531; KHAN, MUHAMMAD KHURRAM/0000-0001-6636-0533; He, Debiao/0000-0002-2446-7436","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0802500]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61972294, 61932016, 61822202, 61872089, 61972094]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Shenzhen [JCYJ20170818112550194]; King Saud University [RSP-2019/12]; Cloud Technology Endowed Professorship","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Planning Project of Shenzhen; King Saud University(King Saud University); Cloud Technology Endowed Professorship","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFB0802500, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61972294, Grant 61932016, Grant 61822202, Grant 61872089, and Grant 61972094, in part by the Science and Technology Planning Project of Shenzhen under Grant JCYJ20170818112550194, and in part by the Researchers Supporting Project of King Saud University under Grant RSP-2019/12.

However, the transparency and traceability of blockchain severely restrict the anonymity of participants in the real world, which will cause participants' privacy leakage. Toward this end, in this paper, an anonymous off-blockchain micropayments scheme (AOM) is proposed for cryptocurrencies in the real world. In AOM, a payee receives micropayments from an honest-but-curious intermediary ${\mathcal {T}}$ by solving puzzles which are generated based on the standard RSA assumption. Meanwhile, ${\mathcal {T}}$ also receives micropayments from the payers by payee's solutions and ${\mathcal {T}}$ will randomly select the inputs of the merging transaction ${T}_{\text {mer}}$ .

This paper identifies two traditions in monetary theory that have tried to answer that question. On the one hand, the money or non-money view follows a strategy proposed by a version of philosophical essentialism, in which there is a set of defining characteristics of money that make it categorically different from other things used in transactions. On the other hand, the liquidity degree view emphasizes that the multiple objects that circulate as a means of payment differ in their degree of acceptability. Since there is no absolute standard of liquidity, a precise dividing line between money and non-money cannot be drawn. We challenge the money or non-money view, arguing that there is nothing in the nature of money that can be interpreted as a natural kind essence by which money can be categorically separated from non-money.","[Frasser, Cristian] Univ Valle, Dept Econ, Cali, Colombia; Univ Tolima, Dept Econ & Finance, Ibague, Colombia","Universidad del Valle; Universidad del Tolima","Frasser, C (corresponding author), Univ Valle, Dept Econ, Cali, Colombia.","cristian.frasser@correounivalle.edu.co","","Frasser Lozano, Cristian Camilo/0000-0002-2784-9982","","","","","81","4","4","1","8","CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND","1744-1374","1744-1382","","J I ECON","J.

Bitcoin and other versions of it (known as Altcoins) are traded everyday at various cryptocurrency exchanges and have drawn the interest of many investors. These new types of assets are characterized by wild swings in prices, and this can lead to large swings in profit and losses. To respond to these dynamics, cryptoinvestors need adequate tools to guide them through their choice of portfolio selection and optimization. Bitcoin returns have shown some form of regime change, suggesting that regime-switching models could more adequately capture the volatility dynamics. This paper presents a two-state Markov-switching COGARCHR-vine (MSCOGARCH) model for cryptocurrency portfolio selection and compares the performance to the single-regime COGARCH-R-vine (COGARCH). The findings here are in line with the literature where MSCOGARCH outperforms the single-regime COGARCH with regard to the expected shortfall risk. The COGARCH specifications here capture the structural breaks and heavy tailness within each state of the Markov switching in order to achieve a minimal risk and a maximum return. The flexibility of R-vine copula allows adequate bivariate copula selection for each pair of cryptocurrencies to achieve suitable dependence structure through pair-copula construction architecture.","[Mba, Jules Clement] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Math & Appl Math, POB 524, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa; [Mwambi, Sutene] Univ Johannesburg, Sch Econ, POB 524, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa","University of Johannesburg; University of Johannesburg","Mba, JC (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Dept Math & Appl Math, POB 524, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa.","jmba@uj.ac.za; sutenem@uj.ac.za","Clement, Jules/AAE-3546-2021","Mba, Jules Clement/0000-0001-6462-6385","AAMP programme of the University of Johannesburg","AAMP programme of the University of Johannesburg","The authors are grateful to anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions, which led to significant improvement in the presentation and quality of this paper.

The existing researches on selfish min-ing analysis focused on Bitcoin, or ignored the blockchain details, or only investigated mining revenue without considering system performance and security. This paper aims to quantitatively evaluate the influence of selfish mining in an imperfect blockchain net-work from the perspective of honest miners (system performance and security) and selfish miners (selfish mining revenue ratio). We develop a novel Markov model to capture the behaviors of honest and selfish miners in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Our model can also capture natural forks (occurring due to block propagation delay) and the varying distance between uncle and nephew blocks in Ethereum. Formulas are derived to calculate mining revenue, system performance and security metrics. The proposed model and metric formulas are validated by (1) comparing our numerical with simulation results, and (2) compar-ing our numerical results with the existing work results. Numerical analysis is carried out to investigate selfish mining impact over diverse parameters. These quantitative results can help detect whether there are any selfish miners in the system, help design blockchain reward mechanisms and enhance security. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Ethereum's cryptocurrency, ether, is actively traded on centralized exchanges, second only to bitcoin. It has attracted investor's interest primarily because of its intrinsic value - small units of ether called 'gas' are used, essentially, as the fuel driving smart contract transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. We ask whether off-chain trading on ether derivatives plays a dominant role in ether spot price discovery, thereby driving ether's utility value for on-chain activity. Using minute-by-minute data we find that the ether perpetual swap on BitMEX, an unregulated cryptocurrency derivative exchange, has dominant trading volume and price discovery over the major spot exchanges. Furthermore, we identify interesting hour-of-day and day-of-week effects in trading volume on the spot exchanges, and these indicate that more informed institutional players are trading ether spot and derivatives.","[Alexander, Carol; Massie, Hamish R.

We use sentiment analysis to model the effects of public sentiment toward investment markets in general, and cryptocurrencies in particular on crypto assets' valuations. Our results show that investor sentiment can predict the price direction of cryptocurrencies, indicating direct impact of herding and anchoring biases.

The innovative and technological financial instruments are inspiring individuals and expert investors to investigate the broader investment spectrum, and consequently diversify their portfolios. Going beyond the conventional portfolios and developing state-of-the-art strategies that comply with the ever-changing financial and technological advancements are the keys to long term sustainability. Therefore, to cater to the needs of all segments of the society, the investment strategies during the fourth industrial revolution demand exposure to technological and digital financial innovations. This study investigates the impact of diversification with the addition of five cryptocurrencies from November 2015 to November 2019 on four traditional asset portfolios. The results show that the diversification increased the returns in most of the cases, and reduced the portfolio volatility in all portfolios, and also provided higher returns as compared to the traditional portfolios for the same level of risk. This study also revealed that the results might improve when short sales are allowed. Moreover, we can conclude that the addition of multiple cryptocurrencies in a portfolio provides enhanced results for diversification, and Ethereum provides a better diversification opportunity as compared to Bitcoin.","[Ma, Yechi] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 2555 Jingyue St, Changchun 130117, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Ahmad, Ferhana] Lahore Univ Management Sci, Suleman Dawood Sch Business, Lahore, Pakistan; [Liu, Miao] Jilin Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, 3699 Jingyue St, Changchun 130117, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zilong] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge, England","Northeast Normal University - China; Lahore University of Management Sciences; Jilin University of Finance & Economics; University of Cambridge","Liu, M (corresponding author), Jilin Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, 3699 Jingyue St, Changchun 130117, Jilin, Peoples R China.","mayc557@nenu.edu.cn; ferhana.ahmad@lums.edu.pk; liumiao@jlufe.edu.cn; zw325@cam.ac.uk","","","National Social Science Foundation [15CGJ021]","National Social Science Foundation","National Social Science Foundation (15CGJ021) Building of Silk Road Economic Belt and Promoting the RMB to Become a Globe Reserve currency.","","51","9","10","11","61","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","0040-1625","1873-5509","","TECHNOL FORECAST SOC","Technol.

We demonstrate that cryptocurrency traders (CTs) facilitate EPMs and demand liquidity even during the utmost EPMs. We observe the presence of herding behaviour during up markets across the entire dataset. Our robustness checks indicate that herding behaviour follows a dynamic pattern that varies over time with decreasing magnitude. We also provide novel evidence of CTs' profitability after transaction costs, and demonstrate their strong profitability-generating record in the future.","[Manahov, Viktor] Univ York, York YO10 5GD, N Yorkshire, England","University of York - UK","Manahov, V (corresponding author), Univ York, York YO10 5GD, N Yorkshire, England.","viktor.manahov@york.ac.uk","","","","","","","79","11","11","0","16","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1469-7688","1469-7696","","QUANT FINANC","Quant.

The rich applications and semantics of DApps inevitably introduce many security vulnerabilities, which have no counterparts in pure cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin. Since Ethereum is a new, yet complex, system, it is imperative to have a systematic and comprehensive understanding on its security from a holistic perspective, which was previously unavailable in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, the present survey, which can also be used as a tutorial, fills this void. We systematize three aspects of Ethereum systems security: vulnerabilities, attacks, and defenses.

At the same time, these two public blockchains differ strongly in the expressiveness of the smart contracts that they support. This is no coincidence. Ethereum chose the account model explicitly to facilitate more expressive smart contracts. On the other hand, Bitcoin chose UTXO also for good reasons, including that its semantic model stays simple in a complex concurrent and distributed computing environment. This raises the question of whether it is possible to have expressive smart contracts, while keeping the semantic simplicity of the UTXO model. In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively. We present Extended UTXO (EUTXO), an extension to Bitcoin's UTXO model that supports a substantially more expressive form of validation scripts, including scripts that implement general state machines and enforce invariants across entire transaction chains. To demonstrate the power of this model, we also introduce a form of state machines suitable for execution on a ledger, based on Mealy machines and called Constraint Emitting Machines (CEM). We formalise CEMs, show how to compile them to EUTXO, and show a weak bisimulation between the two systems. All of our work is formalised using the Agda proof assistant.","[Chakravarty, Manuel M.

In general, cryptocurrencies can be classified to as coins and tokens where the first can be thought of as a medium of exchange and the latter accounts for security or utility tokens depending upon its design. Design/methodology/approach Against this backdrop, this empirical study distinguishes, in particular, between pure coin and token portfolios. Both portfolios are optimized by maximizing the Sharpe ratio and, subsequently, compared with alternative portfolio strategies. Findings The empirical findings demonstrate that the maximum utility portfolio of coins, with a risk aversion of lambda = 10, outweighs alternative frameworks. The portfolios optimized by maximizing the Sharpe ratio for both coins and tokens indicate a rather poor performance. Testing the maximized utility for different levels of risk aversion confirms the findings of this empirical study and confers them more robustness. Research limitations/implications Further investigation is strongly recommended as tokens represent a new phenomenon in the cryptocurrency universe, for which only a limited amount of data are available, which restricts the sampling. Furthermore, future study is to include more sophisticated optimization models using different constraints in portfolio creation. Practical implications In light of the persistently substantial volatility in cryptocurrency markets, the empirical findings assert that portfolio managers are advised to construct a global minimum variance portfolio. In the absence of sophisticated optimization models, private investors can invest according to the market values of cryptocurrencies. Despite minor differences in the risk and reward ratios of the portfolios tested, tokens tend to be more speculative, especially, if the Tether token is excluded, which may require enhanced supervision and investor protection by regulating authorities. Originality/value As the current literature investigates on diversification effects of blended cryptocurrency portfolios rather than making an explicit distinction, this paper reflects one of the first to explore the investability and role of diversifying coins and tokens using a classic Markowitz approach.","[Schellinger, Benjamin] Augsburg Univ Appl Sci, Fac Business, Augsburg, Germany","","Schellinger, B (corresponding author), Augsburg Univ Appl Sci, Fac Business, Augsburg, Germany.","benjamin.schellinger@web.de","","Schellinger, Benjamin/0000-0003-1544-4133","Deutsche Bundesbank","Deutsche Bundesbank","This research work was funded by the Deutsche Bundesbank.

Even though these strategies have been shown to perform well for equities, their performance is unknown for the field of cryptocurrencies, usually perceived as inefficient and predictable. We apply the distance and cointegration methods to a basket of 26 liquid cryptocurrencies traded on the Binance exchange, specifically at 5-minute, 1-hour and daily frequencies. In our backtests, the strategies underperform classical benchmarks. However, the results are quite sensitive to parameter settings and external factors such as transaction costs or execution windows. Higher-frequency trading delivers significantly better performance, and while the most common daily distance method returns -0.07% monthly, this increases to 11.61% monthly for 5-minute frequency. Additionally, we find evidence of simple mean-reverting behavior in intraday prices that is missing in daily data, and which provides further support for the inefficiency of cryptocurrency markets.","[Fil, Miroslav; Kristoufek, Ladislav] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague 11000, Czech Republic","Charles University Prague","Kristoufek, L (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague 11000, Czech Republic.","lk@fsv.cuni.cz","Kristoufek, Ladislav/GOV-5386-2022","Kristoufek, Ladislav/0000-0003-4843-9373; Fil, Miroslav/0000-0002-5212-3876","Charles University PRIMUS program [PRIMUS/19/HUM/17]","Charles University PRIMUS program","This work was supported by the Charles University PRIMUS program is highly appreciated under Grant PRIMUS/19/HUM/17.","","66","8","8","0","9","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","172644","172651","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3024619","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3024619","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","NX7SY","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000575907300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The empirical results show that (1) the degree of market efficiency varies with time in the markets, (2) the degree of market efficiency varies with time, (2) Bitcoin's market efficiency level is higher than that of Ethereum over most periods, and (3) a market with high market liquidity has been evolving.

The impact of NVIX remains robust even after controlling for Global Economic Policy Uncertainty (GEPU) and Realized Volatility (RV). The uncertainty derived from investor perception is more important than the uncertainty of economic fundamentals in predicting cryptocurrency volatility. The hedging effectiveness of Bitcoin against the S&P 500 index is improved due to consideration of NVIX.

This consensus is introduced for permissioned (or private) blockchains and is designed for a user-centric personal data market. This market is subject to specific regulations with which conventional blockchains fail to comply. Proof of Usage aims to promote a new paradigm dedicated to usage incentivization, valuation, and control of user data in various sectors, such as banking and insurance. Other consensuses such as Proof of Stake or historical Proof of Work do not encourage coin spending and usage (in fact, Proof of Stake promotes the opposite). However, the value of the currency mainly depends on its use. This paper first introduces a contextualization of blockchain technology and decentralized consensus models. The motivation is then discussed for a new model of personal data exchange in a decentralized but supervised environment. The PoU protocol and its process flow are defined in detail. Furthermore, the paper explores two different approaches regarding the reward mechanism and the incentive model. Finally, the paper focuses on security requirements and how PoU meets such requirements in a permissioned-based blockchain system.","[Masseport, Samuel; Lartigau, Jorick] Pikcio SAS, Montpellier, France; [Masseport, Samuel; Darties, Benoit; Giroudeau, Rodolphe] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, LIRMM, Montpellier, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Universite de Montpellier","Masseport, S (corresponding author), Pikcio SAS, Montpellier, France.;Masseport, S (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, CNRS, LIRMM, Montpellier, France.","samuel.masseport@lirmm.fr; jorick.lartigau@pikcio.com; darties@lirmm.fr; rgirou@lirmm.fr","","","","","","","18","2","2","2","12","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0003-4347","1958-9395","","ANN TELECOMMUN","Ann.

Uncoordinated payment transfer in channel networks including path-based fund transfer may overuse few channels. This will lead to imbalanced channel networks where the channel balance of few channels is too low to remain operational. In this paper, we propose a coordination method for a landmarkbased routing algorithm for fund transfer in offline channels. Our procedure allows the landmarks to route funds in complementary and non-overlapping paths which balances channel values in a bi-directional channel network. Using experimental evaluation with Bitcoin Lightning network data we prove that the proposed coordinated landmark-based routing algorithm keeps a better balance of the channels and significantly improves the success rate of fund transfer compared with existing landmark-based routing algorithms.","[Thakur, Subhasis; Breslin, John G.] Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland","Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway","Thakur, S (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland.","subhasis.thakur@nuigalway.ie; john.breslin@nuigalway.ie","Breslin, John/B-7025-2015","Breslin, John/0000-0001-5790-050X","Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) [SFI/12/RC/2289 P2]; European Regional Development Fund; Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine on behalf of the Government of Ireland [16/RC/3835]","Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)(Science Foundation Ireland); European Regional Development Fund(European Commission); Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine on behalf of the Government of Ireland","This project is funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, under the Government of Ireland's Project 2040 Plan and Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) under Grant Number SFI/12/RC/2289 P2, co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund and Science Foundation Ireland (SFI).

These investiments are oriented by a simple principle: buy the currencies when their market value is about to rise, and sell them when their market value is about to drop. Several sources of information can be used to support the decision making process-such as news or comments in social networks on the topic itself. Nonetheless, to deal with the such a huge amount of information presents itself as a big challenge. The goal of this work is to develop a model that predicts the movement of cryptocurrencies' prices based on the public perception about the currencies.

Each trade is fast, because it happens off-blockchain, and secure, because atomic swaps prevent even a hacked exchange from taking custody of a trader's coins. Arwen is designed to work even with the lowest common denominator of blockchains-namely Bitcoin-derived coins without SegWit support.

Abnormal returns as well as cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) around major news announcements, both positive and negative, are investigated for three primary cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. High abnormal returns are observed on the event day (Day 0), and CARs typically diverge during event windows of (-3, 6) and (0, 6), indicating that the information is not fully reflected in prices immediately after the news events. The CARs that linger for six days after an event suggest that the information flow in the cryptocurrency market is visibly slow. The magnitudes of CARs are larger for negative events than for positive events, implying that the market reaction to negative events is stronger than to positive announcements.

This paper provides a comprehensive statistical analysis of the six most important crypto-currencies from the period 2015-2020. Using daily data we (1) showed that the returns present many of the stylized facts often observed for stock assets, (2) modeled the returns underlying distribution using a semi-parametric mixture model based on the extreme value theory, (3) showed that the returns are weakly autocorrelated and confirmed the presence of long memory as well as short memory in the GARCH volatility, (4) used an econometric approach to compute risk measures, such as the value-at-risk, the expected shortfall, and drawups, (5) found that the crypto-coins' price trajectories do not contain speculative bubbles and that they move together maintaining the long run equilibrium, and (6) using static and dynamic D-vine pair-copula models, assessed the true dependence structure among the crypto-assets, obtaining robust copula based bivariate dynamic measures of association. The analyses indicate that the strength of dependence among the crypto-currencies has increased over the recent years in the cointegrated crypto-market. The conclusions reached will help investors to manage risk while identifying opportunities for alternative diversified and profitable investments. To complete the analysis we provide a brief discussion on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the crypto-market by including the first semester of 2020 data.","[de Melo Mendes, Beatriz Vaz] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Posgrad & Pesquisa Adm, IM COPPEAD Inst Math, BR-21941901 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Carneiro, Andre Fluminense] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, COPPEAD Inst Posgrad & Pesquisa Adm, BR-21941901 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro","Mendes, BVD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Posgrad & Pesquisa Adm, IM COPPEAD Inst Math, BR-21941901 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.","beatriz@im.ufrj.br; andrecarneiro@id.uff.br","","Mendes, Beatriz Vaz de Melo/0000-0002-2168-9746","Brazilian government agency CAPES","Brazilian government agency CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES))","The second author was partially supported by the Brazilian government agency CAPES.","","61","2","2","2","14","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

Since dark web marketplaces are unregulated, they do not offer any user protection, so police raids and scams regularly cause large losses to marketplace participants. However, the uncertainty has not prevented the proliferation of dark web marketplaces. Here, we investigate how the dark web marketplace ecosystem reorganises itself following marketplace closures. We analyse 24 separate episodes of unexpected marketplace closure by inspecting 133 million Bitcoin transactions among 38 million users. We focus on migrating users who move their trading activity to a different marketplace after a closure. We find that most migrating users continue their trading activity on a single coexisting marketplace, typically the one with the highest trading volume. User migration is swift and trading volumes of migrating users recover quickly. Thus, although individual marketplaces might appear fragile, coordinated user migration guarantees overall systemic resilience.","[ElBahrawy, Abeer; Baronchelli, Andrea] City Univ London, Dept Math, London EC1V 0HB, England; [ElBahrawy, Abeer; Rusnac, Leonid; Goldsmith, Daniel] Chainalysis Inc, New York, NY USA; [Alessandretti, Laura] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Alessandretti, Laura] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen Ctr Social Data Sci, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Teytelboym, Alexander] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England; [Baronchelli, Andrea] UCL, UCL Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England; [Baronchelli, Andrea] British Lib, Alan Turing Inst, 96 Euston Rd, London NW12DB, England","City University London; Technical University of Denmark; University of Copenhagen; University of Oxford; University of London; University College London","Baronchelli, A (corresponding author), City Univ London, Dept Math, London EC1V 0HB, England.;Baronchelli, A (corresponding author), UCL, UCL Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England.;Baronchelli, A (corresponding author), British Lib, Alan Turing Inst, 96 Euston Rd, London NW12DB, England.","Andrea.Baronchelli.1@city.ac.uk","Baronchelli, Andrea/F-9550-2016","Baronchelli, Andrea/0000-0002-0255-0829; Rusnac, Leonid/0000-0002-4255-1455; Alessandretti, Laura/0000-0001-6003-1165","ESRC as part of UK Research and Innovation's rapid response to COVID-19 [ES/V00400X/1]; ESRC [ES/V00400X/1] Funding Source: UKRI","ESRC as part of UK Research and Innovation's rapid response to COVID-19; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","A.B. and A.T. were supported by ESRC as part of UK Research and Innovation's rapid response to COVID-19, through grant ES/V00400X/1.","","33","9","9","3","8","NATURE PORTFOLIO","BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","2045-2322","","","SCI REP-UK","Sci Rep","NOV 2","2020","10","1","","","","","","","18827","10.1038/s41598-020-74416-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74416-y","","","8","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","OR6ZT","33139743","Green Published, gold, Green Submitted, Green Accepted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000589617900006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Network analysis also uncovered twenty types of legal and antisocial entities operating on bitcoin and provided a path for uncovering these antisocial entities. However, earlier works of literature have focused on limited aspects of a typical supply chain such as monitoring assets, securing traceability, data integrity negligence, and data access. To overcome such drawbacks, this article proposes permissioned Blockchain with relevant processes and functions to obtain a holistic framework for securing the supply chain and logistic operations. The efficacy of the proposed framework was demonstrated in the case study. Comparative study was performed with the existing frameworks where the proposed framework was found to be better at four counts compared on the basis of data integrity in supply chain, decentralized decision making and traceability. It was found that critical loopholes in a current supply chain can be overcome using the proposed framework.","[Kumar, Ajay; Abhishek, Kumar] NIT Patna, Dept CSE, Patna, Bihar, India; [Ghalib, Muhammad Rukunuddin; Kumar, Ananda S.] Vellore Inst Technol VIT, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Nerurkar, Pranav] NMIMS, MPSTME, Dept Data Sci, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Nerurkar, Pranav; Bhirud, Sunil] VJTI Mumbai, Dept CE & IT, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Alnumay, Waleed] King Saud Univ, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Chatterjee, Pushpita] Old Dominion Univ, Norfolk, VA USA; [Ghosh, Uttam] Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA","National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Patna; Vellore Institute of Technology; SVKM's NMIMS (Deemed to be University); Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI); King Saud University; Old Dominion University; Vanderbilt University","Kumar, A (corresponding author), NIT Patna, Dept CSE, Patna, Bihar, India.","ajayk.phd18.cs@nitp.ac.in","CHATTERJEE, PUSPITA/AAR-3862-2020; Abhishek, Kumar/C-9914-2017; Alnumay, Waleed/AAP-1781-2021; Ghosh, Uttam/CAF-9098-2022; Ghalib, Muhammad Rukunuddin/C-4485-2019","CHATTERJEE, PUSPITA/0000-0002-0775-5540; Abhishek, Kumar/0000-0001-6825-2392; Ghosh, Uttam/0000-0003-1698-8888; Ghalib, Muhammad Rukunuddin/0000-0002-2786-3370; Alnumay, Waleed/0000-0001-5076-2060; nerurkar, pranav/0000-0002-9100-6437; kumar, Ajay/0000-0001-6712-6490","Raman Charpak Fellowship of the Indo-French Centre for the Promotion of Advanced Research [IFC/4132/RCF 2019/716]; King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [RSP-2020/250]","Raman Charpak Fellowship of the Indo-French Centre for the Promotion of Advanced Research; King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University)","The authors thank Blockchain Lab, VJTI Mumbai, and SRCD Department, IMT Atlantique, France, for providing the lab resources.

However, by interacting with the Bisq DAO, participants necessarily publish data to the Bitcoin blockchain and broadcast additional data to the Bisq peer-to-peer network. We examine the privacy cost to participants in sharing this data. Specifically, we use a novel address clustering heuristic to construct the one-to-many mappings from participants to addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain and augment the address clusters with data stored within the Bisq peer-to-peer network. We show that this technique aggregates activity performed by each participant: trading, voting, transfers, etc. We identify instances where participants are operating under multiple aliases, some of which are real-world names. We identify the dominant transactors and their role in a two-sided market. We conclude with suggestions to better protect the privacy of participants in the future.","[Hickey, Liam; Harrigan, Martin] Inst Technol, Dept Comp, Carlow, Ireland","South East Technological University (SETU)","Hickey, L (corresponding author), Inst Technol, Dept Comp, Carlow, Ireland.","liam.hickey@itcarlow.ie; martin.harrigan@itcarlow.ie","","Harrigan, Martin/0000-0002-6069-7001","","","","","23","0","0","1","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1530-1346","","978-1-7281-8086-1","IEEE SYMP COMP COMMU","","","2020","","","","","","","949","954","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BR4RM","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000652570900150","View Full Record in Web of Science"

For each block, the underlying distributed Proof of Work consensus where much computing power (named miners) is required to solve a hard mathematical problem, rewards the first one solving and sharing the solution with the rest of the network. Two main issues regarding this consensus can be easily pointed out i.e. the computation power spend by miners is a waste since only one of them will be rewarded, and miners with much smaller computing capacity can almost never solve the mathematical problem, hence cannot earn any reward. This paper proposes a substantial amendment to the existing Bitcoin consensus by using the wasted computation to adjust the difficulty of each miner that did provide computation effort overtime. Therefore, anytime a miner justifies of its work toward the consensus hence the network, without reaching the solution, then its difficulty will decrease accordingly for next blocks.","[Masseport, Samuel; Lartigau, Jorick] Pikcio SAS, Montpellier, France; [Masseport, Samuel; Darties, Benoit; Giroudeau, Rodolphe] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, LIRMM, Montpellier, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Universite de Montpellier","Masseport, S (corresponding author), Pikcio SAS, Montpellier, France.;Masseport, S (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, CNRS, LIRMM, Montpellier, France.","samuel.masseport@pikcio.com; benoit.darties@lirmm.fr; rodolphe.giroudeau@lirmm.fr; jorick.lartigau@pikcio.com","","","","","","","9","1","1","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-7091-6","","","","2020","","","","","","","57","58","","","","","","2","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7IF","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000848737000013","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We then propose a method of adjusting the block interval that maintains fairness and high transaction throughput. The existing fairness measure is so rough that its judgement is considered fair as long as a node can start mining by the time another node mines a block. However, the time left for mining differs between nodes; this can result in unfairness. Therefore, we define the proposed fairness as the mining success rate of miners depends only on computational power. This is a finer measure of fairness than existing one. We propose a method for adjusting the block interval to maintain a certain level of fairness. Most Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains fix the block intervals and do not consider fairness. In contrast, our proposed technique adjusts the block interval based on the fork incidence rate. Our method maintains fairness even if the network conditions change.

In a nutshell, the return and trading volumes of the cryptocurrency markets are net information transmitters while the markets' volatility and the demand for electricity in the U.S., China, and Japan are net information receivers in the system.

In these supply contracts and expands and capital restrictions apply due to the existence of reserves as the exchange rate arrangement adheres to a price rule. Design/methodology/approach - Ever since the launch of Bitcoin and its offspring, examination of cryptocurrencies' trading activity from the empirical finance viewpoint has received much attention and continues to do so. The particular monetary arrangements found in Stable cryptocurrencies (colloquially referred to as Stablecoins), however, have not been properly (1) classified and (2) studied within an empirical international finance and banking context. This paper provides an empirical framework analogous to Impossible Trinity for exploring monetary arrangements across Stablecoins wherein reserves are held as price stability is targeted. Findings - The study findings of existence of the degree of achievement along the three dimensions of the Impossible Trinity hypothesis, namely monetary independence, exchange rate stability and financial openness for a representative sample able to cover all varieties of Stablecoins, provide fresh empirical insights and arguments to this growing literature with respect to the success of their embedded exchange rate stabilization mechanisms. While the hypothesis can be supported for all cryptocurrencies in question, the trade-off combination among exchange rate stability, capital openness and monetary independence varies with the categorical types of Stablecoins. Research limitations/implications - If Stable cryptocurrencies, therefore, claim the role of global monetary assets freed from sovereign limits and national boundaries, it is critical to explore whether they adhere to traditional monetary frameworks. It goes without saying that in this work the author does not use a complete catalogue of all the available Stablecoins, rather a complete catalogue of all the possible asset classes of Stablecoins. While there is a significant difficulty in finding Algorithmic Stablecoins and, so far, there is plethora of Stable Token initiatives, a broader sample to further examine these under this paper's empirical framework is suggested. Enrichment of the robustness analysis by constructing additional proxies, possibly building time series for the proposed cmo1 subindex and using additional estimation methods is encouraged. Practical implications - Stablecoins have been developed aiming to address the issue of excessive price variation in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Holders of Stablecoins enjoy the combined advantages of using a blockchain-based digital infrastructure in fulfilling the functions of store of value and media of exchange and of using a traditional currency, which merely plays the role of the unit of account (and in some circumstances the trusted reserve to which is convertible to). Understanding the varieties of Stablecoins and quantifying the components for success of their price stabilization may result in designing better Stablecoins. Social implications - Blockchain and cryptocurrencies have introduced new challenges to money and banking. Cryptocurrencies, which independently float such as Bitcoin, have gained the interest so far due to price variation that allows for gains. But these should be by far not considered to be a substitute to traditional means of payment. Lately, Stablecoins have increasingly gained attention for that USD Tether/Bitcoin pair (a Stablecoin pegged to the US dollar at parity) has outrun the US dollar/Bitcoin pair as the most traded pair in digital exchanges marking the strong position and high demand for Stablecoins. Originality/value - This approach uncovers the varieties of Stablecoins with respect to their monetary constraints compared to the rest of the cryptocurrencies, which independently float. In this paper, the author provides a conceptual framework for the analysis of the exchange rate mechanisms conditional on Stablecoin asset classes accompanied with an empirical study from the monetary viewpoint. This is the first work in this attempt. The empirical framework employed is analogous to the traditional theory of international monetary economics referred to as Impossible Trinityz.","[Koutsoupakis, Dimitrios] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Athens, Greece","National & Kapodistrian University of Athens","Koutsoupakis, D (corresponding author), Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Athens, Greece.","dimitrios.koutsoupakis@econ.uoa.gr","","Koutsoupakis, Dimitrios/0000-0002-7450-3992","","","","","26","2","2","5","22","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","0144-3585","","","J ECON STUD","","OCT 29","2021","48","8","","","","","1480","1496","","10.1108/JES-06-2020-0279","http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JES-06-2020-0279","","DEC 2020","17","Economics","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Business & Economics","WN7WE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000594839200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Towards this goal, we attribute attack viability in the attack surface to 1) the Blockchain cryptographic constructs, 2) the distributed architecture of the systems using Blockchain, and 3) the Blockchain application context. To each of those contributing factors, we outline several attacks, including selfish mining, the 51 attack, DNS attacks, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, consensus delay (due to selfish behavior or distributed denial-of-service attacks), Blockchain forks, orphaned and stale blocks, block ingestion, wallet thefts, smart contract attacks, and privacy attacks. We also explore the causal relationships between these attacks to demonstrate how various attack vectors are connected to one another.

It is widely assumed that the real-world identities of the persons who engage in cryptocurrency transactions are secret and will remain secret. Digital signatures serve as identities of the parties involved in cryptocurrency transactions. They are essentially composed of a pair of keys, the secret key and the public key, which are used for signing transactions. These keys are issued as many times as needed thus creating different identities for the same person. Since transactions are recorded with these pseudo names, it is thought that the real identities may not be linked to the transactions. Unlinkability has to be achieved for complete anonymity. However, recent studies show that real-life identities can be linked to addresses of these cryptocurrencies and transactions which use them. Therefore, it is safe to say that most cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous rather than anonymous. In this chapter, the problem with anonymity and its implications in accounting will be discussed. In addition to this, protocols and services, which make it harder or even impossible to link addresses and transactions to their senders and recipients, will be reviewed.","[Hazar, Hulya Boydas] Istanbul Aydin Univ, Dept Business Adm, Istanbul, Turkey","Istanbul Aydin University","Hazar, HB (corresponding author), Istanbul Aydin Univ, Dept Business Adm, Istanbul, Turkey.","hulyahazar@aydin.edu.tr","","","","","","","17","0","0","1","1","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","2364-5067","","978-3-030-53536-0; 978-3-030-53535-3","EURAS STUD BUS ECON","","","2020","14","1","","","","","171","178","","10.1007/978-3-030-53536-0_12","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-53536-0_12","","","8","Business; Business, Finance; Economics","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics","BT7UR","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000851231500012","View Full Record in Web of Science"

GPU- and FPGA-based clouds have already been deployed to accelerate compute-intensive workloads. ASIC-based clouds are a natural evolution as cloud services expand across the planet. ASIC Clouds are purpose-built datacenters comprised of large arrays of ASIC accelerators that optimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) of large, high-volume scale-out computations. On the surface, ASIC Clouds may seem improbable due to high NREs and ASIC inflexibility, but large-scale ASIC Clouds have already been deployed for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency system. This paper distills lessons from these Bitcoin ASIC Clouds and applies them to other large scale workloads such as YouTube-style video-transcoding and Deep Learning, showing superior TCO versus CPU and GPU. It derives Pareto-optimal ASIC Cloud servers based on accelerator properties, by jointly optimizing ASIC architecture, DRAM, motherboard, power delivery, cooling, and operating voltage. Finally, the authors examine the impact of ASIC NRE and when it makes sense to build an ASIC Cloud.","[Taylor, Michael Bedford; Vega, Luis; Davidson, Scott; Richmond, Dustin] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Khazraee, Moein; Magaki, Ikuo] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of California System; University of California San Diego","Taylor, MB (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.","prof.taylor@gmail.com; vegaluis@cs.washington.edu; mkhazrae@cs.ucsd.edu; ikuo.magaki@icloud.com; stdavids@uw.edu; dustinar@uw.edu","","Richmond, Dustin/0000-0002-4587-8947","JUMP ADA Center - SRC; STARnet CFAR center - SRC; DARPA","JUMP ADA Center - SRC; STARnet CFAR center - SRC; DARPA(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA))","This work was supported by both the JUMP ADA Center and the STARnet CFAR center, both funded by SRC and DARPA.

It brought a new paradigm that helps in the existence of the cryptocurrency and eliminating the third party in a financial transaction. It has the potential of optimising, enhancing streamlining many processes outside the cryptocurrency and financial sector but the adoption of the technology is limited by the hindering performance issues. These issues are mostly around the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol that is used by Bitcoin and Ethereum and referred to as the most secured and decentralised protocol thus, the most reliable. Unfortunately, the protocol suffers a performance degrade with the increasing size and number of transactions because of its complexity. Many industries, researchers and organisation have been working on addressing these issues but most of the attempts result in facing another issue referred to as the scalability issue; having to trade off one of security or decentralisation to get speed. Other solution such as Bitcoin lighting network improved the transaction throughput of the Bitcoin without technically addressing the issue on the blockchain, therefore, didn't face the scalability issue. This paper presents a research work of a novel approach that propose using machine learning techniques to improve the performance by enhancing the mining efficiency of the protocol. It uses the Ethereum network as a case study. The paper also aims to compare the predictive accuracy and speed of some machine learning regression models against the traditional mining method starting from the Linear regression. The objective is to determine whether using machine learning in the mining process offers a faster way of achieving consensus, therefore improving performance by reducing the time and energy consumption of the protocol without sacrificing security or decentralisation. The proposed model results in improved accuracy and faster consensus from the early experiments.","[Safana, Mujistapha Ahmed; Arafa, Yasmine; Ma, Jixin] Univ Greenwich, Sch Comp & Math Sci, London, England","University of Greenwich","Safana, MA (corresponding author), Univ Greenwich, Sch Comp & Math Sci, London, England.","Mujistapha.Ahmed@gre.ac.uk; Y.Arafa@greenwich.ac.uk; J.Ma@greenwich.ac.uk","","","","","","","34","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-8370-1","","","","2020","","","","","","","16","21","","10.1109/BCCA50787.2020.9274082","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BCCA50787.2020.9274082","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7IH","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000848747500003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

With the growth of chain, the height of blockchain in Bitcoin has reached five hundred thousand, and the entire capacity of chain is more than 500 GB. If a light node wants to verify a transaction, it has to spend nearly one week to download the data of whole chain with download rate of 1 MB/s, which seriously hinders the usage of blockchain. In order to resolve this problem, checkpoint is used to reduce the capacity of data, but this centralized scheme obviously violates the decentralization of blockchain. Other schemes are proposed will change the structure of blockchain may suffer the risk that adversary can fork a blockchain to cheat the light nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain architecture, which simplifies the verification in blockchain and is compatible with most consensus mechanism. We append backlinks in some blocks, such that blocks not only look like a chain but also like a binary tree.

Inspired by the success of Bitcoin, all types of alt cryptocurrencies were invented in recent years. Some of the new cryptocurrencies focus on privacy enhancement, where transaction information such as value and sender/receiver identity can be hidden, such as Zcash and Monero. However, there are few schemes to support multiple types of cryptocurrencies/assets and offer privacy enhancement at the same time. The major challenge for a multiple asset system is that it needs to support two-way assets exchange between participants besides one-way asset transfer. Thus, we propose a privacy-preserving exchange scheme, PrivateEx, which preserves the privacy of the exchange of different assets. PrivateEx utilizes zero-knowledge proof and a novel way to lock assets involved in the exchange to guarantee the correctness, fairness, and privacy of exchange of assets in the system. We also implement a prototype of PrivateEx and evaluate its performance to show that it is practical with modern computers.","[Xu, Lei; Fernandez, Miguel] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA; [Chen, Lin] Texas Tech Univ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Gao, Zhimin] Auburn Univ, Montgomery, AL 36117 USA; [Kasichainula, Keshav; Shi, Weidong] Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Carbunar, Bogdan] Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA","University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Auburn University System; Auburn University; University of Houston System; University of Houston; State University System of Florida; Florida International University","Xu, L (corresponding author), Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.","xuleimath@gmail.com; chenlin198662@gmail.com; mtion@msn.com; kkasicha@central.uh.edu; miguel.fernandez02@utrgv.edu; carbunar@cs.fiu.edu; wshi3@central.uh.edu","; Chen, Lin/N-4012-2018","Xu, Lei/0000-0002-7662-2119; Chen, Lin/0000-0003-3909-4916","NSF [1756014]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","The research was supported in part by NSF 1756014.","","18","0","0","3","5","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-6866-7","","","","2020","","","","","","","316","323","","10.1145/3341105.3373901","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3341105.3373901","","","8","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP9ND","","Bronze","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000569720900046","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The present article provides an overview of blockchain based e-voting systems. The primary purpose of this review is to study the up-to-date state of blockchain-based voting research along with associated possible challenges while aiming to forecast future directions. The methodology applied in the review is a systematic review approach. Following an introduction to the basic structure and features of the blockchain in relation to e-voting, we provide a conceptual description of the desired blockchain-based e-voting application. Symmetrical and asymmetrical cryptography improvements play a key role in developing blockchain systems. We have extracted and reviewed 63 research papers from scientific databases that have advised the adoption of the blockchain framework to voting systems. These articles indicate that blockchain-supported voting systems may provide different solutions than traditional e-voting. We classified the main prevailing issues into the five following categories: general, integrity, coin-based, privacy and consensus. As a result of this research, it was determined that blockchain systems can provide solutions to certain problems that prevail in current election systems. On the other hand, privacy protection and transaction speed are most frequently emphasized problems in blockchain applications. Security of remote participation and scalability should be improved for sustainable blockchain based e-voting. It was concluded that frameworks needed enhancements in order to be used in voting systems due to these reservations.","[Tas, Ruhi; Tanriover, Omer Ozgur] Ankara Univ, Comp Engn, TR-06830 Ankara, Turkey; [Tas, Ruhi] Turkish Radio Televis Corp, IT Dept, TR-06550 Ankara, Turkey","Ankara University","Tas, R (corresponding author), Ankara Univ, Comp Engn, TR-06830 Ankara, Turkey.;Tas, R (corresponding author), Turkish Radio Televis Corp, IT Dept, TR-06550 Ankara, Turkey.","ruhi.tas@trt.net.tr; ozgur.tanriover@ankara.edu.tr","Tanrıöver, Ö.

Furthermore, people are attracted by the concept of smart contract, i.e., a contract that is automatically executed by computer technology, without human intervention. Conclusions: The contribution of this paper is twofold: first of all, we introduce the four BlockChain platforms that are now most popular, discussing how they support the smart contract concept; second, we identify some typical categories of financial services, matching each of them with the platform that provides the best support for each category.","[Garcia Bringas, Pablo] Univ Deusto, Deusto Engn, Bilbao, Spain; [Pastor-Lopez, Iker] Univ Deusto, Fac Engn, Bilbao, Spain; [Psaila, Giuseppe] Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy","University of Deusto; University of Deusto; University of Bergamo","Bringas, PG (corresponding author), Univ Deusto, Deusto Engn, Bilbao, Spain.","pablo.garcia.bringas@deusto.es; iker.pastor@deusto.es; giuseppe.psaila@unibg.it","Garcia Bringas, Pablo/M-1399-2015","Garcia Bringas, Pablo/0000-0003-3594-9534","","","","","29","3","3","6","20","SCIENDO","WARSAW","BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND","1847-8344","1847-9375","","BUS SYST RES J","Bus.

Researchers have been actively working on analyzing and developing innovative defensive mechanisms to prevent these activities. A significant challenge facing researchers is collecting datasets to train defensive systems to detect and analyze these cyberattacks. Our aims in this systematic review are to explore and aggregate the state of the art threats that have emerged with cryptocurrencies and the defensive mechanisms that have been proposed. We also discuss the threats type, scale, and how efficient the defensive mechanisms are in providing early detection and prevention. We also list out the resources that have been used to collect datasets, and we identify the publicly available ones. In this study, we extracted 1,221 articles from four top scientific and engineering databases and libraries in Computer Science: IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Elsevier's Scopus, and Crarivate's Web of Science. We defined inclusion, exclusion, and quality of assessment criteria, and after a detailed review process, 66 publications were included in the final review. Our analysis revealed that the literature contains a significant amount of research to detect and analyze several attack types, such as the high yield investment programs and pump and dump. These attacks have been used to steal millions of USD, abuse millions of connected devices, and have created even more significant loss in denial of services and productivity losses. We have found that the researchers use various sources to collect training datasets. Many authors have made their dataset publicly available. We have created a list of these datasets, which we have made available along with other supplementary websites, tools, and libraries that can be used in the data collection and analysis process.","[Badawi, Emad; Jourdan, Guy-Vincent] Univ Ottawa, Fac Engn, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","University of Ottawa","Badawi, E (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Fac Engn, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.","ebada090@uottawa.ca","","Badawi, Emad/0000-0001-9336-8012","","","","","87","7","7","7","49","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","200021","200037","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3034816","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3034816","","","17","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","OR9LT","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000589787900001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Our scheme includes two parts: server and client. The server provides an immune configuration file and configuration file management functions, including a configuration file module, a cryptography algorithm module, and a display module. The client obtains the immunization configuration file from server in real time, and performs the corresponding operations according to the configuration file to make the computer have an immune function for a specific ransomware, including an update module, a configuration file module, a cryptography algorithm module, a control module, and a log module. This scheme controls mutexes, services, files and registries respectively, to destroy the triggering conditions of the virus and finally achieve the purpose of immunizing a computer from a specific ransomware.","[Song, Jingping; Meng, Qingyu; Xu, Jian] Northeastern Univ, Software Coll, Shenyang 110169, Peoples R China; [Luo, Chenke] Wuhan Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Naik, Nitin] Univ Portsmouth, Sch Comp, Portsmouth PO1 2DT, Hants, England","Northeastern University - China; Wuhan University; University of Portsmouth","Xu, J (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Software Coll, Shenyang 110169, Peoples R China.","xuj@mail.neu.edu.cn","","","","","","","16","0","0","4","15","TECH SCIENCE PRESS","HENDERSON","871 CORONADO CENTER DR, SUTE 200, HENDERSON, NV 89052 USA","1546-2218","1546-2226","","CMC-COMPUT MATER CON","CMC-Comput.

And while Poisson processes provide models for such data, they often lack the flexibility to cope with wide ranges of different behaviors. In this paper, we propose a clustering algorithm for temporal point process intensities that has this flexibility as we incorporate a fast spline interpolation method. We use a scalable kernel approach to handle local translation invariance and employ maximum entropy principles for model selection and outlier detection. This way, our framework allows us to uncover fine grained dynamical classes of behavior and we apply it to user answer time-stamps crawled from the question answering site StackOverflow, push events in the Github version control repository, and to transactions in the BitCoin network. Results indicate that on StackOverflow sites the user's classes are divided into bursty dynamics and into weekly dynamics with low replica activity. For the BitCoin data, we find patterns of growing activity reflecting economic bubble behavior. The Github data reveals patterns of concentrated and periodic activity.","[Ojeda, Cesar Ali Marin; Cvejoski, Kostadin; Sifa, Rafet; Schuecker, Jannis; Bauckhage, Christian] Fraunhofer Ctr Machine Learning, D-53757 St Augustin, Germany; Fraunhofer IAIS, D-53757 St Augustin, Germany","","Ojeda, CAM; Cvejoski, K; Sifa, R; Schuecker, J; Bauckhage, C (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Ctr Machine Learning, D-53757 St Augustin, Germany.","cesar.ali.ojeda.marin@iais.fraunhofer.de; kostadin.cvejoski@iais.fraunhofer.de; rafet.sifa@iais.fraunhofer.de; jannis.schuecker@iais.fraunhofer.de; christian.bauckhage@iais.fraunhofer.de","","","","","","","25","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","2194-5357","2194-5365","978-3-030-29516-5; 978-3-030-29515-8","ADV INTELL SYST COMP","","","2020","1037","","","","","","507","526","","10.1007/978-3-030-29516-5_40","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-29516-5_40","","","20","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR2DE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000637312900040","View Full Record in Web of Science"

For example, in the cryptocurrency systems, e.g., Bitcoin, some special nodes, called miners, compete with each other in diffusion races to acquire the system rewards. If the information for diffusion is large, pull-based dissemination is often used to alleviate the communication overhead, where a node notifies a small inventory message to its neighbor(s) before transferring the information itself. On receiving the inventory message, the neighboring node requests the corresponding information from the node. Since the information transfer may require much time due to temporal network/node trouble, the pull-based dissemination generally involves a timeout mechanism. If a timeout occurs, the node retries the information retrieval. A malicious node can conduct a delay attack on the information propagation by exploiting this timeout mechanism, i.e., temporarily interrupting the information transfer after receiving a request. In this paper, a risk of information diffusion with interruption is considered, under which adversaries colluding with a specific source node simultaneously conduct the delay attacks to slow down the information diffusion from competitive source nodes. With the help of the deterministic nonlinear model for the propagation of infectious diseases in mathematical epidemiology, a scalar standby-interrupted-retrieved attackable (SIRA) model is first developed, which captures the information diffusion with interruption under a well-mixed population. Furthermore, a network SIRA model is proposed by extending the scalar SIRA model to support the information diffusion with interruption over arbitrary networks. Through numerical evaluations, the risk of information diffusion with interruption is quantitatively revealed from the viewpoint of attack scale, attack rate, recovery rate, and network structure.","[Sasabe, Masahiro] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Div Informat Sci, 8916-5 Takayama Cho, Ikoma, Nara 6300192, Japan","Nara Institute of Science & Technology","Sasabe, M (corresponding author), Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Div Informat Sci, 8916-5 Takayama Cho, Ikoma, Nara 6300192, Japan.","m-sasabe@ieee.org","","Sasabe, Masahiro/0000-0002-1200-9112","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [19KT0045]","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI (C) under Grant 19KT0045, Japan.","","33","3","3","3","7","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1389-1286","1872-7069","","COMPUT NETW","Comput.

Blockchain architectures are still most commonly associated with currency applications, and with financial speculation. Bitcoin's rewards for Proof of Work mining became the default consensus technique for blockchains. As an alternative to reward mechanisms for blockchain maintenance, we propose punishment mechanisms for neglecting to maintain the blockchain (provided participants are intrinsically motivated to be beneficiaries of the blockchain application). Punishment not Reward is convincing for enterprise mission critical blockchain applications, and potential punishment mechanisms include denial of service and/or revocation of confidentiality. This obviates the need for reward via cryptocurrencies, along with their attendant volatility, insecure ecosystem, and market manipulation demerits. The privacy concerns of competing entities participating in a blockchain application are prima facie in conflict with the needs of the community to be able to inflict punishment mechanisms. Conflicts of this kind can be addressed via sophisticated cryptographic techniques such as secret sharing, multiparty computation, zero-knowledge proofs, and so on, which play a vital role. We stress the importance of correctly balancing all application specific interests in the engineering of blockchain applications, so that the mix of incentives and disincentives is stabilizing.","[Banach, Richard] Univ Manchester, Dept Comp Sci, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England","University of Manchester","Banach, R (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Dept Comp Sci, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.","richard.banach@manchester.ac.uk","","Banach, Richard/0000-0002-0243-9434","","","","","67","4","4","1","17","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1532-0626","1532-0634","","CONCURR COMP-PRACT E","Concurr.

Blockchain relies on solving difficult mathematical problems as proof-of-work within a network before blocks are added to the chain. Brute force approach, advocated by some as the fastest algorithm for solving partial hash collisions and implemented in Bitcoin blockchain, implies exhaustive, sequential search. It involves incrementing the nonce (number) of the header by one, then taking a double SHA-256 hash at each instance and comparing it with a target value to ascertain if lower than that target. It excessively consumes both time and power. In this paper, the authors, therefore, suggest using an inner for-loop for the population-based approach. Comparison shows that it's a slightly faster approach than brute force, with an average speed advantage of about 1.67% or 3,420 iterations per second and 73% of the time performing better. Also, we observed that the more the total particles deployed, the better the performance until a pivotal point. Furthermore, a recommendation on taming the excessive use of power by networks, like Bitcoin's, by using penalty by consensus is suggested.","[Adewumi, Tosin P.; Liwicki, Marcus] Lulea Univ Technol, Lulea, Sweden","Lulea University of Technology","Adewumi, TP (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Lulea, Sweden.","oluwatosin.adewumi@ltu.se; marcus.liwicki@ltu.se","","","","","","","21","2","2","1","1","DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O","WARSAW","BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND","2299-1093","","","OPEN COMPUT SCI","Open Comput.

For this purpose, a number of hypotheses of interest are tested for the Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin exchange rates vis-a-vis the US dollar over the period 01.01.2015-01.09.2019, specifically whether or not: (H1) the intraday behavior of hourly returns is different on abnormal days compared to normal days; (H2) there is a momentum effect on days with abnormal returns, and (H3) after one-day abnormal returns. The methods used for the analysis include various statistical methods as well as a trading simulation approach. The results suggest that hourly returns during the day of positive/negative abnormal returns are significantly higher/lower than those during the average positive/negative day. The presence of abnormal returns can usually be detected before the day ends by estimating specific timing parameters. Prices tend to move in the direction of the abnormal returns till the end of the day when it occurs, which implies the existence of a momentum effect on that day giving rise to exploitable profit opportunities. This effect (together with profit opportunities) is also observed on the following day. In two cases (BTCUSD positive abnormal returns and ETHUSD negative abnormal returns), a contrarian effect is detected instead.","[Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] Brunel Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, London UB8 3PH, England; [Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] CESifo, Berlin, Germany; [Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Plastun, Alex] Sumy State Univ, Dept Int Econ Relat, Sumy, Ukraine","Brunel University; Ifo Institut; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Sumy State University","Caporale, GM (corresponding author), Brunel Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, London UB8 3PH, England.;Caporale, GM (corresponding author), CESifo, Berlin, Germany.;Caporale, GM (corresponding author), DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany.","Guglielmo-Maria.Caporale@brunel.ac.uk; o.plastun@uabs.sumdu.edu.ua","; Plastun, Alex/L-7631-2014","Caporale, Guglielmo Maria/0000-0002-0144-4135; Plastun, Alex/0000-0001-8208-7135","Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine [0117U003936]","Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine","The second-named author gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine (0117U003936).","","52","7","7","2","6","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1934-4554","2373-8529","","FINANC MARK PORTFOLI","Financ.

This work analyses the evolution of the LN during its first year of existence in order to assess its impact over some of the core fundamentals of Bitcoin, such as: node centralization, resilience against attacks and disruptions, anonymity of users, autonomous coordination of its members. Using a network theory approach, we find that the LN represents a centralized configuration with few highly active nodes playing as hubs in that system. We show that the removal of these central nodes is likely to generate a remarkable drop in the LN's efficiency, while the network appears robust to random disruptions. In addition, we observe that improvements in efficiency during the sample period are primarily due to the increase in the capacity installed on the channels, while nodes' synchronization does not emerge as a distinctive feature of the LN. Finally, the analysis of the structure of the network suggests a good preservation of nodes' identity against attackers with prior knowledge about topological characteristics of their targets, but also that LN is probably weak against attackers that are within the system.","[Martinazzi, Stefano; Flori, Andrea] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Milan, Italy","Polytechnic University of Milan","Martinazzi, S (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Milan, Italy.","stefano.martinazzi@polimi.it","","Flori, Andrea/0000-0002-9861-3598; Martinazzi, Stefano/0000-0001-7323-4244","National Research Project (PNR) CRISIS Lab","National Research Project (PNR) CRISIS Lab","We thank Professor Fabio Pammolli and Professor Sergey Buldyrev for their precious comments and suggestions.

The fee is relative to the resources consumed when including the TX into a block. The sender of the TX pays for the fee in the native currency of the BC used. Such a fee protects the network from Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and provides incentives for TXs inclusion. BCs that support Smart Contracts (SC), thus, TXs can execute user-provided code, require a mechanism for fee calculation depending on the resources consumed by the code executed. Ethereum uses an elaborated mechanism compared to Bitcoin, leading to an increase in the attack surface of their SCs. The mechanism that makes the Bitcoin script - a limited version of SCs - more secure is the ability to compute, independent of the BC's state, an upper-bound on resources needed to execute this TX. Thus, this work proposes a new approach enabling security benefits by defining an upper-bound on resource usage for general SCs. Furthermore, the approach allows for the payment of fees in any currency and not just the native currency of the BC.","[Knecht, Markus; Stiller, Burkhard] Univ Zurich UZH, Dept Informat IfI, Commun Syst Grp CSG, Binzmuhlestr 14, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Knecht, Markus] Univ Appl Sci Northwestern Switzerland, Inst Mobile & Distributed Syst IMVS, Bahnhofstr 6, CH-5210 Windisch, Switzerland","University of Zurich; FHNW University of Applied Sciences & Arts Northwestern Switzerland","Knecht, M (corresponding author), Univ Zurich UZH, Dept Informat IfI, Commun Syst Grp CSG, Binzmuhlestr 14, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.;Knecht, M (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci Northwestern Switzerland, Inst Mobile & Distributed Syst IMVS, Bahnhofstr 6, CH-5210 Windisch, Switzerland.","markus.knecht2@uzh.ch; stiller@ifi.uzh.ch","","","","","","","18","0","0","0","0","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","2324-898X","","978-1-6654-0392-4","IEEE INT CONF TRUST","","","2020","","","","","","","1926","1934","","10.1109/TrustCom50675.2020.00263","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom50675.2020.00263","","","9","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BR8DU","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000671077600249","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Consequently, perpetrators can still conduct illicit behaviors such as money laundering. In this paper, we apply game theory under imperfect information to study how coins' quality restrain these illicit behaviors under the incomplete scenario. More specifically, we propose a strategy for participants to submit deposits if they hope to mix coins with others even if they are not in blacklist at this time. The deposits will not be refunded when participants are included in the blacklist after mixing. Therefore, no participants have incentives to mix with bad coins. At the last part of this paper, we also simulate the incomes for participants, which indicates that deposits strategy is effective to prevent illicit behaviors.","[Liu, Xiaozhang] Hainan Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Cyberspace Secur, Haikou, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Yu, Xinying; Zhu, Haojia; Yang, Guoyu; Wang, Yilei] Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Rizhao 276825, Peoples R China; [Yu, Xiaomei] Shandong Normal Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Jinan, Peoples R China","Hainan University; Qufu Normal University; Shandong Normal University","Wang, YL (corresponding author), Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Rizhao 276825, Peoples R China.","ylwangqfnu@163.com","","","Foundation of National Natural Science Foundation of China [61771231, 6150028, 61672321, 61771289, 61832012]; Major Basic Research Project of Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province of China [ZR2018ZC0438]; Natural Science Shandong Province [ZR2016FM23, ZR2017MF010, ZR2017MF062]; Key Research and Development Program of Shandong Province [2019GGX101025]","Foundation of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Basic Research Project of Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province of China; Natural Science Shandong Province; Key Research and Development Program of Shandong Province","Foundation of National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 61771231, 6150028, 61672321, 61771289, 61832012; The Major Basic Research Project of Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province of China, Grant/Award Number: ZR2018ZC0438; Natural Science Shandong Province, Grant/Award Numbers: ZR2016FM23, ZR2017MF010, ZR2017MF062; Key Research and Development Program of Shandong Province, Grant/Award Number: 2019GGX101025","","29","9","9","1","4","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0884-8173","1098-111X","","INT J INTELL SYST","Int.

The objective of the present study was to explore this question within a real-world situation in which participants invested in Bitcoin, a risky asset. The article focuses on cases of a socially-defined counterfactual loss-situations in which the people in one's social context experience a gain, which functions as a new reference point against which the individual falls short. Although a prevention focus is known to predict risky behavior following an actual loss (Scholer, Zou, Fujita, Stroessner, & Higgins, 2010), no previous research has explored whether prevention predicts risk-taking after a counterfactual loss. Results revealed that a stronger prevention focus predicted decreased risk-taking among participants who experienced a counterfactual loss; no such effect was detected among a control group (to visualize model predictions dynamically, see https://emilynakka.shinyapps.io/RFCFLoss/). Further, this effect was mediated by hypothetical feelings of relief when imagining that one had previously invested in Bitcoin.

Ethereum (ETH), a second generation of cryptocurrency, extends Bitcoin's design by offering a Turing-complete programming language called Solidity to develop smart contracts. Smart contracts allow creditable execution of contracts on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) without third parties. Developing correct and secure smart contracts is challenging due to the decentralized computation nature of the blockchain. Buggy smart contracts may lead to huge financial loss. Furthermore, smart contracts are very hard, if not impossible, to patch once they are deployed. Thus, there is a recent surge of interest in analyzing and verifying smart contracts. While most of the existing works either focus on EVM bytecode or translate Solidity smart contracts into programs in intermediate languages, we argue that it is important and necessary to understand and formally define the semantics of Solidity since programmers write and reason about smart contracts at the level of source code. In this work, we develop a formal semantics for Solidity which provides a formal specification of smart contracts to define semantic-level security properties for the high-level verification. Furthermore, the proposed semantics defines correct and secure high-level execution behaviours of smart contracts to reason about compiler bugs and assist developers in writing secure smart contracts.","[Jiao, Jiao; Kan, Shuanglong; Lin, Shang-Wei; Sanan, David; Liu, Yang] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore; [Sun, Jun] Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore","Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Singapore Management University","Jiao, J (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore.","jiao0023@ntu.edu.sg; slkan@ntu.edu.sg; shang-wei.lin@ntu.edu.sg; sanan@ntu.edu.sg; yangliu@ntu.edu.sg; junsun@smu.edu.sg","Liu, Yang/D-2306-2013; Sanan, David/AAA-8320-2020","Liu, Yang/0000-0001-7300-9215; Sanan, David/0000-0003-2755-3089","Ministry of Education, Singapore under its Tier-2 Project [MOE2018-T2-1-068]; National Research Foundation, Singapore under its NSoE Programme [NSOE-TSS2019-03]","Ministry of Education, Singapore under its Tier-2 Project; National Research Foundation, Singapore under its NSoE Programme","This work is supported by the Ministry of Education, Singapore under its Tier-2 Project (Award Number: MOE2018-T2-1-068) and partially supported by the National Research Foundation, Singapore under its NSoE Programme (Award Number: NSOE-TSS2019-03).","","51","13","15","3","8","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","1081-6011","","978-1-7281-3497-0","P IEEE S SECUR PRIV","","","2020","","","","","","","1695","1712","","10.1109/SP40000.2020.00066","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SP40000.2020.00066","","","18","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BQ7OO","","Bronze, Green Accepted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000618063500100","View Full Record in Web of Science"

At the same time, national jurisdictions no longer have the opportunity to ignore the fact of business working with crypto assets. Meanwhile, without consensus in the consistent resolution of financial, tax, and other cross-country relations, operations with crypto assets can belong to the underground economy sphere to a large extent. In this regard, the issues of regulating macroeconomic factors when reflecting crypto assets in the structure of the current classification, the procedure for their fair valuation, taking into account the formation of classification and content construction in the financial statements of companies, are relevant. Another aspect is to conduct comprehensive analysis in order to consider scientific and practical approaches to the procedure of classification and evaluation of cryptographic assets in scientific research, professional judgments of major audit international organizations. In this regard, the study focuses on a practical analysis of the current accounting policies of companies operating with crypto assets, taking into account the position of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC). Based on the results of the conducted research, the existing models of classification and evaluation of crypto assets are assessed, and the most problematic practical aspects of their application are highlighted. This made it possible to propose promising models for managing the value of crypto assets, containing the existing practices currently used by companies and their possible directions. It was concluded that the most promising way out of the conflict of interests of business and the current rules of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is to refine the existing standards, introduce rules of classification and evaluation of crypto assets.

To address this caveat, this paper attempts to investigate the spillover effects among 14 cryptocurrencies by employing transfer entropy. Our results suggest that among different types of cryptos, Bitcoin is still the most appropriate instrument for hedging, while Tether (USDT) which have a strong anchor with the US dollar is significantly volatile. Interestingly, we document that the small coins are more likely to be shock creators in the cryptocurrency market. Using the same approach, we further explored the link between gold prices and cryptocurrency prices. The results show that gold could be a good hedging instrument for cryptocurrencies due to its independence. In light of empirical results, it is advisable to carefully consider the coins with small capitalization. Further, investors should conduct portfolio rebalancing by including gold to hedge against the unexpected movement in the cryptocurrency market.

We utilized the multifractal detrending moving average cross-correlation analysis (MF-X-DMA) method to examine the multifractal features among data. We find that the cross-correlations between each pair of time series are significant by using the cross-correlation test statistic Q(cc)(m)''-analysis and detrended moving average crosscorrelation analysis (DMCA) coefficient. Also, the cross-correlation coefficients.DMCA show that the data are positively correlated, but the degree of correlation has been elevated by increasing the window intervals v. The observed results obtained through the MF-X-DMA method infer the existence of multifractal cross-correlations on ten bivariate time series in the study and that the strength of multifractality between Ethereum and Ripple is the highest, followed by the strength of multifractality between WTI crude oil and Ethereum.

It was developed for the world's first cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin in 2008. The reason behind its popularity was its properties which provide pseudonymity, security, and data integrity without third-party intervention. Initially, most of the researches were focused on the Bitcoin system and its limitation, but later other applications of Blockchain e.g. smart contracts and licensing [1] also got famous. Blockchain technology has the potential to change the way how transactions are conducted in daily life. It is not limited to cryptocurrencies but could be possibly applied in various environments where any forms of transactions are done. This article presents a comprehensive overview of Blockchain technology, its development, applications, security issues, and their countermeasures. In particular, the security towards illegal data insertion and the countermeasures is focused. Our analysis of countermeasures of illegal data insertion can be combined for increased efficiency. After the introduction of the Blockchain and consensus algorithm, some famous Blockchain applications and expected future of Blockchain are deliberated. Then, the technical challenges of Blockchain are discussed, in which the main focus here is on the security and the data insertion in Blockchain. The review of the possible countermeasures to overcome the security issues related to data insertion are elaborated.","[Aitsam, Muhammad; Chantaraskul, Soamsiri] King Mongkuts Univ Technol North Bangkok, Sirindhorm Int Thai German Grad Sch Engn, 1518 Pracharaj 1 Rd, Bangkok 10800, Thailand","King Mongkuts University of Technology North Bangkok","Chantaraskul, S (corresponding author), King Mongkuts Univ Technol North Bangkok, Sirindhorm Int Thai German Grad Sch Engn, 1518 Pracharaj 1 Rd, Bangkok 10800, Thailand.","amuhamad.a-ce2018@tggs.kmutnb.ac.th; soamsiri.c@tggs.kmutnb.ac.th","Aitsam, Muhammad/ABC-4316-2021","Aitsam, Muhammad/0000-0002-4157-7282","","","","","47","2","2","3","7","CHULALONGKORN UNIV, FAC ENGINEERING","BANGKOK","254 PHAYATHAI RD, PATHUMWAN, BANGKOK, 10330, THAILAND","0125-8281","","","ENG J-THAIL","Eng.

The study applies Jarque-Bera test, ADF test, Ljung-Box statistics and ARCH-LM test for testing normality of returns, stationarity of series, serial correlation and volatility clustering in returns and squared returns of selected cryptocurrencies. Further, the study adopts an extremely important category of martingale difference hypothesis (MDH), which uses non-linear methods of dependencies for identifying changing linear and non-linear dependence in the price movement of currencies. The results indicate that price movements with linear and nonlinear dependences varies over time. Our tests also reveal that Bitcoin, Monaro and Litecoin have the longest efficiency periods. While Steller shows the longest inefficient market period. In view of varying market conditions, the results indicate that different market periods have significant impact on prices fluctuations of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, our findings suggest implementing the adaptive market hypothesis (AMH) as predicting changes in cryptocurrency prices over time must consider the time-varying market conditions for efficient forecasting.","[Khursheed, Ambreen; Naeem, Muhammad; Mustafa, Faisal] Univ Cent Punjab, Fac Management Studies, UCP Business Sch, 1 Khayaban E Jinnah Rd, Lahore, Pakistan; [Ahmed, Sheraz] LUT Univ, Sch Business & Management, Lappeenranta, Finland","University of Central Punjab","Khursheed, A (corresponding author), Univ Cent Punjab, Business Sch, Lahore, Pakistan.","ambreen.khursheed@ucp.edu.pk; muhammad.naeem@ucp.edu.pk; Sheraz.Ahmed@lut.fi; faisal.mustafa@ucp.edu.pk","Ahmed, Sheraz/I-9346-2012; Naeem, Muhammad Abubakr/HCH-3576-2022","Ahmed, Sheraz/0000-0001-6836-2030; Naeem, Muhammad/0000-0002-9071-1708; Naeem, Muhammad Abubakr/0000-0001-6962-3175","","","","","43","6","6","1","5","TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS","OSLO","KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY","2332-2039","","","COGENT ECON FINANC","Cogent Econ.

Many privacy coins deliberately position themselves as alternative political brands. Although cryptocurrencies are often closely associated with political philosophies that aim to diminish or subvert the power of governments and banks, advocates of privacy occupy much broader ideological ground.

SDN aims to efficiently transform network architecture and operations to be agile, and effectively enrich the functionality of underlying network elements, such as routers and switches, by decoupling the control plane from the data plane. In SDN, the network intelligence is centralized in a software entity so-called SDN controller, which enables network administrators to dynamically manage, secure, and optimize network resources and programmatically shape all entire network traffic pattern. Despite the impressive benefits SDN has brought to network architecture, it introduces new security challenges and prompts different implementation strategies to spread attack vectors.

However, initial blockchain applications (like Bitcoin) attain very low throughput, which has promoted the design of permissioned blockchain systems. These permissioned blockchain systems employ classical Byzantine-Fault Tolerant (BET) protocols to reach consensus. However, existing permissioned blockchain systems still attain low throughputs (of the order 10K txns/s). As a result, existing works blame this low throughput on the associated BFT protocol and expend resources in developing optimized protocols. We believe such blames only depict a one-sided story. In specific, we raise a simple question: can a well-crafted system based on a classical BET protocol outperform a modern protocol? We show that designing such a well-crafted system is possible and illustrate that even if such a system employs a three-phase protocol, it can outperform another system utilizing a single-phase protocol. This endeavor requires us to dissect a permissioned blockchain system and highlight different factors that affect its performance. Based on our insights, we present the design of our enterprise-grade, high-throughput yielding permissioned blockchain system, ResilientDB, that employs multi-threaded deep pipelines, to balance tasks at a replica, and provides guidelines for future designs.","[Gupta, Suyash; Rahnama, Sajjad; Sadoghi, Mohammad] Univ Calif Davis, Exploratory Syst Lab, MokaBlox LLC, Davis, CA 95616 USA","University of California System; University of California Davis","Gupta, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Exploratory Syst Lab, MokaBlox LLC, Davis, CA 95616 USA.","","","Gupta, Suyash/0000-0002-3240-1840","DOE [DE-SC0020455]","DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","We would like to thank DOE Award No. DE-SC0020455 for funding our startup MokaBlox LLC.","","44","4","4","1","2","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","1063-6927","","978-1-7281-7002-2","INT CON DISTR COMP S","","","2020","","","","","","","754","764","","10.1109/ICDCS47774.2020.00012","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS47774.2020.00012","","","11","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR7JC","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000667971400069","View Full Record in Web of Science"

As the variety of existing blockchains and distributed ledgers continues to increase, adopters should focus on selecting the solution that best fits their needs and the requirements of their decentralized applications, rather than developing yet another blockchain from scratch. In this article we present a conceptual framework to aid software architects, developers, and decision makers to adopt the right blockchain technology. The framework exposes the interrelation between technological decisions and architectural features, capturing the knowledge from existing academic literature, industrial products, technical forums/blogs, and experts' feedback. We empirically show the applicability of our framework by dissecting the platforms behind Bitcoin and other top 10 cryptocurrencies, aided by a focus group with researchers and industry practitioners. Then, we leverage the framework together with key notions of the architectural tradeoff analysis method to analyze four real-world blockchain case studies from industry and academia. Results shown that applying our framework leads to a deeper understanding of the architectural tradeoffs, allowing to assess technologies more objectively and select the one that best fit developers' needs, ultimately cutting costs, reducing time-to-market and accelerating return on investment.","[Garriga, Martin; Dalla Palma, Stefano] Tilburg Sch Econ & Management, Dept Management, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Garriga, Martin; Dalla Palma, Stefano; Andrew Tamburri, Damian] Jheronimus Acad Data Sci, JADE Lab, Den Bosch, Netherlands; [Garriga, Martin] Natl Univ Comahue, Fac Informat, CONICET, Neuquen, Argentina; [Arias, Maxmiliano; De Renzis, Alan] Fidtech, Neuquen, Argentina; [Pareschi, Remo] Univ Molise, Dept Biosci & Terr, Molise, Italy; [Andrew Tamburri, Damian] Tech Univ Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Netherlands","Tilburg University; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad Nacional del Comahue; University of Molise; Eindhoven University of Technology","Garriga, M (corresponding author), Jheronimus Acad Data Sci, ADE Lab, Den Bosch, Netherlands.","m.garriga@jads.nl","Tamburri, Damian Andrew/AAJ-2507-2021","Tamburri, Damian Andrew/0000-0003-1230-8961; Garriga, Martin/0000-0002-3056-3678; Pareschi, Remo/0000-0002-4912-582X; Dalla Palma, Stefano/0000-0002-5611-0546","Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica [PICT-2017-1725]; H2020 European Institute of Innovation and Technology [825040RADON, 825480SODALITE]","Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica(ANPCyT); H2020 European Institute of Innovation and Technology","Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Grant/Award Number: PICT-2017-1725; H2020 European Institute of Innovation and Technology, Grant/Award Numbers: 825040RADON, 825480SODALITE","","70","14","14","3","4","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1532-0626","1532-0634","","CONCURR COMP-PRACT E","Concurr.

Fog computing, an extension of cloud-based IoT-oriented solutions, has emerged with requirements for distribution and decentralization. In this respect, the conjunction with Blockchain provides a natural solution for decentralization, as well as potentially helps fog computing overcome some deficiencies such as security and privacy then consequently expand the application scope of IoT. However, one of the key challenges of blockchain's integration with fog computing is scalability. To end this, this work proposes Groupchain, a novel scalable public blockchain of a two-chain structure suitable for fog computing of IoT services computing. Groupchain employs the leader group to collectively commit blocks for higher transaction efficiency and introduces bonus and deposit into the incentive mechanism to supervise behaviors of members in the leader group. Our security analysis shows that Groupchain retains the security of Bitcoin-like blockchain and enhances defense against attacks such as double-spend and selfish mining. We implement a prototype of Groupchain and conducted experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that Groupchain achieves optimization on transaction throughput and confirmation latency which are argued in Bitcoin.","[Lei, Kai; Du, Maoyu; Huang, Jiyue] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Informat Centr Networking & Bloc, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Lei, Kai; Du, Maoyu; Huang, Jiyue] PCL Res Ctr Networks & Commun, Peng Cheng Lab, Shenzhen 518066, Peoples R China; [Jin, Tong] Peking Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Shenzhen Key Lab Cloud Comp Technol & Applicat, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China","Peking University; Peng Cheng Laboratory; Peking University","Lei, K (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Informat Centr Networking & Bloc, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.","leik@pkusz.edu.cn; mydu@sz.pku.edu.cn; huangjiyue@sz.pku.edu.cn; 1501213944@sz.pku.edu.cn","","","Shenzhen Key Laboratory Project [ZDSYS201802051831427]; project PCL Future Regional Network Facilities for Large-scale Experiments and Applications","Shenzhen Key Laboratory Project; project PCL Future Regional Network Facilities for Large-scale Experiments and Applications","This work was financially supported by Shenzhen Key Laboratory Project (ZDSYS201802051831427) and the project PCL Future Regional Network Facilities for Large-scale Experiments and Applications.","","38","46","47","6","24","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA","1939-1374","","","IEEE T SERV COMPUT","IEEE Trans.

However, several investors' capital decreased when they tried to trade the basis of the recommendation of these strategies. That means the stock market needs more satisfactory research, which can give more guarantee of success for investors. To address this challenge, we tried to apply one of the machine learning algorithms, which is called deep reinforcement learning (DRL) on the stock market. As a result, we developed an application that observes historical price movements and takes action on real-time prices. We tested our proposal algorithm with three-Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum (ETH)-crypto coins' historical data.

For the stock market indices, the results are more homogeneous and the unit root cannot be rejected in any of the series, with the exception of VIX where mean reversion is obtained. Concerning bivariate results within the cryptocurrencies and testing for cointegration, we provide evidence of no cointegration between the six cryptocurrencies. Along the same lines, testing for cointegration between the cryptocurrencies and the stock market indices, we find evidence of no cointegration, which implies that the cryptocurrencies are decoupled from the mainstream financial and economic assets. The findings in this paper indicate the significant role of cryptocurrencies in investor portfolios since they serve as a diversification option for investors, confirming that cryptocurrency is a new investment asset class.","[Alberiko Gil-Alana, Luis] Univ Navarra, Fac Econ, E-31090 Pamplona, Spain; [Abakah, Emmanuel Joel Aikins] Univ Adelaide, Sch Business, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Romero Rojo, Maria Fatima] Univ Francisco de Vitoria, Madrid, Spain","University of Navarra; University of Adelaide; Universidad Francisco de Vitoria","Gil-Alana, LA (corresponding author), Univ Navarra, Fac Econ, E-31090 Pamplona, Spain.","alana@unav.es","Romero, Fatima/GSJ-0332-2022","Abakah, Emmanuel Joel Aikins/0000-0003-1472-0722","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO201785503]","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government)","Prof. Luis A.

However, we argue that transaction execution is also important to the performance and security of blockchains. In other words, there are ample opportunities to speed up and further secure blockchains by reducing the cost of transaction execution. Our goal is to understand how much we can speed up blockchains by exploiting transaction concurrency available in blockchain workloads. To this end, we first analyze historical data of seven major public blockchains, namely Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and Zilliqa. We consider two metrics for concurrency, namely the single-transaction conflict rate per block, and the group conflict rate per block. We find that there is more concurrency in UTXO-based blockchains than in account-based ones, although the amount of concurrency in the former is lower than expected. Another interesting finding is that some blockchains with larger blocks have more concurrency than blockchains with smaller blocks. Next, we propose an analytical model for estimating the transaction execution speed-up given an amount of concurrency. Using results from our empirical analysis, the model estimates that 6x speed-ups in Ethereum can be achieved if all available concurrency is exploited.","[Reijsbergen, Daniel; Dinh, Tien Tuan Anh] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Singapore, Singapore","Singapore University of Technology & Design","Reijsbergen, D (corresponding author), Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Singapore, Singapore.","","Dinh, Tien Tuan Anh/AAB-1363-2022","Dinh, Tien Tuan Anh/0000-0002-8158-3636","National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, under its National Cybersecurity RD Programme; National Satellite of Excellence in Design Science and Technology for Secure Critical Infrastructure [NSoE DeST-SCI2019-0009]","National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, under its National Cybersecurity RD Programme(National Research Foundation, Singapore); National Satellite of Excellence in Design Science and Technology for Secure Critical Infrastructure","This research/project is supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, under its National Cybersecurity R&D Programme and administered by the National Satellite of Excellence in Design Science and Technology for Secure Critical Infrastructure, Award No. NSoE DeST-SCI2019-0009.","","19","4","4","1","3","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","1063-6927","","978-1-7281-7002-2","INT CON DISTR COMP S","","","2020","","","","","","","1044","1054","","10.1109/ICDCS47774.2020.00083","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS47774.2020.00083","","","11","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR7JC","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000667971400095","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The criminal activities extend to tax evasion, money laundering, Ponzi schemes, and the theft of cryptocurrencies to kidnapping for ransom. As the demand for cryptocurrencies increases, it provides opportunities for criminals to hide behind the presumed privacy and anonymity. Identifying these cryptocurrency-related crimes have posed challenges for law enforcement due to the cross-border nature of transactions, the use of evasion technology to mask the identity of users, and inconsistent regulations. To address the role of cryptocurrencies in criminal activities, the study focused on four research questions: (1) What role do cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) play in criminal activities? (2) What factors facilitate cryptocurrency-related criminal activities? (3) What role do politics play in regulating cryptocurrencies? and (4) What are the challenges they pose for regulators and law enforcement? To answer the questions, the study utilized a systematic content review of the news reports, court cases, scholarly articles, online search engines, and commentaries relevant to regulations and reforms. The findings help to understand the current climate of virtual currencies, their use in criminal activities, and the complexities involved in regulating cryptocurrencies.","[Kethineni, Sesha; Cao, Ying] Prairie View A&M Univ, Coll Juvenile Justice & Psychol, POB 519,MS 2600, Prairie View, TX 77446 USA","Texas A&M University System; Prairie View A&M University","Kethineni, S (corresponding author), Prairie View A&M Univ, Coll Juvenile Justice & Psychol, POB 519,MS 2600, Prairie View, TX 77446 USA.","srkethineni@pvamu.edu","","","","","","","83","29","29","7","65","SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","THOUSAND OAKS","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","1057-5677","1556-3855","","INT CRIM JUSTICE REV","Int.

The corresponding dynamics predominantly involve one leading eigenvalue of the correlation matrix, while the others largely coincide with those of Wishart random matrices. However, the magnitude of the principal eigenvalue, and thus the degree of collectivity, strongly depends on which cryptocurrency is used as a base. It is largest when the base is the most peripheral cryptocurrency; when more significant ones are taken into consideration, its magnitude systematically decreases, nevertheless preserving a sizable gap with respect to the random bulk, which in turn indicates that the organization of correlations becomes more heterogeneous. This finding provides a criterion for recognizing which currencies or cryptocurrencies play a dominant role in the global cryptomarket. The present study shows that over the period under consideration, the Bitcoin (BTC) predominates, hallmarking exchange rate dynamics at least as influential as the U.S. dollar (USD). Even more, the BTC started dominating around the year 2017, while other cryptocurrencies, such as the Ethereum and even Ripple, assumed similar trends. At the same time, the USD, an original value determinant for the cryptocurrency market, became increasingly disconnected, and its related characteristics eventually started approaching those of a fictitious currency. These results are strong indicators of incipient independence of the global cryptocurrency market, delineating a self-contained trade resembling the Forex.","[Drozdz, Stanislaw; Minati, Ludovico; Oswiecimka, Pawel; Watorek, Marcin] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Nucl Phys, Complex Syst Theory Dept, Ul Radzikowskiego 152, PL-31342 Krakow, Poland; [Drozdz, Stanislaw; Stanuszek, Marek; Watorek, Marcin] Cracow Univ Technol, Fac Comp Sci & Telecommun, Ul Warszawska 24, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland","Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Nuclear Physics - Polish Academy of Sciences; Cracow University of Technology","Drozdz, S (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Nucl Phys, Complex Syst Theory Dept, Ul Radzikowskiego 152, PL-31342 Krakow, Poland.;Drozdz, S (corresponding author), Cracow Univ Technol, Fac Comp Sci & Telecommun, Ul Warszawska 24, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland.","stanislaw.drozdz@ifj.edu.pl","Wątorek, Marcin/ABG-2495-2021; Wątorek, Marcin/P-3112-2017; Minati, Ludovico/R-1076-2017; Drozdz, Stanislaw/V-7101-2018; Oswiecimka, Pawel/V-7037-2018","Wątorek, Marcin/0000-0002-2131-7440; Wątorek, Marcin/0000-0002-2131-7440; Minati, Ludovico/0000-0002-2532-1674; STANUSZEK, Marek/0000-0001-5171-3770; Drozdz, Stanislaw/0000-0003-1613-6175; Oswiecimka, Pawel/0000-0001-7582-8767","","","","","38","28","28","2","9","AMER INST PHYSICS","MELVILLE","1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA","1054-1500","1089-7682","","CHAOS","Chaos","FEB","2020","30","2","","","","","","","23122","10.1063/1.5139634","http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.5139634","","","8","Mathematics, Applied; Physics, Mathematical","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Mathematics; Physics","KP9TX","32113224","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000516575700003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Offline channels provide Path-Based fund Transfer (PBT) service which allows a pair of peers without amutual channel to transfer fund between them using paths in the channel network. In PBTs, peers allow a 3rd party to use their channel for fund transfer in exchange for a transfer fee. There are channels in the Bitcoin Lightning network which are designed to collect such PBT transfer fees. An analysis of Bitcoin's Lightning network revealed the existence of hubs or nodes with very high degree in the channel network. There are only 10 nodes who own more than 50% funds in the Lightning network. These nodes are designed to facilitate PBTs among peers with a low degree (number of channels) in exchange for transfer fees. The emergence of hubs in channel network created the possibility of collusion attack on the channel network where a group of hubs deliberatelymake few channels non-operational to prevent PBTs involving a selected set of hubs (victims of the collusion attack). In this paper, we model such collusion attack using cooperative game theory and using Banzhaf index we classify the vulnerability of the hubs from the collusion attacks. We propose a design principle of the channel network that can decrease the possibility of collusion attacks.","[Thakur, Subhasis; Breslin, John G.] Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland","Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway","Breslin, JG (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland.","subhasis.thakur@nuigalway.ie; john.breslin@nuigalway.ie","Breslin, John/B-7025-2015","Breslin, John/0000-0001-5790-050X; thakur, subhasis/0000-0001-6579-724X","Science Foundation Ireland (SFI); Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on behalf of the Government of Ireland [SFI 16/RC/3835]; European Regional Development Fund","Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)(Science Foundation Ireland); Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on behalf of the Government of Ireland; European Regional Development Fund(European Commission)","This publication has emanated from research supported in part by a research grant from Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on behalf of the Government of Ireland under Grant Number SFI 16/RC/3835 (VistaMilk), co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund.","","15","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","2198-7246","2198-7254","978-3-030-37110-4; 978-3-030-37109-8","SPR PROC BUS ECON","","","2020","","","","","","","31","44","","10.1007/978-3-030-37110-4_3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-37110-4_3","","","14","Business; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics; Computer Science; Mathematics","BR9FH","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000675370400002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The first such example, Bitcoin, strongly advocates a principle of total openness, which is reflected in the fact that all transactions are public and the history of each account can easily be reconstructed. Although an account cannot immediately be linked to a real-world identity, this does not grant strong guarantees of anonymity, and such a feature of Bitcoin and similar blockchains prevents it from reaching wide acceptance for financial use-cases, where users often desire strong confidentiality of their balances and financial history. As a consequence, there has recently been a growing interest in privacy-enhancing technologies that ensure public permission-less blockchains can keep the details of transactions private according to particular use cases. One of the most promising technologies in this area is Zero-Knowledge Proofs, and in particular zk-SNARKs, due to their very short proofs and verification times. This makes them well suited to be used as transaction data, hiding all the private details at the same time they guarantee the integrity and accuracy of the transaction, and to be verified on-chain by a smart contract. This paper is an introductory presentation of this topic, what advantages zk-SNARKs bring to the blockchain ecosystem and how they can be tailored to specific applications.","[Pinto, Alexandre Miranda] Artos Syst, 160 Fleet St, London EC4A 2DQ, England","","Pinto, AM (corresponding author), Artos Syst, 160 Fleet St, London EC4A 2DQ, England.","alex.miranda.pinto@gmail.com","","","","","","","31","3","4","0","2","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","2198-7246","2198-7254","978-3-030-37110-4; 978-3-030-37109-8","SPR PROC BUS ECON","","","2020","","","","","","","233","249","","10.1007/978-3-030-37110-4_16","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-37110-4_16","","","17","Business; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics; Computer Science; Mathematics","BR9FH","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000675370400015","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, for various reasons this distribution cannot be completely up-to-date, introducing a gap between the present stake distribution, which determines the parties' current incentives, and the one used by the protocol. In this paper, we investigate this issue, and empirically quantify its effects. We survey existing provably secure PoS proposals to observe that the above time gap between the two stake distributions, which we call stake distribution lag, amounts to several days for each of these protocols. Based on this, we investigate the ledgers of four major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Zcash) and compute the average stake shift (the statistical distance of the two distributions) for each value of stake distribution lag between 1 and 14 days, as well as related statistics. We also empirically quantify the sublinear growth of stake shift with the length of the considered lag interval. Finally, we turn our attention to unusual stake-shift spikes in these currencies: we observe that hard forks trigger major stake shifts and that single real-world actors, mostly exchanges, account for major stake shifts in established cryptocurrency ecosystems.","[Stuetz, Rainer; Haslhofer, Bernhard] AIT Austrian Inst Technol, Vienna, Austria; [Gazi, Peter] IOHK, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Illum, Jacob] Chainalysis, New York, NY USA","Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT)","Stutz, R (corresponding author), AIT Austrian Inst Technol, Vienna, Austria.","Rainer.Stuetz@ait.ac.at","","Stuetz, Rainer/0000-0001-9244-1441; Haslhofer, Bernhard/0000-0002-0415-4491","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [740558]; Austrian FFG's KIRAS programme under project VIRTCRIME [860672]","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; Austrian FFG's KIRAS programme under project VIRTCRIME","We thank Patrick McCorry for reviewing and commenting on the final draft, and our AIT colleagues Hannes Koller and Melitta Dragaschnig for insightful discussions regarding the Apache Spark implementation.

We propose a two-step strategy for making the system robust to double-spend attacks. The first step is the graph clustering algorithm based on spectral graph theory for separating the blocks created by the non-cooperating miners (attacker) in the blockchain network followed by the second step-the ordering algorithm based on the topological ordering of the blockDAG using the references included in block header. The first step is an unsupervised learning classification of the vertices of a graph into two classes. The simulation results show that the proposed clustering Algorithm based consensus protocol counter-attack the attacker's double-spending strategy by eliminating the attacker blocks created during attacking phase from the confirmed list of the blocks. In bitcoin's longest chain rule protocol, the ledger takes the chain of blocks and it operates with the overestimation of the network's end-to-end propagation delay which results in a low transaction throughput. Bitcoin protocol guarantees the security through longest chain rule but it suffers from the limited transaction scalability. The proposed consensus protocol works better for higher block creation rates in turn improves the transaction throughput without compromising the security of the blocks from double-spending attack.","[Reddy, Swaroopa B.; Sharma, G.

While this problem has been known to be unsolvable since 1985, existing protocols were designed these past three decades to solve consensus under various assumptions. Today, with the recent advent of blockchains, various consensus implementations were proposed to make replicas reach an agreement on the order of transactions updating what is often referred to as a distributed ledger. Very little work has however been devoted to explore its theoretical ramifications. As a result existing proposals are sometimes misunderstood and it is often unclear whether the problems arising during their executions are due to implementation bugs or more fundamental design issues. In this paper, we discuss the mainstream blockchain consensus algorithms and how the classic Byzantine consensus can be revisited for the blockchain context. In particular, we discuss proof-of-work consensus and illustrate the differences between the Bitcoin and the Ethereum proof-of-work consensus algorithms. Based on these definitions, we warn about the dangers of using these blockchains without understanding precisely the guarantees their consensus algorithm offers. In particular, we survey attacks against the Bitcoin and the Ethereum consensus algorithms. We finally discuss the advantage of the recent Blockchain Byzantine consensus definition over previous definitions, and the promises offered by emerging consistent blockchains. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Such algorithms achieve consistency for blocks in the chain as a function of their depth from the end of the chain. While the analysis of Bitcoin guarantees consistency with error 2(-k) for blocks of depth O(k), the state-of-the-art of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains suffers from a quadratic dependence on k: these protocols, exemplified by Ouroboros (Crypto 2017), Ouroboros Praos (Eurocrypt 2018) and Sleepy Consensus (Asiacrypt 2017), can only establish that depth circle minus(k(2)) is sufficient. Whether this quadratic gap is an intrinsic limitation of PoS due to issues such as the nothing-at-stake problem has been an urgent open question, as deployed PoS blockchains further rely on consistency for protocol correctnes. We give an axiomatic theory of blockchain dynamics that permits rigorous reasoning about the longest-chain rule and achieve, in broad generality, circle minus(k) dependence on depth in order to achieve consistency error 2(-k). In particular, for the first time we show that PoS protocols can match proof-of-work protocols for linear consistency. We analyze the associated stochastic process, give a recursive relation for the critical functionals of this process, and derive tail bounds in both i.i.d. and martingale settings via associated generating functions.","[Blum, Erica] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Kiayias, Aggelos] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Kiayias, Aggelos; Russell, Alexander] IOHK, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Moore, Cristopher] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Quader, Saad; Russell, Alexander] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Edinburgh; The Santa Fe Institute; University of Connecticut","Russell, A (corresponding author), IOHK, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.;Russell, A (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.","erblum@cs.umd.edu; akiayias@inf.ed.ac.uk; moore@santafe.edu; saad.quader@uconn.edu; acr@cse.uconn.edu","","Russell, Alexander/0000-0002-8228-6238; Moore, Cristopher/0000-0002-2062-1942","U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology [70NANB19H126]; H2020 Grant [780477]; NSF [BIGDATA-1838251, 1717432]","U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology(National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) - USA); H2020 Grant; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","Erica Blum's work was partly supported by financial assistance award 70NANB19H126 from U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology.

A routing algorithm for PBT finds a suitable path for PBT execution. The problems with the landmark-based routing algorithms for PBT executions are as follows: (1) PBTs through hubs may cause privacy problems as a few landmarks can collude to find the sender and the receiver of a PBT, (2) Landmarks can be targeted with DoS or Eclipse attack. Unavailability of landmarks will lead to a high failure rate of PBT and (3) the unavailability of nodes for PBT execution creates cuts in the trees maintained by landmark-based routing protocols, which will lead to failure of PBT execution. In this paper, we mitigate the above problems with routing algorithms for PBT execution with a graph edge colouring-based routing protocol. In this routing protocol, every peer maintains a set of small subgraphs of the channel network with a particular topology. The peers exchange such subgraph information to find an appropriate path for PBT execution. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We develop a distributed algorithm to find subgraphs maintained by a peer. We prove that despite sharing subgraph information, our protocol preserves the privacy of the sender and the receiver of a PBT. (2) We prove that the proposed protocol is secure against adversarial peers initially agrees to participate in PBT execution and included in the trees or subgraphs computed by landmark-based or our edge colour-based routing algorithm, but later they do not participate in PBT execution. (3) We show that trees built by landmark-based algorithms require more frequent rebuilding as values in individual channels are changed over time compared with subgraphs to be maintained by the peers. (4) We show that the success rate and time to execute PBT for the proposed edge colouring-based routing algorithm is competitive against the landmark-based routing algorithm. (5) We show that DoS attacks resulting unavailability of peers have less impact on the proposed routing algorithm compared with landmark-based routing algorithms.","[Thakur, Subhasis; Breslin, John G.] Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland","Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway","Thakur, S (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland.","subhasis.thakur@nuigalway.ie; john.breslin@nuigalway.ie","Breslin, John/B-7025-2015","Breslin, John/0000-0001-5790-050X","Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) [SFI/12/RC/2289 P2]; Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on behalf of the Government of Ireland [SFI 16/RC/3835]; European Regional Development Fund","Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)(Science Foundation Ireland); Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on behalf of the Government of Ireland; European Regional Development Fund(European Commission)","This publication has emanated from research supported in part by a research grant from Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on behalf of the Government of Ireland under Grant Number SFI 16/RC/3835 (VistaMilk), and also by a research grant from Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) under Grant Number SFI/12/RC/2289 P2 (Insight), with both grants cofunded by the European Regional Development Fund.","","11","0","0","2","3","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-0-7381-0495-9","","","","2020","","","","","","","343","350","","10.1109/Blockchain50366.2020.00050","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain50366.2020.00050","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR3LS","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000647642100041","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Bandelj, F. Wherry, and V. Zelizer, comprises a series of articles united in a collective monograph; it opens the reader to a multilateral view of the nature of money as a system of meanings and signs, and clarifies the mechanisms of the formation and functioning of financial flows and institutions. Trends associated with the active dissemination of new forms of money that are not tied to a specific financial system, as well as the expanding practice of the consumption of goods and services related to issues of morality and ethics, are becoming relevant. The authors were tasked with revising the conceptual framework for the study of money, and the main goal was to show the principles of the functioning of money in the financial system and, to a greater extent, in the system of social relations. In the book, the conceptual framework is examined in five sections, each of which provides sociological, cultural, anthropological, and historical perspectives. The authors of 14 chapters illustrate the connection of their theses with the approach of Viviana Zelizer, as outlined in a number of her famous works, and the analysis of money itself is based on the subject of the fungibility of mediums, functions, and meanings (earmarking) of monetary units, the understanding of financial accounting by people themselves (mental accounting), and the influence of the state on this process. This review aims to define the logic of the presentation of the material in the book in order to better understand the theoretical and empirical principles set forth in the chapters.","[Pashkov, Stanislav] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Fac Social Sci, 20 Myasnitskaya Str, Moscow 101000, Russia; [Pashkov, Stanislav] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Lab Studies Econ Sociol, 20 Myasnitskaya Str, Moscow 101000, Russia; [Pashkov, Stanislav] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Dept Econ Sociol, 20 Myasnitskaya Str, Moscow 101000, Russia","HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics)","Pashkov, S (corresponding author), Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Fac Social Sci, 20 Myasnitskaya Str, Moscow 101000, Russia.;Pashkov, S (corresponding author), Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Lab Studies Econ Sociol, 20 Myasnitskaya Str, Moscow 101000, Russia.;Pashkov, S (corresponding author), Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Dept Econ Sociol, 20 Myasnitskaya Str, Moscow 101000, Russia.","spashkov@hse.ru","","","","","","","33","0","0","2","6","NATL RESEARCH UNIV HIGHER SCH ECONOMICS","MOSCOW","SHABOLOVKA, 26, MOSCOW, 119049, RUSSIA","1726-3247","","","J ECON SOCIOL","J.

Employing daily data on gold prices from 2000 to 2019 and on cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) from 2013 to 2019 in a linear and non-linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) framework, we investigate and contrast the hedging effectiveness of gold and bitcoins for equities. This study also evaluates whether hedging potential of gold or cryptocurrency remains equally strong in bearish and bullish conditions of the stock market. Our key findings on stock and gold returns reveal that the effects of gold on the stock market are asymmetric in most of the cases. Negative asymmetry is more likely to occur regardless of stock market conditions. On the other hand, there is very limited evidence showing the meaningful effect of cryptocurrency. The robustness of the ARDL bounds test of co-integration provides evidence for a strong long-run relationship in all cases. Contrary to the existing literature, our results suggest that neither gold nor cryptocurrency acts as a good instrument for hedging in the stock market. Correlations between stock/gold and stock/cryptocurrency pairs are found to be positive in most cases. Our findings imply that adding gold or cryptocurrency to a stock portfolio does not enhance its risk-adjusted return.","[Thampanya, Natthinee] Naresuan Univ, Fac Business Econ & Commun, Tha Pho Subdistrict Tha, Mueang Phitsanu, Thailand; [Nasir, Muhammad Ali] Leeds Beckett Univ, Leeds Business Sch, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Nasir, Muhammad Ali; Toan Luu Duc Huynh] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Toan Luu Duc Huynh] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Chair Behav Finance, Vallendar, Germany","Naresuan University; Leeds Beckett University; Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management","Thampanya, N (corresponding author), Naresuan Univ, Fac Business Econ & Commun, Tha Pho Subdistrict Tha, Mueang Phitsanu, Thailand.","natthineet@nu.ac.th; M.A.Nasir@leedsbeckett.ac.uk; toanhld@ueh.edu.vn","Nasir, Muhammad Ali/I-6252-2019","Nasir, Muhammad Ali/0000-0003-2779-5854; Huynh, Toan Luu Duc/0000-0002-1486-127X","","","","","48","22","22","4","20","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","0040-1625","1873-5509","","TECHNOL FORECAST SOC","Technol.

One of the most used access control models is Attribute-based Access Control, in which access rights are granted to users by evaluating suitable attributes (user attributes, resource attributes, and environment conditions). An important aspect of access control is to guarantee that the identity of the user accessing a service is preserved. In this paper, we deal with this problem and propose a new solution based on a blockchain to ensure that only authorized users can access a service, yet preserving anonymity and unlinkability of their accesses. Moreover, the cooperation among several trusted parties allows the identification of the user accessing a service in case of need.","[Lax, Gianluca; Russo, Antonia] Univ Reggio Calabria, DIIES Dept, Reggio Di Calabria, Italy","","Lax, G (corresponding author), Univ Reggio Calabria, DIIES Dept, Reggio Di Calabria, Italy.","lax@unirc.it; antonia.russo@unirc.it","","","","","","","17","3","3","0","0","ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY PUBLISHING","ROWLAND HEIGHTS","2448 DESIRE AVE, ROWLAND HEIGHTS, CA 91748 USA","1798-2340","","","J ADV INFORM TECHNOL","J.

However, critics fail to distinguish between the resources that are used to secure the blockchain and those that are wasted. In this paper, we introduce a simple mining model and use this model to analyze the consensus protocol's efficiency, while accounting for the heterogeneity of the miners involved. We categorize the resources allocated by the miners as either useful or wasteful, and then use this to introduce a new measure of efficiency. We then demonstrate how this value depends on a set of potential miners and the variation of their marginal costs. Using this model, we then consider the existence of botnets and show how one could affect the security of the network. This analysis indicates that botnets can significantly change the mining landscape and, under certain circumstances, may lead to a dissipation ratio >1.","[Schar, Fabian] Univ Basel, Ctr Innovat Finance, Fac Business & Econ, Basel, Switzerland","University of Basel","Schar, F (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Ctr Innovat Finance, Fac Business & Econ, Basel, Switzerland.","f.schaer@unibas.ch","","","","","","","8","0","0","2","5","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","2624-7852","","","FRONT BLOCKCHAIN","Front.

Given that sustainability is a crucial goal in the design of smart cities nowadays, there are currently no assurances of sustainable cities where cryptocurrency mining is at full scale. Nevertheless, alternative energy sources may come to the rescue in no distant time. In this paper, we contextualize energy-use in smart cities through mining of virtual currencies, in order to predict whether or not smart cities can truly be sustainable if crypto-mining is sustained. An attempt is also made to emphasize the possible ways of reducing energy use and all activities involving digital currencies by seeking to replace Proof of Work (PoW) with improved alternatives.","[Fadeyi, Oluwaseun; Krejcar, Ondrej; Maresova, Petra; Kuca, Kamil; Selamat, Ali] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Ctr Basic & Appl Res, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic; [Fadeyi, Oluwaseun] Univ Trier, Fac Geog & Geosci, Dept Geol, D-54296 Trier, Germany; [Kuca, Kamil; Selamat, Ali] Univ Teknol Malaysia Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Japan Int Inst Technol, Jalan Sultan Yahya Petra, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia; [Brida, Peter] Univ Zilina, Fac Elect Engn & Informat Technol, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Selamat, Ali] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Media & Games Ctr Excellence MagicX, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia","University of Hradec Kralove; Universitat Trier; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; University of Zilina; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia","Krejcar, O (corresponding author), Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Ctr Basic & Appl Res, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic.","phar2kind@gmail.com; ondrej.krejcar@uhk.cz; petra.maresova@uhk.cz; kamil.kuca@uhk.cz; peter.brida@feit.uniza.sk; aselamat@utm.my","Krejcar, Ondrej/A-8639-2008; Fadeyi, Oluwaseun/AAD-2041-2022; Brida, Peter/D-5224-2009; Selamat, Ali/E-9645-2011; Kuca, Kamil/D-1396-2011; Maresova, Petra/L-1743-2017","Krejcar, Ondrej/0000-0002-5992-2574; Fadeyi, Oluwaseun/0000-0001-8369-4471; Brida, Peter/0000-0002-5442-9246; Selamat, Ali/0000-0001-9746-8459; Kuca, Kamil/0000-0001-9664-1109; Maresova, Petra/0000-0002-1218-501X","Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove; Slovak VEGA grant agency [1/0626/19]; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) [20H04]; Malaysia Research University Network (MRUN) [4L876]; Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) under Ministry of Education Malaysia [5F073]","Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove; Slovak VEGA grant agency(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)); Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM); Malaysia Research University Network (MRUN); Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) under Ministry of Education Malaysia","The work and the contribution were mainly supported by project of excellence 2019/2206, Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove.

Firstly, interpretation and characteristics of cryptocurrencies is introduced. Further, main rules of their disclosure in financial statements are analysed and compared not only within three selected countries, but also in view of IAS/IFRS interpretation. Obtained findings suggest that an attitude to cryptocurrencies financial reporting differs among selected countries. While the Czech Republic discloses cryptocurrencies as inventories in the statement of financial position, the Slovak Republic integrates them into short-term financial assets and the Federal Republic of Germany recommends to disclose them as the long-term intangible assets or other assets. Taking account also IAS/IFRS interpretation it can be stated that the Slovak Republic holds different post not only in relation to the rest selected countries, but also to IAS/IFRS that treat cryptocurrencies as intangible assets or inventories. The Czech treatment corresponds to IAS/IFRS interpretation and also the German treatment does not contradict it. The Slovak attitude differs but in some aspects it better corresponds to functioning of cryptocurrencies in practice. Disclosure of cryptocurrencies in the statement of financial position than influences also disclosure of related revenues and expenses in the statement of financial performance.

Due to the way these channels are created, both sides have a certain one-way capacity for making transactions.

The potential uses of Blockchain surpassed digital currency into a wider space that includes the Internet of Things (IoT), security applications and smart embedded systems, among others. As the number of Blockchain users increases, several drawbacks start to emerge, since Blockchains consume excessive amounts of energy to store and manipulate data. Furthermore, the limited scalability nature of Blockchains due to their massive storage requirements might become an issue. To improve the overall performance, several challenges in the current Blockchain structure should be tackled. This paper presents a hybrid system architecture that combines the distributed nature of Blockchains with the centralized feature of servers. Users will connect to servers via personal Blockchains, while servers will share a chain of Blockchains to ensure integrity and security. This will significantly decrease the storage requirements of end-users and enhance the scalability of networks. Businesses will highly benefit from this proposed structure, since it creates a reliable scalable business model.","[Marar, Hazem W.] Princess Sumaya Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Amman, Jordan; [Marar, Rosana W.] Princess Sumaya Univ Technol, Dept Comp Graph & Animat, Amman, Jordan","","Marar, HW (corresponding author), Princess Sumaya Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Amman, Jordan.","h.marar@psut.edu.jo; r.marar@psut.edu.jo","","","","","","","25","0","0","0","0","Princess Sumaya Univ & SRSF","Amman","Princess Sumaya University for Technology (PSUT), Khalil Saket Street 118, Amman, JORDAN","2413-9351","2415-1076","","JORDAN J COMPUT INFO","Jordanian J.

If additionally a block satisfies H(B) <= T 2(-mu), it is called a mu-superblock. Superblocks play an important role in the construction of compact blockchain proofs which allows the compression of PoW blockchains into so-called Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs). These certificates are essential for the construction of superlight clients, which are blockchain wallets that can synchronize exponentially faster than traditional SPV clients. In this work, we measure the distribution of superblocks in the Bitcoin blockchain. We find that the superblock distribution within the blockchain follows expectation, hence we empirically verify that the distribution of superblocks within the Bitcoin blockchain has not been adversarially biased. NIPoPoWs require that each block in a blockchain points to a sample of previous blocks in the blockchain. These pointers form a data structure called the interlink. We give efficient ways to store the interlink data structure. Repeated superblock references within an interlink can be omitted with no harm to security. Hence, it is more efficient to store a set of superblocks rather than a list. We show that, in honest executions, this simple observation reduces the number of superblock references by approximately a half in expectation. We then verify our theoretical result by measuring the improvement over existing blockchains in terms of the interlink sizes (which we improve by 79%) and the sizes of succinct NIPoPoWs (which we improve by 25%). As such, we show that deduplication allows superlight clients to synchronize 25% faster.","[Karantias, Kostis] Univ Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece; [Kiayias, Aggelos] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Zindros, Dionysis] Univ Athens, Athens, Greece; [Kiayias, Aggelos; Zindros, Dionysis] IOHK, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","University of Ioannina; University of Edinburgh; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens","Zindros, D (corresponding author), Univ Athens, Athens, Greece.","dionyziz@gmail.com","","","","","","","22","2","2","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","2198-7246","2198-7254","978-3-030-37110-4; 978-3-030-37109-8","SPR PROC BUS ECON","","","2020","","","","","","","77","91","","10.1007/978-3-030-37110-4_6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-37110-4_6","","","15","Business; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics; Computer Science; Mathematics","BR9FH","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000675370400005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Each node in the Blockchain network keeps the entire data, which not only waste storage, but also requires a vast amount of computationwhich iswasteful and scales poorly. The SPV (simplified payment verification) node simplifies node storage, but decentralization, the most important feature of Blockchain, is compromised. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel enhanced lightweight node called ESPV (Enhanced SPV) based on the analysis of the characteristics of Blockchain data. ESPV nodes label blocks as new and old, and keep all the new blocks while storing partial old blocks according their capacity. A hierarchical block partition routing table is established to ensure data availability when ESPV nodes access old blocks they do not have. An ESPV node has all the functions of a full node to ensure the decentralization and stability of a Blockchain system.","[Zhao, Yulong; Niu, Baoning; Li, Peng; Fan, Xing] Taiyuan Univ Technol, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China","Taiyuan University of Technology","Niu, BN (corresponding author), Taiyuan Univ Technol, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China.","zyl34389@gmail.com; niubaoning@tyut.edu.cn; imleep@163.com; fanxing0045@link.tyut.edu.cn","","","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB1401000]; Key Laboratory of Digital Rights Services","National Key R&D Program of China; Key Laboratory of Digital Rights Services","Thisworkwas supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2017YFB1401000, and in part by the Key Laboratory of Digital Rights Services.","","17","0","0","2","9","SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD","SINGAPORE","152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE","1865-0929","1865-0937","978-981-15-2777-7; 978-981-15-2776-0","COMM COM INF SC","","","2020","1156","","","","","","137","149","","10.1007/978-981-15-2777-7_12","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-2777-7_12","","","13","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR5RE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000656861800012","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Ring Confidential Transaction (RingCT) protocol is widely used in anonymous cryptocurrencies (e.g. Monero) to hide transaction information. However, its expensive computing and storage costs slow down the performance of the system. In this work, we propose a high-efficient RingCT protocol which is called aggregation ring confidential transaction (ARCT). In our protocol, we build a compact aggregation proof for multiple accounts of the sender, which enables our protocol to linearly shorten the signature size compared to other protocols. In addition, in order to further protect the privacy information, we first implement hiding the amount of the sender's accounts. Our protocol can provide cryptocurrencies with better privacy protection and lower resource cost. Besides, it does not require a trust setting. For a typical n=2 input transaction with the ring size of 128, the signature size of our protocol is 93% less than it used in the original protocol. ARCT build on the techniques of inner product optimization algorithm and cryptographic accumulators. We show that our underlying algorithm satisfies the security under the random oracle model.","[Duan, Junke; Gu, Lize; Zheng, Shihui] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Cyberspace Secur, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China","Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications","Duan, JK (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Cyberspace Secur, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.","duanjunke@bupt.edu.cn","","duan, junke/0000-0001-6457-8600","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB080301]","National Key Research and Development Program of China","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFB080301.","","34","3","3","2","15","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","198118","198130","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3034333","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3034333","","","13","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","OR9HD","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000589775700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Blockchain platforms are currently being used across the world in several government processes and business domains, for their unique characteristics. Even though blockchain shows potentials in its ability to provide a limitless number of inventive commercial trading, payments, government, healthcare, military and other critical applications, they face a security weakness on their recent prominent breaches of exchanges. Hence, there remain major security issues that are essential to be overcome before blockchain adopts the mainstream. And currently, this technology relies on hardware security modules (HSM) for the management and protection of their digital keys. The HSM generates key pairs, has secure storage and can off-load cryptographic operations from the entire system. But recently, FPGAs are preferred for hardware realization of algorithms considering its flexibility, low cost and long-term maintenance. It also has an advantage of reconfigurable or reprogrammable hardware design whenever new security or adaptation of an algorithm is required to support higher security levels. The paper presents a review of hardware security modules and proposed to enhance the scalability and reliability of the HSM by implementing it with the silicon-based secure module. Integrating PUF technology into the chip for storing and securing encryption or private keys, its security level can also be improved.","[Singh, Lukram Dhanachandra; Meher, Preetisudha] NIT Arunachal Pradesh, ECE Dept, Yupia, India","National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Arunachal Pradesh","Singh, LD (corresponding author), NIT Arunachal Pradesh, ECE Dept, Yupia, India.","dhana.lukram0@gmail.com; preetisudhal@gmail.com","","Dhanachandra Singh, Lukram/0000-0003-2416-3296","","","","","14","0","0","2","3","SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD","SINGAPORE","152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE","2194-5357","2194-5365","978-981-15-1451-7; 978-981-15-1450-0","ADV INTELL SYST COMP","","","2020","1040","","","","","","449","456","","10.1007/978-981-15-1451-7_48","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-1451-7_48","","","8","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR5IZ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000655611800045","View Full Record in Web of Science"

As the blockchain could replace traditional intermediaries, the structure of the tourism sector in the future has been discussed widely in the news. This article aims to conceptually examine the implications of blockchain along the value system in the tourism industry in order to identify its potential benefits. To address this, the methodology follows a content analysis of 175 news articles on the topic of blockchain and tourism, which are analysed through a qualitative news analysis and the method of GABEK (R). The results imply blockchain applications along with the whole tourism value system, while it became apparent that traveling is streamlined through the transformation of time-intensive back-stage processes and thus offers extra value for travellers. Through its novelty in the academic discourse, the paper makes obstacles and regulations a subject of discussion, too.","[Thees, Hannes] Catholic Univ Eichstaett Ingolstadt, Chair Tourism, Ctr Entrepreneurship, Pater Philipp Jeningen Pl 2, D-85072 Eichstaett Ingolstadt, Germany; [Erschbamer, Greta] Ctr Adv Studies, Eurac Res, Bolzano, Italy; [Pechlaner, Harald] Catholic Univ Eichstaett Ingolstadt, Chair Tourism, Ctr Entrepreneurship, Eurac Res,Ctr Adv Studies, Bolzano, Italy","European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano; European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano","Thees, H (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Eichstaett Ingolstadt, Chair Tourism, Ctr Entrepreneurship, Pater Philipp Jeningen Pl 2, D-85072 Eichstaett Ingolstadt, Germany.","Hannes.thees@ku.de","Thees, Hannes/GYV-2576-2022","Thees, Hannes/0000-0002-4200-5796; Erschbamer, Greta/0000-0001-8186-182X","","","","","73","14","14","5","14","VARNA UNIV MANAGEMENT-VUM","VARNA","13 A OBORISHTE STR, VARNA, 9000, BULGARIA","1994-7658","1314-0817","","EUR J TOUR RES","Eur.

Among others, fair and true disclosure of cryptocurrencies in financial statements, is influenced by valuation techniques used. That is why our paper analyses and compares attitudes to this problem within examined sample of selected European countries. This paper loosely follows our previous paper dedicated to disclosure of cryptocurrencies in financial statements as interpretation and disclosure of cryptocurrencies influence naturally valuation bases used for accounting measurement. We take into consideration also IAS/IFRS view in outline. Firstly, interpretation of cryptocurrencies in selected countries is discussed briefly. Further, valuation bases and basic valuation rules used for cryptocurrencies pricing are analysed and compared. Obtained findings suggest that equally as a view on cryptocurrency interpretation and disclosure in financial statements differs among traced EU countries, also valuation bases used for cryptocurrencies measurement differ. The Czech Republic that treats cryptocurrency as inventory uses cost of acquisition for its initial evaluation in accounting. Cost of acquisition encompass also related expenses such as exchange fees. Similar attitude holds the Federal Republic of Germany that interprets cryptocurrency as either the long-term intangible asset or other receivables. It evaluates cryptocurrencies by cost of acquisition defined similarly as in the Czech Republic. Different stand takes the Slovak Republic that integrates cryptocurrencies into the short-term financial assets and evaluates them by fair value. This stand differs also from interpretation of IAS/IFRS that include cryptocurrencies either in inventories or in the long-term intangible assets and recommend to evaluate them initially by cost of acquisition.","[Vodakova, Jana; Foltyn, Jiri] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic","Masaryk University Brno","Vodakova, J (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic.","Jana.Vodakova@mail.muni.cz; Jiri.Foltyn@mail.muni.cz","","","","","","","12","0","0","0","3","INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA","NORRISTOWN","34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA","","","978-0-9998551-4-0","","","","2020","","","","","","","15529","15534","","","","","","6","Business; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Management","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics","BR6JR","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000661489806047","View Full Record in Web of Science"

At present, cryptocurrencies are the most advanced application of public blockchains that promise benefits such as a universal means of payment and minimal fees through the removal of intermediaries. In the tourism industry, though many tourism vendors have been accepting cryptocurrencies and the potential of using cryptocurrencies in travel-related consumption has been intensively documented, existing knowledge about travellers' intention to use cryptocurrencies for payment purposes is limited. Traditional models do not account for the idiosyncrasies of cryptocurrencies and are therefore less appropriate to foster the understanding of travellers' adoption of travel-related payments. To fill this knowledge gap, an exploratory study was conducted with 161 travellers from the Asia-Pacific region who have previously consumed travel-related services with cryptocurrencies. Their previous usage experiences are analysed and reported. Through harnessing the correspondence analysis, several technological contingency factors were identified, as well as positive and negative perceptual antecedents. Additionally, their levels of satisfaction and intention to re-use the technology in future trips were investigated. Based on these findings, several propositions are suggested for guiding future research on travellers' cryptocurrency adoption in the travel and tourism contexts.","[Treiblmaier, Horst] Modul Univ Vienna, Dept Int Management, Vienna, Austria; Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Hotel & Tourism Management, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kwok, Andrei O.

Ideally, the rules of the protocol should ensure that miners maximize their gains if they follow a default strategy, which consists on appending blocks only to the longest branch of the tree, called the blockchain. Our goal is to understand under which circumstances are miners encouraged to follow the default strategy. Unfortunately, most of the existing models work with simplified payoff functions, without considering the possibility that rewards decrease over time because of the game rules (like in Bitcoin), nor integrating the fact that a miner naturally prefers to be paid earlier than later (the economic concept of discount). In order to integrate these factors, we consider a more general model where issues such as economic discount and decreasing rewards can be set as parameters of an infinite stochastic game. In this model, we study the limit situation in which a miner does not receive a full reward for a block if it stops being in the blockchain. We show that if rewards are not decreasing, then miners do not have incentives to create new branches, no matter how high their computational power is. On the other hand, when working with decreasing rewards similar to those in Bitcoin, we show that miners have an incentive to create such branches. Nevertheless, this incentive only occurs when a miner controls a proportion of the computational power which is close to half of the computational power of the entire network.","[Arenas, Marcelo; Reutter, Juan; Ugarte, Martin; Vrgoc, Domagoj] PUC Chile, Santigo, Chile; [Arenas, Marcelo; Reutter, Juan; Ugarte, Martin; Vrgoc, Domagoj] IMFD Chile, Santigo, Chile; [Toussaint, Etienne] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Vial, Francisco] ProtonMail, Santiago, Chile; [Vial, Francisco] IMFD Chile, Santiago, Chile","University of Edinburgh","Arenas, M (corresponding author), PUC Chile, Santigo, Chile.;Arenas, M (corresponding author), IMFD Chile, Santigo, Chile.","marenas@ing.puc.cl; jreutter@ing.puc.cl; etienne.toussaint@ed.ac.uk; martin@martinugarte.com; fvial@pm.me; dvrgoc@ing.puc.cl","Reutter, Juan/D-1296-2014","Reutter, Juan/0000-0002-2186-0312","Millennium Institute for Foundational Research on Data, Chile","Millennium Institute for Foundational Research on Data, Chile","Millennium Institute for Foundational Research on Data, Chile","","24","1","1","1","9","SCHLOSS DAGSTUHL,  LEIBNIZ CENTER INFORMATICS","WADEM","OKTAVIE-ALLEE, WADEM, 66687, GERMANY","1868-8969","","978-3-95977-140-5","LEIBNIZ INT PR INFOR","","","2020","154","","","","","","","","54","10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2020.54","http://dx.doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2020.54","","","16","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Mathematics","BO6NS","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000521377300054","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Miners are distributed entities responsible for validating the transactions in the network and producing and verifying new blocks of confirmed transactions. In addition, they are responsible for keeping the protocol's integrity, protecting it against the double-spending problem. Miners are rewarded when they add new blocks to the blockchain. The reward consists of fresh coins created after adding a new block as well as the fees collected from the transactions inside the added block. The amount of new coins generated with new blocks is diminishing by the protocol over time. As such, the significance of collected fees is increasing for the miners. A recent trend in large mining pools is to allow miners to select transactions in the block they aim to mine. Allowing miners to select transactions increases transparency via discretization and also helps to avoid conflict of interest with the mining pool managers. Assuming that forming blocks is in miners' hands, miners should have a strategy to maintain transactions inside the block in a way to maximize their collected fees. The mining process is a random process that is progress free. That is, a miner can update the transactions inside the block without any impact on its chance of succeeding in adding the block. Given that transactions with higher fees might arrive at any time in an online manner, it is profitable for a miner to refresh its block during the mining process. In this paper, we study the impact of refreshing blocks via an experimental analysis on real-world data from Bitcoin on a controlled environment that is carefully tuned to match the real world. Our results indicate that refreshing blocks is essential for increasing miners' collected fees, and overlooking it will have a significant impact on miners' revenues.","[dos Santos, Saulo; Kamali, Shahin; Thulasiram, Ruppa K.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Comp Sci, Winnipeg, MB, Canada","University of Manitoba","dos Santos, S (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Comp Sci, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.","dossants@cs.umanitoba.ca; kamalis@cs.umanitoba.ca; tulsi@cs.umanitoba.ca","","","University of Manitoba; GETS funding Scholarship from the Faculty of Graduate Studies, University of Manitoba; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Canada","University of Manitoba; GETS funding Scholarship from the Faculty of Graduate Studies, University of Manitoba; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","The first author acknowledges the University of Manitoba Graduate Fellowship and GETS funding Scholarship from the Faculty of Graduate Studies, University of Manitoba.

Such a vision requires seamless security, data privacy, authentication and robustness against attacks. These attributes can be introduced by blockchain, a distributed ledger that maintains an immutable log of network transactions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review on how to remodel blockchain to the specific IoT needs in order to develop Blockchain based IoT (BIoT) applications and aim to shape a coherent picture of the current state-of-the-art efforts in this direction. After describing the basic characteristics and requirements of IoT, evolution of blockchain is presented. In this regard, we start with the fundamental working principles of blockchain and how such systems achieve auditability, security and decentralization.

In recent years, there has been a trend in designing proof of stake (PoS) based consensus protocols. Unfortunately, PoS based consensus protocols are inherently not secure and are vulnerable to long range attacks. Thus PoS based blockchains have the potential risk of being forked with a minimal cost for double spending. In this paper, we propose a PoS protocol that is secure against long range attack based double spending. The security is achieved using secure randomness beacons generated by tamper proof hardware modules.","[Wang, Yongge] UNC Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Sun, Jingwen; Wang, Xin; Wei, Yunchuan; Wu, Hao] Sperax, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yu, Zhou] UC Los Angeles, Math, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Chu, Gillian] Univ Calif Berkeley, EECS, Berkeley, CA USA","University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Berkeley","Wang, YG (corresponding author), UNC Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.","yonwang@uncc.edu; yuzhou87@g.ucla.edu; gillichu@berkeley.edu","","","","","","","7","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2159-4228","","978-1-7281-8695-5","IEEE CONF COMPUT","","","2020","","","","","","","574","579","","","","","","6","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BQ4QE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000593830400096","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A consensus mechanism is a foundational component of a blockchain-based system. The existing mechanisms rare achieve high efficiency and high scalability simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a hybrid consensus mechanism, a delegation based scalable byzantine false tolerant (DSBFT), which combines PoW and BFT to achieve a well-balanced between efficiency and scalability.

This entails downloading and verifying all blocks, taking hours and requiring gigabytes of bandwidth and storage. Hence, clients with limited resources cannot verify transactions independently without trusting full nodes. Bitcoin and Ethereum offer light clients known as simplified payment verification (SPV) clients, that can verify the chain by downloading only the block headers. Unfortunately, the storage and bandwidth requirements of SPV clients still increase linearly with the chain length. For example, as of July 2019, an SPV client in Ethereum needs to download and store about 4 GB of data. Recently, Kiayias et al. proposed a solution known as noninteractive proofs of proof-of-work (NIPoPoW) that allows a light client to download and store only a polylogarithmic number of block headers in expectation. Unfortunately, NIPoPoWs are succinct only as long as no adversary influences the honest chain, and can only be used in chains with fixed block difficulty, contrary to most cryptocurrencies which adjust block difficulty frequently according to the network hashrate. We introduce FlyClient, a novel transaction verification light client for chains of variable difficulty. FlyClient is efficient both asymptotically and practically and requires downloading only a logarithmic number of block headers while storing only a single block header between executions. Using an optimal probabilistic block sampling protocol and Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) commitments, FlyClient overcomes the limitations of NIPoPoWs and generates shorter proofs over all measured parameters. In Ethereum, FlyClient achieves a synchronization proof size of less than 500 KB which is roughly 6,600x smaller than SPV proofs. We finally discuss how FlyClient can be deployed with minimal changes to the existing cryptocurrencies via an uncontentious velvet fork.","[Bunz, Benedikt] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kiffer, Lucianna] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Luu, Loi] Kyber Network, Singapore, Singapore; [Zamani, Mahdi] Visa Res, Foster City, CA USA","Stanford University; Northwestern University","Bunz, B (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.","benedikt@cs.stanford.edu; kiffer.l@husky.neu.edu; loiluu@kyber.network; mzamani@visa.com","","","NSF; SGF; ONR; Simons Foundation; ZCash Foundation; Visa Research","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); SGF; ONR(Office of Naval Research); Simons Foundation; ZCash Foundation; Visa Research","We thank the anonymous CCS reviewers for pointing out Bahack style attacks and problems with the security proof in a previous version of the paper.

These characteristics made the blockchain technology attractive not only for law-abiding individuals, but also for criminals. For a long time most legal scholars in Russia and abroad viewed the sphere of blockchain as the sphere of criminal actions connected with illegal trade in goods, services or materials, whose circulation is limited or forbidden (narcotic substances, arms, pornography, etc.), and with laundering of illegal gains or financing terrorism. Current global trends in combating cybercrime leave no doubt that the ideas of the invulnerability of the blockchain net to unsanctioned access through the modifications of codes, the use of malware, the invulnerability to thefts or other property crimes against users or the third party are rather utopian. The legislative practice of recent years shows that these trends have not yet been recognized in our country. The research presented in this article consisted in the analysis of property crimes in the sphere of blockchain that are most common in the global virtual space, including in its Russian segment. The author describes the options for the qualification of such criminal actions provided by the current legislation and used in Russian court practice. The author also identifies the cases when the texts of some Articles of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation do not match the level of public danger and the essence of criminal infringements against property committed with the use of information technologies, including the sphere of blockchain. A number of suggestions on improving the texts of Art. 158, 159.6, 165, 272 and 273 of the CC of the RF are presented.","[Mkrtchian, Sona M.] Volgograd State Univ, Chair Criminal Law, Volgograd, Russia","Volgograd State University (VOLSU)","Mkrtchian, SM (corresponding author), Volgograd State Univ, Chair Criminal Law, Volgograd, Russia.","s.mkrtchian1992@volsu.ru","Mkrtchian, Sona/ABA-6578-2021","","RFBR [20-011-00823]","RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR))","This research was funded by the RFBR, Project number 20-011-00823","","24","1","1","3","8","BAIKAL STATE UNIV","IRKUTSK","11 LENIN ST, IRKUTSK, 664003, RUSSIA","2500-4255","2500-1442","","RUSS J CRIMINOL","Russ.

To deal with the confidential problem, some current cryptocurrencies adopt confidential transactions to hide the details in proofs. Among all confidential transaction implementations, Bulletproof is the most efficient approach without a trusted setup. In this paper, we analyze Bulletproof's design and show that the computation cost can be further reduced. Based on our analysis, we propose Shellproof, which is only half of the computation cost of Bulletproof.

The superiority of hybrid models to soft- and hard-computed models is further assessed through a 'horse race' and trading performance, as well as through fine-tuning of the algorithms.","[Chevallier, Julien] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France; [Chevallier, Julien] Univ Paris 08, LED, 2 Rue Liberte, F-93526 St Denis, France; [Zhu, Bangzhu] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lyuyuan] Univ Melbourne, Sch Math & Stat, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia","IPAG Business School; Universite Paris-VIII; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Melbourne","Chevallier, J (corresponding author), IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France.;Chevallier, J (corresponding author), Univ Paris 08, LED, 2 Rue Liberte, F-93526 St Denis, France.;Zhu, BZ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.","julien.chevallier@ipag.fr; wpzbz@126.com","","Zhang, Lyuyuan/0000-0001-9562-7161","","","","","57","4","4","2","6","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0927-7099","1572-9974","","COMPUT ECON","Comput.

Open access to resources, such as research journals, publications, articles in periodicals etc. is restricted to retain their authenticity and integrity, as well as to track and record their usage in the form of citations. This gives the author of the resource his fair share of credibility in the community, but this may not be the case with open educational resources such as lecture notes, presentations, test papers, reports etc. that are produced and used internally within an organisation or multiple organisations. This calls for the need to build a system that stores a permanent and immutable repository of these resources in addition to keeping a track record of who utilises them. Keeping in view the above-mentioned problem in mind, the present research attempts to explore how a Blockchain based system called Block-ED can be used to help the educational community manage their resources in a way to avoid any unauthorised manipulations or alterations to the documents, as well as recognise how this system can provide an innovative method of giving credibility to the creator of the resource whenever it is utilised.","[Irshad, Shareen] SZABIST, Dept Comp Sci, Dubai Campus, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Brohi, Muhammad Nawaz] Bath Spa Univ, Ras Al Khaima, U Arab Emirates; [Soomro, Tariq Rahim] Inst Business Management, Coll Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Karachi, Pakistan","Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science & Technology","Soomro, TR (corresponding author), Inst Business Management, Coll Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Karachi, Pakistan.","shareen.irshad1991@gmail.com; mnbrohi@bathspa.ae; tariq.soomro@iobm.edu.pk","Soomro, Tariq Rahim/E-7462-2016; Brohi, Muhammad Nawaz/K-4669-2016","Soomro, Tariq Rahim/0000-0002-7119-0644; Brohi, Muhammad Nawaz/0000-0003-0310-1782","","","","","36","3","3","1","3","SCIENDO","WARSAW","BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND","2255-8683","2255-8691","","APPL COMPUT SYST","Appl.

These digital currencies have garnered significant interest from investment banks and portfolio managers as a potential option to diversify the financial risk from investing in other assets. This interest has also extended to the general public who have seen cryptocurrencies as a way of making a quick profit. This paper provides a first insight into the applicability of high frequency momentum trading strategies for cryptocurrencies. We implemented two variations of a signal-based momentum trading strategy: (i) a time series method; (ii) a cross sectional method. These strategies were tested on a selection of seven of the largest cryptocurrencies ranked by market capitalization. The results show that there exists potential for the momentum strategy to be used successfully for cryptocurrency trading in a high frequency setting. A comparison with a passive portfolio strategy is proposed, which shows abnormal returns when compared with the momentum strategies. Furthermore, the robustness of our results are checked through the application of the momentum strategies other sample periods. We also compare the performances of the signal-based momentum strategies with returns-based versions of the strategies. It is shown that the signal-based strategy outperforms the returns-based strategy. However, there appears to be no single parameterization of the signal-based strategies that can generate the greatest cumulative return over all sample periods.","[Chu, Jeffrey] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Stat, Madrid, Spain; [Chan, Stephen] Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Math & Stat, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Zhang, Yuanyuan] Univ Manchester, Sch Math, Manchester, Lancs, England","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; American University of Sharjah; University of Manchester","Chan, S (corresponding author), Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Math & Stat, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.","schan@aus.edu","Chan, Stephen/AAE-2466-2020","Chan, Stephen/0000-0002-2312-2137","","","","","37","11","11","2","22","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0275-5319","1878-3384","","RES INT BUS FINANC","Res.

New findings indicate that mega-size cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ripple exhibit return-volatility behaviour whereby volatility changes in their markets increase rather by a response to positive shocks than by a response to negative shocks. Akin to safe net assets, particularly gold, the inverse asymmetric reactions of the cryptocurrency markets position them distinctively from the existing emerging markets, suggestive that the digital assets stand to offer potentials beyond being diversifiers.","[Omane-Adjepong, Maurice; Alagidede, Imhotep Paul] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, 2 St Davids Pl, ZA-2193 Johannesburg, South Africa","University of Witwatersrand","Omane-Adjepong, M (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, 2 St Davids Pl, ZA-2193 Johannesburg, South Africa.","omane.maurice@gcuc.edu.gh","Omane-Adjepong, Maurice/AFS-8084-2022; Omane-Adjepong, Maurice/AAW-9402-2021","Omane-Adjepong, Maurice/0000-0003-4666-7508","","","","","21","0","0","1","3","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0812-0439","1759-3441","","ECON PAP","Econ.

We propose a novel permissionless blockchain protocol OHIE which explicitly aims for simplicity. OHIE composes as many parallel instances of Bitcoin's original (and simple) backbone protocol as needed to achieve excellent throughput. We formally prove the safety and liveness properties of OHIE. We demonstrate its performance with a prototype implementation and large-scale experiments with up to 50; 000 nodes. In our experiments, OHIE achieves linear scaling with available bandwidth, providing about 4- 10Mbps transaction throughput (under 8-20Mbps per-node available bandwidth configurations) and at least about 20x better decentralization over prior works.","[Yu, Haifeng; Nikolic, Ivica; Hou, Ruomu; Saxena, Prateek] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Comp Sci, Singapore, Singapore","National University of Singapore","Yu, HF (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Comp Sci, Singapore, Singapore.","haifeng@comp.nus.edu.sg; inikolic@nus.edu.sg; houruomu@comp.nus.edu.sg; prateeks@comp.nus.edu.sg","","","Crystal Center at National University of Singapore","Crystal Center at National University of Singapore","We thank Hung Dang, Seth Gilbert, Aquinas Hobor, Ilya Sergey, Shruti Tople, and Muoi Tran for their helpful feedbacks on this work.

But further analyses of risks raise questions, even abstracting from expected returns. GARCH-based measures of dynamic XBT volatility and covariance suggest that optimal weights change over time. Also, quantile regressions indicate that conditional XBT returns with respect to the S&P 500 are modestly positively skewed. Yet benevolent symmetry is hardly stable or consistent along the distribution. Spectral analysis shows that the XBT volatility primarily owes to higher-frequency cycles. Nonetheless, XBT betas are substantially greater, and notably positive, over longer cycles compared with shorter cycles, which implies that XBT has been a much less effective strategic hedge. Dynamic principal components analysis indicates that individual coins' exposures to the crypto market factor have likely increased meaningfully enough over time to diminish diversification benefits.","[Durham, J.

Despite its well known use, the mechanism has not been previously formally studied as a primitive. In this paper, we put forth the first cryptographic definition of what a proof-of-burn protocol is. It consists of two functions: First, a function which generates a cryptocurrency address. When a user sends money to this address, the money is irrevocably destroyed. Second, a verification function which checks that an address is really unspendable. We propose the following properties for burn protocols. Unspendability, which mandates that an address which verifies correctly as a burn address cannot be used for spending; binding, which allows associating metadata with a particular burn; and uncensorability, which mandates that a burn address is indistinguishable from a regular cryptocurrency address. Our definition captures all previously known proof-of-burn protocols. Next, we design a novel construction for burning which is simple and flexible, making it compatible with all existing popular cryptocurrencies. We prove our scheme is secure in the Random Oracle model. We explore the application of destroying value in a legacy cryptocurrency to bootstrap a new one. The user burns coins in the source blockchain and subsequently creates a proof-of-burn, a short string proving that the burn took place, which she then submits to the destination blockchain to be rewarded with a corresponding amount. The user can use a standard wallet to conduct the burn without requiring specialized software, making our scheme user friendly. We propose burn verification mechanisms with different security guarantees, noting that the target blockchain miners do not necessarily need to monitor the source blockchain. Finally, we implement the verification of Bitcoin burns as an Ethereum smart contract and experimentally measure that the gas costs needed for verification are as low as standard Bitcoin transaction fees, illustrating that our scheme is practical.","[Karantias, Kostis; Zindros, Dionysis] IOHK, Athens, Greece; [Zindros, Dionysis] Univ Athens, Athens, Greece; [Kiayias, Aggelos] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Kiayias, Aggelos] IOHK, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; University of Edinburgh","Karantias, K (corresponding author), IOHK, Athens, Greece.","kostis.karantias@iohk.io; akiayias@inf.ed.ac.uk; dionyziz@di.uoa.gr","","","","","","","29","25","26","1","2","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-51280-4; 978-3-030-51279-8","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2020","12059","","","","","","523","540","","10.1007/978-3-030-51280-4_28","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51280-4_28","","","18","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS3NK","","Green Accepted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000713581800027","View Full Record in Web of Science"

IoT domain is one of such applications, which can utilize cryptocurrencies for micropayments without compromising their payment privacy. However, long confirmation times of transactions and relatively high fees hinder the adoption of cryptoccurency based micro-payments. The payment channel networks is one of the proposed solutions to address these issue where nodes establish payment channels among themselves without writing on blockchain. IoT devices can benefit from such payment networks as long as they are capable of sustaining their overhead. Payment channel networks pose unique characteristics as far as the routing problem is concerned. Specifically, they should stay balanced to have a sustainable network for maintaining payments for longer times, which is crucial for IoT devices once they are deployed. In this paper, we present a payment channel network design that aims to keep the channels balanced by using a common weight policy across the network. We additionally propose using multi point connections to nodes for each IoT device for unbalanced payment scenarios. The experiment results show that we can keep the channels in the network more equally balanced compared to the minimal fee approach. In addition, multiple connections from IoT devices to nodes increase the success ratio significantly.","[Mercan, Suat; Erdin, Enes; Akkaya, Kemal] Florida Int Univ, Dept Elec & Comp Engn, Miami, FL 33174 USA","State University System of Florida; Florida International University","Mercan, S (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Elec & Comp Engn, Miami, FL 33174 USA.","smercan@fiu.edu; eerdi001@fiu.edu; kakkaya@fiu.edu","Erdin, Enes/AAZ-4970-2021","Erdin, Enes/0000-0003-2979-8143","National Science Foundation [NSF-CNS-1663051]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This study was partially funded by the National Science Foundation under award number NSF-CNS-1663051.","","15","1","1","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2164-7038","","978-1-7281-7440-2","IEEE INT CONF COMM","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BQ5SJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000607199300250","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We introduce models of verifiable delay functions (VDF) related to a clock and non-interactive timestamping in the UC-framework. These are used to present a secure construction that provides improvements over previous concrete constructions. Namely, timestamps forged by the adversary are now limited to a certain time-window that depends only on the adversary's ability to compute VDFs more quickly and on the length of corruption.

The results show that despite sharing some common characteristics, the cryptocurrencies do not reveal any short- and long-term stochastic trends with exchange rates and/or equity returns. The dynamics of each cryptocurrency with the Chinese Yuan appears to be more turbulent than that with the other exchange rates. Each cryptocurrency appears to follow its own trend in the global financial market and is independent of the exchange rates or the global stock markets, thus making them suitable for inclusion in global investment portfolios. Design/methodology/approach The cryptocurrencies examined are Bitcoin, Dash, Ethereum, Monero, Stellar and XRP. In addition, data were collected on major exchange rates with respect to the US dollar, namely, the euro, British pound, Japanese yen and Chinese Yuan. Finally, the following major stock market indices were selected: SP500, DAX, DJIA, CAC, FTSE, NIKKEI, Hang Seng and Shanghai. The study applied vector autoregressive (VAR) model and Engle's (2002) dynamic conditional correlation generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (DCC-GARCH) specification. Findings First, it was found that cryptocurrencies do not interact with each other because their correlations are weak and do not share a common long-run path; thus they are not cointegrated. Second, impulse response analysis from the VAR models indicate different reactions of each cryptocurrency to both exchange rate and equity shocks and that cryptocurrencies appear to be isolated from market-driven shocks. Third, the ups and downs in the cryptocurrencies' dynamic conditional correlations (from the DCC-GARCH models) indicate that all cryptocurrencies were susceptible to speculative attacks and market events. Research limitations/implications This paper examines the dynamic linkages among the most important cryptocurrencies with major exchange rates and equity markets and, to the best of the authors' knowledge, is the first paper to do so. Thus, interested market agents would gain valuable insights as to whether this new form of asset might be used for conducting monetary policies and portfolio construction on a global setting. Originality/value The paper contributes to the scant literature on the dynamic linkages among major cryptocurrencies and global financial assets. In general, given the differential relationships of each crypto with the equity markets, one could infer that they represent a decent short-run investment vehicle within a well-diversified, global asset portfolio (as they may increase the returns and reduce the overall risk of the portfolio).","[Kostika, Eleftheria] Bank Greece, Athens, Greece; [Laopodis, Nikiforos T.] Univ Baltimore, Dept Finance, Merrick Sch Business, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA","European Central Bank; Bank of Greece; University System of Maryland; University of Baltimore","Laopodis, NT (corresponding author), Univ Baltimore, Dept Finance, Merrick Sch Business, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA.","ekostika@bankofgreece.gr; nlaopodis@ubalt.edu","","","","","","","41","15","15","3","13","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1086-7376","1755-6791","","STUD ECON FINANC","Stud.

The two types of permissioned blockchains are private blockchains, each consisting of one server and multiple users, and consortium blockchains, which consist of groups of private blockchains. However, a blockchain has privacy issues, such as user tracking and inference. Therefore, cryptography should be applied for user privacy in a blockchain. There is a lot of research on anonymous protocols for privacy in a blockchain. In this paper, we provide a scheme for user management, i.e., identification and authorization, in a permissioned blockchain. We also propose an anonymous protocol with user identification and transaction linking capabilities provided by the private server, strictly to solve privacy concerns.","[Ra, Gyeongjin; Lee, Imyeong] Soonchunhyang Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Asan 31538, South Korea; [Seo, Deahee] Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Marietta, GA 30060 USA; [Bhuiyan, Md Zakirul Alam] Fordham Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Sci, Bronx, NY 10458 USA","Soonchunhyang University; University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University; Fordham University","Lee, I (corresponding author), Soonchunhyang Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Asan 31538, South Korea.","rababi@sch.ac.kr; dseo1@kennesaw.edu; m.bhuiyan.dr@ieee.org; imylee@sch.ac.kr","","Lee, Im Yeong/0000-0002-8856-0103","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2019R1A2C1085718]; Soonchunhyang University Research Fund","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) - Ministry of Education; Soonchunhyang University Research Fund","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education(NRF-2019R1A2C1085718) and was supported by the Soonchunhyang University Research Fund.","","47","2","2","3","21","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2079-9292","","ELECTRONICS-SWITZ","Electronics","AUG","2020","9","8","","","","","","","1183","10.3390/electronics9081183","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics9081183","","","22","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Physics","NL8HT","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000567650600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This provides difficulties when state changes many times per block interval. Hash-Mark-Set (HMS) alleviates this problem by enabling READ-UNCOMMITTED transactions for state variables. However, the current HMS implementation relies on a sequential algorithm and is susceptible to redundant calculations. As modern processors rely more heavily on parallel algorithms to leverage multiple cores for speedup, sequential algorithms see less benefit from hardware improvements. This paper proposes a lock-free HMS to make use of thread-safe techniques and other optimizations to improve the performance of the HMS algorithm and reduce the latency of read-uncommitted state variable accesses. In our experiments, the proposed algorithm experiences an average 6.4x increase in performance up to 128 go-routines, and a maximum 11.1x increase.","[Painter, Zachary; Gayam, Pradeep Kumar; Cook, Victor; Dechev, Damian] Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA","State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida","Painter, Z (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.","zacharypainter@knights.ucf.edu; pradeep@knights.ucf.edu; victor.cook@knights.ucf.edu; dechev@cs.ucf.edu","","","National Science Foundation [CCF 1717515]; NSF [OAC 1740095]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was supported by the National Science Foundation under NSF CCF 1717515, and NSF OAC 1740095.","","13","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-6680-3","","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7IE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000848725400023","View Full Record in Web of Science"

As the industry has grown, there has also been an increase in scams looking to steal unsuspecting individuals' cryptocurrency. Many of the scams operate on visually similar but seemingly unconnected websites, advertised by malicious social media accounts, which either attempt an advance-fee scam or operate as phishing websites. This paper analyses public online and blockchain-based data to provide a deeper understanding of these cryptocurrency scams. The clustering technique DBSCAN is applied to the content of scam websites to discover a typology of advance-fee and phishing scams. It is found that the same entities are running multiple instances of similar scams, revealed by their online infrastructure and blockchain activity. The entities also manufacture public blockchain activity to create the appearance that their scams are genuine. Through source and destination of funds analysis, it is observed that victims usually send funds from fiat-accepting exchanges. The entities running these scams cash-out or launder their proceeds using a variety of avenues including exchanges, gambling sites, and mixers.","[Phillips, Ross; Wilder, Heidi] Elliptic, London, England","","Phillips, R (corresponding author), Elliptic, London, England.","r.phillips@elliptic.co; h.wilder@elliptic.co","","","","","","","28","5","5","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-6680-3","","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7IE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000848725400039","View Full Record in Web of Science"

As a consequence, they have attracted unprecedented attention on social media. Besides genuine discussions and legitimate investment initiatives, several deceptive activities have flourished. In this work, we chart the online cryptocurrency landscape across multiple platforms. To reach our goal, we collected a large dataset, composed of more than 50M messages published by almost 7M users on Twitter, Telegram and Discord, over three months. We performed bot detection on Twitter accounts sharing invite links to Telegram and Discord channels, and we discovered that more than 56% of them were bots or suspended accounts. Then, we applied topic modeling techniques to Telegram and Discord messages, unveiling two different deception schemes - pump-and-dump'' and Ponzi'' - and identifying the channels involved in these frauds. Whereas on Discord we found a negligible level of deception, on Telegram we retrieved 296 channels involved in pump-and-dump and 432 involved in Ponzi schemes, accounting for a striking 20% of the total. Moreover, we observed that 93% of the invite links shared by Twitter bots point to Telegram pump-and-dump channels, shedding light on a little-known social bot activity. Charting the landscape of online cryptocurrency manipulation can inform actionable policies to fight such abuse.","[Nizzoli, Leonardo; Tardelli, Serena; Cresci, Stefano; Tesconi, Maurizio] Natl Res Council IIT CNR, Inst Informat & Telemat, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Nizzoli, Leonardo; Tardelli, Serena; Avvenuti, Marco] Univ Pisa, Dept Informat Engn, I-56122 Pisa, Italy; [Ferrara, Emilio] Univ Southern Calif, Informat Sci Inst, Marina Del Rey, CA 90292 USA","Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Informatica e Telematica (IIT-CNR); Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT; University of Pisa; University of Southern California","Tardelli, S (corresponding author), Natl Res Council IIT CNR, Inst Informat & Telemat, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.;Tardelli, S (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Informat Engn, I-56122 Pisa, Italy.","serena.tardelli@iit.cnr.it","Cresci, Stefano/Q-4031-2018; Nizzoli, Leonardo/ABE-5096-2020; TESCONI, MAURIZIO/P-2441-2016; Ferrara, Emilio/F-6136-2012","Cresci, Stefano/0000-0003-0170-2445; Nizzoli, Leonardo/0000-0002-9168-8992; TESCONI, MAURIZIO/0000-0001-8228-7807; Ferrara, Emilio/0000-0002-1942-2831; Tardelli, Serena/0000-0002-7235-7055","Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) [FA9550-17-1-0327]; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [W911NF-17-C-0094, D16AP00115]","Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA))","This work was supported in part by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) under Award FA9550-17-1-0327, and in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Contract W911NF-17-C-0094 and Grant D16AP00115.","","63","15","16","5","5","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","113230","113245","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3003370","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3003370","","","16","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","MH0JD","","Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000546416100018","View Full Record in Web of Science"

These non-conjugacies necessitate the approximation of marginalization and expectation integrals, while the online inference constraint renders batch learning and Monte Carlo sampling unsuitable. Here we formulate the problem as a message passing task on a factor graph and propose an online variational message passing-based state and parameter tracking algorithm, which uses Gaussian quadrature to deal with non-conjugacies. We present improved message update rules for all non-conjugate couplings, thus allowing a plug-in inference method for alternative models with equivalent non-conjugate layer couplings.

A renowned Blockchain application is the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, that has not only been effectively solving the double-spending problem but also it can confirm the legitimacy of transactional records without relying on a centralized system to do so. Therefore, any application using Blockchain technology as the base architecture ensures that the contents of its data are tamper-proof. This paper uses the decentralized Blockchain technology approach to ensure that consumers do not fully rely on the merchants to determine if products are genuine. We describe a decentralized Blockchain system with products anti-counterfeiting, in that way manufacturers can use this system to provide genuine products without having to manage direct-operated stores, which can significantly reduce the cost of product quality assurance.","[Ma, Jinhua; Chen, Xin] Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Math & Informat, Fujian Prov Key Lab Network Secur & Cryptol, Fuzhou 350117, Peoples R China; [Lin, Shih-Ya; Sun, Hung-Min] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; [Chen, Yeh-Cheng] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Comp Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Wang, Huaxiong] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Phys & Math Sci, Div Math Sci, Singapore 639798, Singapore","Fujian Normal University; National Tsing Hua University; University of California System; University of California Davis; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University","Chen, X (corresponding author), Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Math & Informat, Fujian Prov Key Lab Network Secur & Cryptol, Fuzhou 350117, Peoples R China.;Sun, HM (corresponding author), Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.","xinchen9503@outlook.com; hmsun@cs.nthu.edu.tw","","Wang, Huaxiong/0000-0002-7669-8922","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61872089, 61902070, 61972094]; Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China [MOST 106-2221-E-007-026-MY3, MOST 107-2221-E-007-015-MY3, MOST 108-2218E001-001]; National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its Strategic Capability Research Centres Funding Initiative; Singapore Ministry of Education [MOE2016-T2-2-014(S)]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its Strategic Capability Research Centres Funding Initiative(National Research Foundation, Singapore); Singapore Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","The work of Jinhua Ma and Xin Chen was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61872089, Grant 61902070, and Grant 61972094.

The data sample is from August 7, 2015, to February 15, 2020. We measure the return risks of the cryptocurrencies by using the CAViaR model, showing that they have similar risk tendencies, with volatility clusterings from the beginning of 2017 to the end of 2018. The net pairwise spillover index developed by Diebold and Yilmaz [1] is used as the measure of the risk connectedness among the cryptocurrencies. We find that the risk spillover directions are highly correlative with the market capitalizations of the cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies with small market capitalization transmit risks to those with large market capitalization. When there is a downward risk tendency, the risk spillover levels among the cryptocurrencies are stronger than when there is an upward risk tendency, while the spillover directions remain the same under both risk tendencies, except for the cryptocurrency Monero, the particularity of which may be due to the difference in its trading volume compared to the others. We use generalized forecast error variance decomposition for the spillover index and explore the risk connectedness across the cryptocurrencies at different timescales, namely, the short term (0-4 days), medium term (4-30 days) and long term (30-300 days). The risk spillovers can be neglected at the short-term frequency, which implies a delayed effect. The risk spillovers at medium-term frequency are mostly stronger than those at long-term frequency. The dynamic connectedness results show that the means of risk spillover at a long-term frequency are larger than those at medium-term frequency. An inverse result holds for the ranges of risk spillover. The fluctuations of risk spillover at long-term and medium-term frequencies admit the same comparison result with the means of risk spillover in these two frequencies. The findings in this paper provide some suggestions for regulators controlling market stability and cryptocurrency investors generating investment strategies.","[Li, Zhenghui; Huang, Zhehao] Guangzhou Univ, Guangzhou Int Inst Finance, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yan] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Stat, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Guangzhou University; Guangzhou University","Huang, ZH (corresponding author), Guangzhou Univ, Guangzhou Int Inst Finance, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.","zhehao.h@gzhu.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [11701115]; Guangdong Natural Science Foundation [2018A030313115]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 11701115) and Guangdong Natural Science Foundation (No. 2018A030313115).","","46","24","24","5","34","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","2296-424X","","","FRONT PHYS-LAUSANNE","Front.

However, only a few of existing tokens proved a significant success on the market. The reason for that is a missing unified understanding of parameters required for success and the lack of standardization in token economics in general. This paper derives a unified token economics taxonomy considering regulatory authorities, practitioners, and academics. The taxonomy encompasses five dimensions which are essential for classifying token economics. Finally, this work derives eight universal success parameters of a token model and in a broader sense of DLS.

However, it is becoming clear that the success of such virtual currencies on the payments market is limited at best. More and more, they are being used as a means of investment, with investors speculating on their often dramatic value fluctuations. Moreover, a new class of virtual currencies has emerged that serves primarily or even only as a means of investment. These virtual currencies, generally issued through what is called an Initial Coin Offering or as part of a decentralized autonomous entity, may have to be regarded from the perspective of securities laws, rather than from the perspective of payments laws. This paper analyses a few of those investment virtual currencies and assesses them from the perspective of the EU's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive.","[Vandezande, Niels] Timelex CVBA, Brussels, Belgium; [Vandezande, Niels] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr IT & IP Law, Leuven, Belgium","KU Leuven","Vandezande, N (corresponding author), Timelex CVBA, Brussels, Belgium.;Vandezande, N (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr IT & IP Law, Leuven, Belgium.","","","Vandezande, Niels/0000-0001-9025-4706","","","","","44","3","3","1","1","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1752-1440","1752-1459","","LAW FINANC MATER REV","Law Financ.

By its design, blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way, providing solutions for many complex tasks without third party involvement. To achieve that, they employ a set of Byzantine Fault-tolerant consensus algorithms that require the implemented logic to be deterministic The lacking source of randomness is a consequential limitation since many application domains, like games, lotteries, or random elections, require random sources. Given the Byzantine Fault-tolerance, generating random numbers should also be publicly-verifiable and tamper-resistant, but still hold the premises of being unpredictable. In this paper, we will provide an overview of the current research surrounding pseudo-random number generation on a decentralized network that satisfies those requirements.","[Simic, Srdan Daniel; Sajina, Robert; Tankovic, Nikola; Etinger, Darko] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Informat, Pula, Croatia","University of Juraj Dobrila Pula","Simic, SD (corresponding author), Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Informat, Pula, Croatia.","ssimic@unipu.hr; robert.sajina@unipu.hr; nikola.tankovic@unipu.hr; darko.etinger@unipu.hr","","Sajina, Robert/0000-0002-4287-5898","","","","","20","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-953-233-099-1","","","","2020","","","","","","","1668","1673","","","","","","6","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BT0NT","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000790326400300","View Full Record in Web of Science"

What may be called the lex cryptographia of blockchain has been designed based on a rational choice vision of human behavior. Blockchain adopts a framing derived from neoclassical economics, and instantiates it in a new machinery that implements rational choice paradigms using blockchain in a semi-automatic way, across all spheres of life, and without regard to borders. Accordingly, a global law and cryptoeconomics movement is now emerging owing to the spread of blockchain. This Article suggests that such a rational choice paradigm is an insufficient foundation for the future development of blockchain. It seeks to develop a new understanding of blockchain and its regulation through code according to the emerging la and political economy framework. Blockchain is much more than a machine that enables the automation of transactions according to a rational choice framework. Blockchain should instead be understood as a technological infrastructure. Acknowledging the infrastructural dimension of blockchain technology may help identify a new role for the law in its interaction with blockchain, as well as for government in its interaction with the new technology. More precisely, identifying blockchain as an infrastructural commons helps us recognize that la and regulation should not be relegated to the role of merely facilitating the operation of the invisible hand of the market by and within blockchain, but should rather acquire more active roles, such as safeguarding access on non-discriminatory terms to users, on a model with net neutrality and other public utility safeguards. The Article closes by proposing a la and political economy frame work for blockchain that is based on principles of publicness, trust, and interoperability.","[Dimitropoulos, Georgios] Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ HBKU, Coll Law, Law, Education City, Ar Rayyan, Qatar; [Dimitropoulos, Georgios] UCL, Ctr Law Econ & Soc UCL CLES, London, England; [Dimitropoulos, Georgios] UCL, Ctr Blockchain Technol UCL CBT, London, England","Qatar Foundation (QF); Hamad Bin Khalifa University-Qatar; University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London","Dimitropoulos, G (corresponding author), Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ HBKU, Coll Law, Law, Education City, Ar Rayyan, Qatar.;Dimitropoulos, G (corresponding author), UCL, Ctr Law Econ & Soc UCL CLES, London, England.;Dimitropoulos, G (corresponding author), UCL, Ctr Blockchain Technol UCL CBT, London, England.","georgios.dimitropoulos@yale.edu","","","","","","","257","7","7","5","14","UNIV WASHINGTON SCHOOL OF LAW","SEATTLE","WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW 1100 NE CAMPUS PARKWAY 410 CONDON HALL, SEATTLE, WA 98105 USA","0043-0617","","","WASH LAW REV","Wash.

Until now, blockchain technology has been intensively developed in financial fields such as Bitcoin. As the blockchain technology develops, the application fields of blockchain are expected to further expand. We proposed a technology analysis method for sustainability of blockchain technology. We analyzed the patent documents related to blockchain for sustainable technology analysis. To carry out the technology analysis, we preprocessed the patent documents and built a structure data, document-term matrix. In general, most elements of this matrix are zeros, so it is very skewed. Due to the skewness, technology analysis by traditional methods of statistics has analytical difficulty. To overcome this problem, we proposed a technology analysis method based on generalized additive modeling. To show how our proposed method can be applied to practical fields, we collected and analyzed the patent documents of blockchain technology.","[Park, Sangsung; Jun, Sunghae] Cheongju Univ, Dept Big Data & Stat, Chungbuk 28503, South Korea","Cheongju University","Jun, S (corresponding author), Cheongju Univ, Dept Big Data & Stat, Chungbuk 28503, South Korea.","hanyul@cju.ac.kr; shjun@cju.ac.kr","","Jun, Sunghae/0000-0003-1961-0055","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2020R1I1A3A04037885]","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2020R1I1A3A04037885).","","42","0","0","4","16","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2071-1050","","SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL","Sustainability","DEC","2020","12","24","","","","","","","10501","10.3390/su122410501","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su122410501","","","15","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","PL6DA","","gold, Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000603208900001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This paper aims to contribute to existing studies on pricing by studying the relationship between price changes in relation to changes in nominal value of the cryptocurrency. To this, the authors qualitatively study product descriptions and images to expand the knowledge on price formation. Design/methodology/approach The authors analysed 15 samples based on visual and textual scrapes from two major drug markets - for Dream Market between January 2014 and July 2015 and for Tochka between January 2015 and July 2015. This longitudinal study relates changes in process to variations in the Bitcoin exchange rate and selling strategies. The analysis of the marketing of drugs online also addressed the development of the vendor profile and product offers. Findings Product prices change in relation to variations in the Bitcoin exchange rate. This points to the application of mechanisms for automatic price adaptations on the market level. Real prices of the drug offers constantly increase. The authors assert that there is a bidirectional relationship. Vendors structure price and discounts to encourage feedback. And feedback in combination with signals of commitment and authenticity inform pricing. Product descriptions are an important feature in the successful marketization of goods, whereas product images are predominantly used as an aspect of recognisability and feature of the vendor's identity. Research limitations/implications Findings suggest that there is great potential for further qualitative research into the relationship between the online and offline identity of drug vendors, as well as price setting when entering the market and subsequent changes for offered products. Practical implications Findings also suggest that further investigation into the constitution and management of vendor's identity on the cryptomarkets would allow a better understanding of vendors and their interactions on cryptomarkets. Social implications A better understanding of drug trading on cryptomarkets helps to more effectively address potentials for harm in the online drug trade. Also targetting crime would benefit from a better understanding of vendor idenities and pricing. Originality/value The findings represent a valuable contribution to existing knowledge on drug trading on cryptomarkets, particularly in view of pricing and vending strategies.","[Zaunseder, Andreas] Univ Aberdeen, Ctr Citizenship Civil Soc & Rule Law, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Bancroft, Angus] Univ Edinburgh, Dept Sociol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","University of Aberdeen; University of Edinburgh","Zaunseder, A (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Ctr Citizenship Civil Soc & Rule Law, Aberdeen, Scotland.","r02az16@abdn.ac.uk; angus.bancroft@ed.ac.uk","","","","","","","35","0","0","1","5","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1745-9265","2042-8359","","DRUGS ALCOHOL TODAY","Drugs Alcohol Today","MAY 19","2021","21","2","","","SI","","135","145","","10.1108/DAT-12-2019-0054","http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/DAT-12-2019-0054","","JUL 2020","11","Substance Abuse","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Substance Abuse","SF2OM","","Green Accepted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000553672400001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Since markets seldom stabilize, our model mimics the real market behavior. We introduce three models. All of them are modifications of the original J.-M. Lasry and P. L. Lions evolution model. In the first modified model, a random term is added to mimic the randomness of trading in the real market. This reflects markets with low volatility, where it might be difficulty to buy or sell goods at specific price. In the second model, we use cumulative density function instead of density function. We give numerical simulations on these two models in order to have a general picture on the solution. In the third model, we add a term associated with the parameter R to destabilize the original Larsy-Lions model and study oscillations and wave solutions depending on different values of R. We also study existence and uniqueness of the solution.

At the same time, most African economies continue to be at the tail end of global financial innovations adoption. Given lagging consumer adoption of cryptocurrency in South Africa, the purpose of this paper is to apply the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to predict behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency. Design/methodology/approach A survey instrument based on the TPB was used to collect quantitative data for predicting adoption from adult distance students at the Mancosa, Cape Town campus. For data analysis, the two-step structural equation modelling approach was used. Findings The findings indicate that attitude and perceived behavioural control positively impact the intention to adopt cryptocurrency. Subjective norm showed a negative non-significant influence. Overall, the results of the study show that the model has a good model fit and can be used to explain the theory. Originality/value The contribution of this paper is threefold: it is one of a few studies on the behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency in South Africa using the TPB model, it contributes towards the use of predictive behavioural economics models in understanding consumer behaviour critical to accelerating the adoption of financial innovations, and the results of the study also inform behaviour change strategies that can be applied by practitioners or policymakers to improve adoption.

While confidential transactions can hide transaction amounts, its storage overhead is extremely high (e.g., 10 similar to 20X). This substantial overhead significantly raises users' overheads in bootstrapping and impedes new nodes, especially for resource-limited devices. We devise a new method, referred to as EcoBoost, to advance the efficiency of bootstrapping for blockchains supporting confidential transactions. Specifically, we harness random sampling to verify the correctness of confidential transactions with high probability. As a result, the verification overhead is sublinear with regard to the number of transactions (compared to linear in current solutions). Our experiment results show that, if Bitcoin implements confidential transactions, EcoBoost can save over 86% storage and verification time in bootstrapping but still detect bogus transactions with a probability of 99%.","[Wang, Chenggang; Wang, Boyang] Univ Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; [Fan, Xinxin] Hyperconnect Lab Inc, Menlo Pk, CA USA","University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati","Wang, CG (corresponding author), Univ Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.","wang2c9@mail.uc.edu; boyang.wang@uc.edu; xinxin@iotex.io","","","Ohio Cyber Range, UC Office of Research","Ohio Cyber Range, UC Office of Research","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for the helpful comments.

While much of this attention has revolved around cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, many see the true promise of blockchain technology in its potential use for transactions in traditional assets, as well as for facilitating self-executing `smart contracts', which replace vague and imprecise natural language with unambiguous computer code. This article presents a simple legal argument against the feasibility of a meaningful blockchain-based economic system. Blockchain-based systems are shown to be unsuitable for transactions in traditional assets, unless design choices are made which render the use of the technology pointless. The same argument is shown to apply to smart contracts. Legal and practical obstacles therefore mean that, outside its original realm of cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology is highly unlikely to transform economic interactions in the real world.","[Schuster, Edmund] London Sch Econ, Law, London, England; [Schuster, Edmund] UCL Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England","University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; University College London","Schuster, E (corresponding author), London Sch Econ, Law, London, England.;Schuster, E (corresponding author), UCL Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England.","","Schuster, Edmund-Philipp/J-2578-2014","Schuster, Edmund-Philipp/0000-0002-9355-535X","","","","","98","5","5","1","5","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0026-7961","1468-2230","","MOD LAW REV","Mod.

Despite the great evolution of the time series theory, forecasters are still in the hunt for better models to make more accurate decisions. The huge advances in neural networks over the last years has led to the emergence of a new generation of effective models replacing classic econometric models. It is in this direction that we propose, in this paper, a new multiscaled Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), with the aim of forecasting multivariate time series. This new model, called Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)-based Neural ARDL, is inspired from the well-known Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model being our proposal founded upon the concepts of nonlinearity, EMD-multiresolution and neural networks. These features give the model the ability to effectively capture many nonlinear patterns like the ones often present in econophysical time series, such as nonlinear trends, seasonal effects, long-range dependency, etc. The proposed algorithm can be summarized into the following four basic tasks: (i) EMD breaking-down multivariate time series into different resolution levels, (ii) feeding EMD components from the same levels into a number of feedforward neural ARDL models, (iii) from one level to the next, extrapolating the component corresponding to the response variable (scalar output) a number of steps ahead, and finally, (iv) recombining level-by-level forecasts into a single output. An optimal learning scheme is rigorously designed for efficiently training the new proposed architecture. The approach is finally tested and compared to a number of powerful benchmark models, where experiments are conducted on real-world data.","[Saadaoui, Foued] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Stat, POB 80203, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Ben Messaoud, Othman] Univ Sfax, Fac Econ & Management FSEGS, Route Aeroport Km 4, Sfax 3018, Tunisia","King Abdulaziz University; Universite de Sfax","Saadaoui, F (corresponding author), King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Stat, POB 80203, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.","fsadawi@kau.edu.sa","Saâdaoui, Foued/J-9710-2019","Saâdaoui, Foued/0000-0002-0574-2922","Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah [DF-302-125-1441]; DSR","Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah; DSR","This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Under Grant No. (DF-302-125-1441).

However, the lack of miners makes the network vulnerable to denial of service attacks. We propose an anti spam mechanism based on the solution of a cryptographic puzzle: When a node wants to generate a new transaction, it dynamically adapts the difficulty of the puzzle depending on its target throughput and on its reputation score. Specifically, the adaptive difficulty property guarantees that any node, even with low hashing power, can achieve similar throughput for a given reputation. In the paper, we prove this claim both analytically and through simulations, and we show that fairness between low- and high-power nodes is indeed reached.","[Vigneri, Luigi; Welz, Wolfgang] IOTA Fdn, D-10405 Berlin, Germany","","Vigneri, L (corresponding author), IOTA Fdn, D-10405 Berlin, Germany.","luigi.vigneri@iota.org; wolfgang.welz@iota.org","","","","","","","7","2","2","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-6680-3","","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7IE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000848725400065","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, technology is evolving faster than standardization frameworks. This left the industry in the position of having to use this emerging technology, without being backed by any international standards organization regarding for neither the technology itself, nor for a blockchain specific information security framework. In times of the General Data Protection Regulation and growing international trade conflicts, protecting information is more relevant than ever. Standardization of blockchains is an appeal to raise the development of information technologies to the next level. Therefore, this paper shall provide an overview of standardization organization's publications about blockchains/distributed ledger technologies, a set of comparison criteria for future work and a comparison of the existing standards work itself. With that information, aligning to existing standardization efforts becomes easier, and might even present the possibility to create frameworks where there are none at the moment.","[Konig, Lukas; Korobeinikova, Yuliia; Tjoa, Simon; Kieseberg, Peter] St Polten Univ Appl Sci, Josef Ressel Ctr Blockchains & Secur Management, A-3100 St Polten, Austria","","Konig, L (corresponding author), St Polten Univ Appl Sci, Josef Ressel Ctr Blockchains & Secur Management, A-3100 St Polten, Austria.","is191836@fhstp.ac.at; yuliia.korobeinikova@fhstp.ac.at; simon.tjoa@fhstp.ac.at; peter.kieseberg@fhstp.ac.at","Tjoa, Simon/H-8507-2012; Kieseberg, Peter/D-8137-2015","Tjoa, Simon/0000-0003-2280-9604; Konig, Lukas/0000-0002-7328-5428; Kieseberg, Peter/0000-0002-2847-2152; Korobeinikova, Yuliia/0000-0001-9247-1448","Josef Ressel Center for Blockchain Technologies & Security Management (BLOCKCHAINS); Austrian Research Promotion Agency; Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; Christian Doppler Research Association","Josef Ressel Center for Blockchain Technologies & Security Management (BLOCKCHAINS); Austrian Research Promotion Agency; Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; Christian Doppler Research Association","This research was funded by the Josef Ressel Center for Blockchain Technologies & Security Management (BLOCKCHAINS).

In this paper, we investigate a subtle issue when forgetting password: The account owner uses guessed passwords during the authentication with a service provider. This is different from password guessing by cyber attackers, because passwords guessed by the account owner are (most likely) his/her passwords (or their minor variations) registered with other service providers. Thus, the confidentiality of incorrect passwords in unsuccessful authentication needs protection. To capture this security requirement, we define two security goals: Indistinguishability of Incorrect Passwords (INDPW) and Unextractablility of Incorrect Passwords (UNE-PW). Our analysis shows that: (1) IND-PW is NOT achievable if password is the only authentication credential of the client, and (2) Two common authentication methods in online services, Basic and Digest Access Authentication (in conjunction with SSL), CANNOT provide UNE-PW.

Blockchain-enabled Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have emerged as a new form of collective governance, in which communities may organize themselves relying on decentralized infrastructure. In this article, we introduce the concept of DAO and review the main software platforms that offer DAO creation as a service, which simplifies the use of DAOs to non-blockchain experts; namely: Aragon, DAOstack, DAOhaus and Colony. These platforms will be compared by showing their key features. Finally, we will review the available visualisation tools for DAOs, and we will introduce our open-source tool to plot DAOs activity, DAO-Analyzer.

On the other hand, cameras are classified in terms of both reliability and security in my method for making trust chains of cameras against fabrication. In this paper, I also explain the condition for making the trust chains. A owner of a camera which shot violation of a regulation or an illegal action is rewarded with a fine for the violation or the penalty instead of bitcoin, and a signer of a chain is also rewarded.

We then take these design requirements for auditors and, using design science research (DSR), we consider the transaction processing and contracting contexts that match those requirements in permissioned blockchains. The blockchains discussed in this paper would typically be business-to-business or business-to-consumer, private or semi-private, and residing in either a private, semi-private, or public cloud.

The present paper(1) fills this research gap by identifying 14 attributes, each of which is assigned different characteristics, that can be used to classify all types of assets in a structured manner. Our proposed taxonomy, which is an extension of existing classification frameworks, summarises these findings in a morphological box and is tested for practicability by classifying exemplary assets like cash and bitcoin. The final classification framework can help to ensure that the various stakeholders, such as investors or supervisors, have a consistent view of the different types of assets, and in particular of their characteristics, and also helps to establish standardised terminology.","[Ankenbrand, Thomas; Bieri, Denis] Lucerne Univ Appl Sci & Arts, Luzern, Switzerland; [Cortivo, Roland; Hoehener, Johannes] Swisscom AG, Bern, Switzerland; [Hardjono, Thomas] MIT Connect Sci, Cambridge, MA USA","","Ankenbrand, T (corresponding author), Lucerne Univ Appl Sci & Arts, Luzern, Switzerland.","","","","Finnova; Inventx; Swiss Bankers Prepaid Services; Swisscom","Finnova; Inventx; Swiss Bankers Prepaid Services; Swisscom","Our research is part of the FinTech programme supported by Finnova, Inventx, Swiss Bankers Prepaid Services, and Swisscom.","","14","4","4","2","6","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-9390-8","","","","2020","","","","","","","16","26","","10.1109/CVCBT50464.2020.00006","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CVCBT50464.2020.00006","","","11","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BQ7OL","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000618062100002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Based on the inherent properties of UTXO set, we propose two loss-less compression techniques to reduce the memory space occupied by UTXO set. Besides, the database related operations are adapted to make the proposed mechanism easily applied in current blockchain system. Taking Bitcoin as the object of study, our mechanism can deliver 2.9-4.5x memory reduction and orders of magnitude validation speed improvement in resource-constrained situations.

Therefore, this research aimed to study whether the hedge effectiveness of cryptocurrencies still exists. This research used five cryptocurrencies (bitcoin, ethereum, monero, ripple, and litecoin), equity indices (Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines), and iShares ETF MSCI World (developed world). Commodities-based hedging using iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust was also analyzed as a comparison. The asymmetric generalized dynamic conditional correlation (AG-DCC) GARCH showed that one cryptocurrency could not significantly and consistently hedge equities while five equally weighted cryptocurrencies could marginally hedge equities. Meanwhile, the classical minimum variance model also showed that the hedge effectiveness of cryptocurrencies was insignificantly positive. Equity traders could add cryptocurrencies into portfolios when the purpose was to maximize the Sharpe ratio instead of hedging. Overall, commodities were the better hedge for Southeast Asia emerging markets.","[Susilo, Didik; Wahyudi, Sugeng; Pangestuti, Irene Rini Demi] Univ Diponegoro, Semarang, Indonesia; [Nugroho, Bayu Adi] Perbanas Inst, South Jakarta, Indonesia; [Robiyanto, Robiyanto] Satya Wacana Christian Univ, Salatiga, Indonesia","Diponegoro University; Universitas Kristen Satya Wacana","Robiyanto, R (corresponding author), Satya Wacana Christian Univ, Dept Management, Fac Econ & Business, Jl Diponegoro 52-60, Salatiga 50711, Indonesia.","robiyanto@staff.uksw.edu","Wahyudi, Sugeng/GQY-6164-2022; Pangestuti, Irene Rini Demi/GQR-2609-2022; Nugroho, Bayu Adi/AAA-4933-2021; Robiyanto, Robiyanto/X-5334-2019","Nugroho, Bayu Adi/0000-0001-6113-9362; Robiyanto, Robiyanto/0000-0003-3565-1594; Susilo, Didik/0000-0003-1522-2389","","","","","28","4","4","3","7","SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","THOUSAND OAKS","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","2158-2440","","","SAGE OPEN","SAGE Open","OCT","2020","10","4","","","","","","","2.1582440209716E+15","10.1177/2158244020971609","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2158244020971609","","","14","Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Social Sciences - Other Topics","PA7DT","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000595792100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Thus, consensus algorithms have been developed in order to increase the security and especially the integrity of the crypto currencies. These consensus algorithms indirectly influence the market value of crypto currencies. In this study, consensus algorithms of some crypto currencies have been investigated. In addition to the SHA256 algorithm, the advantages and disadvantages of using Shake and Keccak algorithms as a part of the consensus algorithms, have been analyzed. SHA256, Keccak and Shake algorithms are compared regarding to their performance. As a result, we recommend that the cryptographic hash function can be replaced with the Shake algorithm can be an extendable output function for new crypto currencies.","[Emec, Murat; Dalkilic, Gokhan] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Izmir, Turkey; [Karatay, Melike] Ege Univ, Izmir, Turkey; [Alkim, Erdem] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Samsun, Turkey","Dokuz Eylul University; Ege University; Ondokuz Mayis University","Karatay, M (corresponding author), Ege Univ, Izmir, Turkey.","murat.emec@ceng.deu.edu.tr; melike.karatay@ceng.deu.edu.tr; dalkilic@cs.deu.edu.tr; erdem.alkim@omu.edu.tr","EMEÇ, Murat/ACF-6411-2022; Dalkılıç, Gökhan/B-8292-2014; EMEÇ, Murat/AFT-0930-2022; Alkim, Erdem/X-9220-2019","EMEÇ, Murat/0000-0002-9407-1728; Dalkılıç, Gökhan/0000-0002-0130-1716; EMEÇ, Murat/0000-0002-9407-1728; Alkim, Erdem/0000-0003-4638-2422; Karatay, Melike/0000-0001-6941-4752","","","","","14","0","0","0","2","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","2367-4512","","978-3-030-36178-5; 978-3-030-36177-8","LECT NOTE DATA ENG","","","2020","43","","","","","","572","583","","10.1007/978-3-030-36178-5_46","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-36178-5_46","","","12","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Mathematics; Telecommunications","BR9NE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000678771000046","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The potential applications of blockchain beyond finance and banking encouraged many organizations to integrate and adopt blockchain into existing or new software systems. Integrating and using any new computing paradigm is expected to affect the best practice and design principles of building software systems. This paper summarizes our ongoing research on collecting, categorizing and understanding, existing software design patterns when building blockchain-based software systems.

Our starting assumption is that there exist cross-country indicators that are related to Darknet market activity. We identify relevant indicators, and discuss their relationship to cybercrime from a theoretical perspective. We apply regression modelling and conduct a qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to study the impact of the identified indicators on the number of items offered on the Darknet.

However, blockchain scalability is emerging as a challenging issue. This paper outlines the existing solutions to blockchain scalability, which can be classified into two categories: first layer and second layer solutions. First layer solutions propose modifications to the blockchain (i.e., changing the blockchain structure, such as block size) while second layer solutions propose mechanisms that are implemented outside of the blockchain. In particular, we focus on sharding as a promising first layer solution to the scalability issue; the basic idea behind sharding is to divide the blockchain network into multiple committees, each processing a separate set of transactions. More specifically, (a) we propose a taxonomy based on committee formation and intra-committee consensus; and (b) we compare the main existing sharding-based blockchain protocols. We also present a performance-based comparative analysis (i.e., throughput and latency), of the advantages, and disadvantages in existing scalability solutions.","[Hafid, Abdelatif; Samih, Mustapha] Univ Moulay Ismail, Fac Sci, Dept Math, Team EDA,Math Lab & Their Applicat, Meknes 50050, Morocco; [Hafid, Abdelatif; Hafid, Abdelhakim Senhaji] Univ Montreal, Dept Comp Sci & Operat Res, Montreal Blockchain Lab, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada","Moulay Ismail University of Meknes; Universite de Montreal","Hafid, A (corresponding author), Univ Moulay Ismail, Fac Sci, Dept Math, Team EDA,Math Lab & Their Applicat, Meknes 50050, Morocco.;Hafid, A (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept Comp Sci & Operat Res, Montreal Blockchain Lab, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada.","a.hafid@edu.umi.ac.ma","","Hafid, Abdelatif/0000-0002-1377-1387","Mohammed VI Polytechnic University - UM6P","Mohammed VI Polytechnic University - UM6P","This work was supported in part by Mohammed VI Polytechnic University - UM6P.","","90","34","34","10","30","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","125244","125262","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3007251","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3007251","","","19","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","MS9CX","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000554571000001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The difference of high and low price gives the price range, and the range-based estimator of volatility is more efficient than the return-based estimator of realized volatility. A more general fractional cointegration technique applied is the Fractional Cointegrating Vector Autoregressive framework. The results show that high and low cryptocurrency prices are actually cointegrated in both stationary and non-stationary levels; that is, the range of high-low price. It is therefore quite interesting to note that the fractional cointegration approach presents a lower measure of the persistence for the range compared to the fractional integration approach, and the results are insensitive to different time frequencies. The main finding in this work serves as an alternative volatility estimation method in cryptocurrency and other assets' price modelling and forecasting.","[Yaya, OlaOluwa S.; Ogbonna, Ahamuefula E.] Univ Ibadan, Dept Stat, Econ & Financial Stat Unit, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Yaya, OlaOluwa S.; Vo, Xuan Vinh] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Inst Business Res, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Vo, Xuan Vinh] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, CFVG, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Ogbonna, Ahamuefula E.] Univ Ibadan, Ctr Econometr & Allied Res, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Adewuyi, Adeolu O.] Univ Ibadan, Fac Econ, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Adewuyi, Adeolu O.] Univ Ibadan, Sch Business, Ibadan, Nigeria","University of Ibadan; Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; University of Ibadan; University of Ibadan; University of Ibadan","Yaya, OS (corresponding author), Univ Ibadan, Dept Stat, Econ & Financial Stat Unit, Ibadan, Nigeria.","os.yaya@ui.edu.ng","Ogbonna, Ahamuefula/AAH-8086-2020; YAYA, OLAOLUWA S./N-1615-2019","Ogbonna, Ahamuefula/0000-0002-9127-5231; YAYA, OLAOLUWA S./0000-0002-7554-3507","","","","","39","3","3","0","3","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1076-9307","1099-1158","","INT J FINANC ECON","Int.

Thousands of new cryptocurrencies have emerged, proposing new and novel techniques that improve on Bitcoin's core innovation of the blockchain data structure and consensus mechanism. However, cryptocurrencies are a major target for cyber-attacks, as they can be sold on exchanges anonymously and most cryptocurrencies have their codebases publicly available. One particular issue is the prevalence of code clones in crypto-currencies, which may amplify security threats. If a vulnerability is found in one cryptocurrency, it might be propagated into other cloned cryptocurrencies. In this work, we propose a systematic remedy to this problem, called COINWATCH (CW). Given a reported vulnerability at the input, CW uses the code evolution analysis and a clone detection technique for the indication of cryptocurrencies that might be vulnerable. We applied CW on 1094 cryptocurrencies using 4 CVEs and obtained 786 true vulnerabilities present in 384 projects, which were confirmed with developers and successfully reported as CVE extensions.","[Hum, Qingze; Tan, Wei Jin; Tey, Shi Ying; Lenus, Latasha] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Singapore, Singapore; [Homoliak, Ivan] Brno Univ Technol, FIT, Brno, Czech Republic; [Lin, Yun] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Sun, Jun] Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore","Singapore University of Technology & Design; Brno University of Technology; National University of Singapore; Singapore Management University","Hum, QZ (corresponding author), Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Singapore, Singapore.","qzhum1996@gmail.com; ihomoliak@fit.vutbr.cz; dcsliny@nus.edu.sg; sunjunhqq@gmail.com","Homoliak, Ivan/V-7525-2019","Homoliak, Ivan/0000-0002-0790-0875","NRF, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, under its National Cybersecurity RD Programme [NRF-2016NCRNCR002-028]; Czech Science Foundation [20-07487S]; internal project of BUT IGA [FIT-S-20-6427]","NRF, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, under its National Cybersecurity RD Programme; Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); internal project of BUT IGA","This work was supported by the NRF, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, under its National Cybersecurity R&D Programme (Award No. NRF2016NCRNCR002-028) and administered by the National Cybersecurity R&D Directorate.

The centralized operation model of CAs has already caused several targeted attacks due to the distribution of rogue certificates. Users remain vulnerable since it is too challenging to detect and revoke such certificates, but also to speed up the user update process when a certificate is revoked. To address such issues, a decentralized PKI alternative approach, targeting Domain Validated certificates, is proposed. In the proposed approach, which is based on blockchain technologies (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum), the transparency, immutability and decentralization aspects of these technologies have been leveraged.

Zcash is an altcoin of Bitcoin aiming to protect blockchain anonymity. Its anonymity is highly guaranteed by zero-knowledge proofs. However, it is still practicable to decrease Zcash & x2019;s anonymity. In this paper, we provide a refined empirical analysis of Zcash anonymity. We improve current address clustering methods and increase the clustering rate by 9 & x0025;. We also analyze the whole process of distributing mining reward and identify 87.5 & x0025; addresses and 25.7 & x0025; transactions. Besides, we simplify Zcash transaction network and then pick out nodes (edges) which play important roles in network connectivity. We show that these nodes are mostly mining pools. In particular, users participating in shieldedpool are mostly founders, miners and mining pools, although shieldedpool itself is designed for protecting anonymity of users with high privacy requirements. Our results, to an extent, are opposite to the original intention of Zcash.","[Zhang, Zongyang; Li, Weihan; Liu, Jianwei] Beihang Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Liu, Haitao] Chinese Flight Test Estab, Xian 710089, Peoples R China","Beihang University","Zhang, ZY (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.","zongyangzhang@buaa.edu.cn","","Weihan, Li/0000-0002-2846-593X","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB1400702]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61972017, 61972018, 61932014, 61972310]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [4182033]; National Cryptography Development Fund [MMJJ20180215]; Beihang University Innovation & Practice Fund for Graduate [YCSJ-02-2019-011]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); National Cryptography Development Fund; Beihang University Innovation & Practice Fund for Graduate","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFB1400702, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61972017, Grant 61972018, Grant 61932014, and Grant 61972310, in part by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation under Grant 4182033, in part by the National Cryptography Development Fund under Grant MMJJ20180215, and in part by the Beihang University Innovation & Practice Fund for Graduate under Grant YCSJ-02-2019-011.","","23","8","8","1","5","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","31845","31853","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973291","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973291","","","9","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","LC6CT","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000525419100005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, the hype generated by the technology and its potential implications for real-world applications is flawed by many misconceptions about how it works and how it is implemented, creating faulty thinking or overly optimistic expectations. Too often, characteristics such as immutability, transparency, and censorship resistance, which mainly belong to the bitcoin blockchain, are sought in regular blockchains, whose potential is barely comparable. Furthermore, critical aspects such as oracles and their role in smart contracts receive few literature contributions, leaving results and theoretical implications highly questionable. This literature review of the latest papers in the field aims to give clarity to the blockchain oracle problem by discussing its effects in some of the most promising real-world applications. The analysis supports the view that the more trusted a system is, the less the oracle problem impacts.","[Caldarelli, Giulio] Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, I-37129 Verona, Italy","University of Verona","Caldarelli, G (corresponding author), Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, I-37129 Verona, Italy.","giulio.caldarelli@univr.it","Caldarelli, Giulio/ABC-5351-2020","Caldarelli, Giulio/0000-0002-8922-7871","","","","","98","33","33","3","13","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2078-2489","","INFORMATION","Information","NOV","2020","11","11","","","","","","","509","10.3390/info11110509","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info11110509","","","19","Computer Science, Information Systems","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Computer Science","OX1TL","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000593355900001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It has been used in many applications of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, since IoT applications often introduce a massive number of devices into blockchain systems, the efficiency of the blockchain becomes a serious problem. In this article, we analyze the key factors affecting the efficiency of blockchain. Unlike most existing solutions that handle this from the computing perspective, we consider the problem from the communication perspective. In particular, we propose a coordinated satellite-terrestrial network to create efficient blockchains. We also derive a network scheduling strategy for the proposed architecture. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system can support blockchains for higher efficiency. Moreover, several open research issues and design challenges will be discussed.","[Wei, Hongxin; Feng, Wei; Ge, Ning] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chi] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yunfei] Univ Warwick, Sch Engn, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Fang, Yuguang] Univ Florida, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Tsinghua University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; University of Warwick; State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Feng, W (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.","","zhang, chi/GRX-3610-2022; Fang, Yuguang/A-7484-2009","Fang, Yuguang/0000-0002-1079-3871; , Yunfei/0000-0001-8083-1805","National Key RAMP;D Program of China [2018YFA0701601]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61922049, 61941104, 61771286, 61701457, 91638205]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [L172041]; Beijing Innovation Center for Future Chip; Peng Cheng Laboratory; Natural Science Foundation of China [61672106, 61702474]; U.S. National Science Foundation [IIS-1722791]","National Key RAMP;D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); Beijing Innovation Center for Future Chip; Peng Cheng Laboratory; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","The work of W.

Its decentralized feature has a broad application prospect, but still faces scalability problem. Currently, blockchain scalability bottleneck is mainly in three aspects: performance inefficiency, high confirmation delay, and function extension. For example, Bitcoin can only deal with 7 transactions per second averagely. Obviously, it cannot meet the requirement of current digital payment scenarios, nor can it be carried in other applications such as distributed storage and credit service. What's more, different blockchain systems carry different business and requirements, so scalability is the core issue of the current development of blockchain. This paper introduces the blockchain scalability related technologies from the aspects of improving efficiency and extending functionality of blockchain system, respectively. We summarize four mainstream solutions to improve the performance of blockchain system, including Sharding mechanism, directed acyclic graph based (DAG-based), off-chain payment network and cross-chain technology. In the end, we give some suggestions for further research in blockchain scalability.","[Yang, Di; Xu, Han] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Comp, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Long, Chengnian] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Peng, Shaoliang] Hunan Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Changsha, Peoples R China","National University of Defense Technology - China; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Hunan University","Peng, SL (corresponding author), Hunan Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Changsha, Peoples R China.","469481032@qq.com; longcn@sjtu.edu.cn; xuhan_email@aliyun.com; pengshaoliang@nudt.edu.cn","","","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0202602, 2018YFC0910405, 2017YFC1311003, 2016YFC1302500, 2016YFB0200400, 2017YFB0202104]; NSFC [61772543, U1435222, 61625202, 61272056]; Funds of Peng Cheng Lab, State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Guangdong Provincial Department of Science and Technology [2016B090918122]","National Key R&D Program of China; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Funds of Peng Cheng Lab, State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Guangdong Provincial Department of Science and Technology","This work was supported by National Key R&D Program of China 2017YFB0202602, 2018YFC0910405, 2017YFC1311003, 2016YFC1302500, 2016YFB0200400, 2017YFB0202104; NSFC Grants 61772543, U1435222, 61625202, 61272056; The Funds of Peng Cheng Lab, State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and Guangdong Provincial Department of Science and Technology under grant No. 2016B090918122.","","16","15","15","10","55","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","","978-1-4503-7767-6","","","","2020","","","","","","","1","6","","10.1145/3390566.3391665","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3390566.3391665","","","6","Business, Finance; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Information Science & Library Science; Management","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics; Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science","BR1KL","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000632684300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Undisclosed channel balances and mismatched transaction fees cause delays and failures on some payment paths. For atomic transfer schemes, these straggling paths stall the whole transfer. We show that the latency of transfers reduces when redundant payment paths are added. This frees up liquidity in payment channels and hence increases the throughput of the network. We devise Boomerang, a generic technique to be used on top of multi-path routing schemes to construct redundant payment paths free of counterparty risk. In our experiments, applying Boomerang to a baseline routing scheme leads to 40% latency reduction and 2x throughput increase. We build on ideas from publicly verifiable secret sharing, such that Alice learns a secret of Bob iff Bob overdraws funds from the redundant paths. Funds are forwarded using Boomerang contracts, which allow Alice to revert the transfer iff she has learned Bob's secret. We implement the Boomerang contract in Bitcoin Script.","[Bagaria, Vivek; Neu, Joachim; Tse, David] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Stanford University","Neu, J (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.","vbagaria@stanford.edu; jneu@stanford.edu; dntse@stanford.edu","","","Center for Science of Information, an NSF Science and Technology Center [CCF-0939370]; Reed-Hodgson Stanford Graduate Fellowship","Center for Science of Information, an NSF Science and Technology Center(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Reed-Hodgson Stanford Graduate Fellowship","We thank Giulia Fanti and Lei Yang for fruitful discussions.

Traditional IoT data exchange services rely on a centralized third-party to negotiate the settlement of trades between data consumers and providers. Such settlement model suffers from issues including single point of failure, extra settlement fee, un-transparency of settlement details, to name a few. New settlement model is imperative to overcome such limitations. Blockchain is an innovative technology that is competent in governing the decentralized network, which poses great opportunity to implement fair settlement in decentralized manner. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-enabled settlement model for decentralized IoT data exchange services. Firstly, Bitcoin-based time commitment scheme is adopted to build fair and autonomous settlement model. Furthermore, to enhance the accountability of all transactions, an optimized practical Byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol named ReBFT, is proposed to enable all members involved in the IoT data exchange application achieve identical shared ledger recording all transactions. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility of our proposal.","[Lin, Wenmin] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Inst VR & Intelligent Syst, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Yin, Xiaochun] Weifang Univ Sci & Technol, Facil Hort Lab Univ Shangdong, Weifang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shoujin] Macquarie Univ, Dept Comp, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Khosravi, Mohammad R.] Persian Gulf Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Bushehr, Iran; [Khosravi, Mohammad R.] Shiraz Univ Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Shiraz, Iran","Hangzhou Normal University; Macquarie University; Persian Gulf University; Shiraz University of Technology","Khosravi, MR (corresponding author), Persian Gulf Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Bushehr, Iran.;Khosravi, MR (corresponding author), Shiraz Univ Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Shiraz, Iran.","linwenmin_cn@126.com; xiaochunyin@wfust.edu.cn; shoujin.wang@mq.edu.au; m.khosravi@sutech.ac.ir","wang, shoujin/ABH-6410-2020; Khosravi, Mohammad R./ABG-8013-2021","wang, shoujin/0000-0003-1133-9379; ","State Key Laboratory of Novel Software Technology (Nanjing University) [KFKT2019B19]","State Key Laboratory of Novel Software Technology (Nanjing University)","This paper is partially supported by the Open Project funded by State Key Laboratory of Novel Software Technology (Nanjing University, KFKT2019B19).","","45","6","6","1","12","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1022-0038","1572-8196","","WIREL NETW","Wirel.

Unlike the original test, the sign-based test does not require bootstrap-type methods to control size in the presence of time-varying volatility. Under a locally explosive alternative, the sign-based test delivers higher power than the original test for many time-varying volatility and bubble specifications. However, since the original test can still outperform the sign-based one for some specifications, we also propose a union of rejections procedure that combines the original and sign-based tests, employing a wild bootstrap to control size. This is shown to capture most of the power available from the better performing of the two tests. We also show how a sign-based statistic can be used to date the bubble start and end points.

As blockchain has characteristics, such as decentralization, security, immutability, smart contract, it is therefore expected to improve sustainable food supply chain management and food traceability. This paper applies a content-analysis based literature review in blockchain adoption within food supply chain. We propose four benefits. Blockchain can help to improve food traceability, information transparency, and recall efficiency; it can also be combined with Internet of things (IoT) to achieve better efficiency. We also propose five potential challenges, including lack of deeper understanding of blockchain, technology difficulties, raw data manipulation, difficulties of getting all stakeholders on board, and the deficiency of regulations.","[Duan, Jiang] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Blockchain Res Ctr China, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chen; Gong, Yu; Brown, Steve] Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Li, Zhi] Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Elect Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China","Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Solent University; University of Southampton; Guangdong University of Technology","Zhang, C (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.","duanj_t@swufe.edu.cn; cz3g16@soton.ac.uk; y.gong@soton.ac.uk; steve.brown@soton.ac.uk; piersli@foxmail.com","Li, Zhi/GWN-1772-2022","Zhi, Li/0000-0002-6998-9027; Gong, Yu/0000-0002-5411-376X","Southwestern University of Finance and Economics","Southwestern University of Finance and Economics","The APC was funded by Southwestern University of Finance and Economics.","","80","86","87","32","135","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1660-4601","","INT J ENV RES PUB HE","Int.

This paper introduces an innovative method DCOMB (dual combination Bloom filter) to firstly convert the computational power of bitcoin mining into the computational power of query. Furthermore, this article uses the DCOMB method to build blockchain-based IoT data query model. DCOMB can implement queries only through mining hash calculation. This model combines the data stream of the IoT with the timestamp of the blockchain, improving the interoperability of data and the versatility of the IoT database system. The experiment results show that the random reading performance of DCOMB query is higher than that of COMB (combination Bloom filter), and the error rate of DCOMB is lower.

A CMT is constructed using a family of sparse erasure codes on each layer, and is recovered by iteratively applying a peeling-decoding technique that enables a compact proof for data availability attack on any layer. Our algorithm enables any node to verify the full availability of any data block generated by the system by just downloading a Theta(1) byte block hash commitment and randomly sampling Theta(log b) bytes, where b is the size of the data block. With the help of only one connected honest node in the system, our method also allows any node to verify any tampering of the coded Merkle tree by just downloading Theta(log b) bytes.

Finally, we perform comprehensive experiments of the truncated MCMC random algorithm. The results show that in the case of multi-node, the truncated block will not affect the block chain network.

This paper makes use of a systematic literature review to identify non-cryptocurrency use cases of blockchain to establish an overview of existing or hypothesized solutions using the technology. The identified use cases are subsequently assessed on their technology readiness level (TRL) using the guidance of established research [1] to determine the maturity of individual blockchain solutions described in peer-reviewed literature. By categorizing the individual use cases into groups, a generalized assessment of maturity for different application areas is assessed for blockchain technology. The literature review and subsequent estimation of TRL revealed that there are highly mature blockchain use cases, although they are quite limited in terms of industry-wide utility. As an example, the Everledger use case has tracked over two million diamonds and is estimated to be TRL 9 (the highest level) in the specific scope of diamond provenance tracking, but other luxury-tracking blockchain initiatives are years behind this [2].","[Holm, Kristoffer] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Energy Technol, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Herning, Denmark; [Goduscheit, Rene Chester] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Herning, Denmark","Aarhus University; Aarhus University","Holm, K (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Ctr Energy Technol, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Herning, Denmark.","kh@btech.au.dk","","Goduscheit, Rene Chester/0000-0001-8639-2014","","","","","42","4","4","3","8","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-4224-1","","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","Business; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Management","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics; Engineering","BQ7NC","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000617753200032","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The traditional approach to scalability, namely sharding, does not solve the problem easily because the process of interleaving blocks stored in different shards to create a unified master ledger introduces overhead. This paper examines two techniques for interleaving the shards of permissioned blockchains, which we refer to as strong temporal coupling and weak temporal coupling. We implement these techniques in a prototype system with a Bitcoin-like transaction structure, using the EPaxos consensus protocol for transaction ordering. Our experimental results show that strong coupling can achieve lower latency as compared to weak coupling but same level of peak throughput. However, strong coupling requires all shards to grow at the same rate, and cannot tolerate any shard failure. In contrast, the higher latency of weak coupling is because of the consensus strategy it uses to order the blocks. However, if shard failure occurs, weak coupling can still make progress without stalling the whole system.","[Mao, Chunyu; Anh-Duong Nguyen; Golab, Wojciech] Univ Waterloo, Elect & Comp Engn, Waterloo, ON, Canada","University of Waterloo","Mao, CY (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Elect & Comp Engn, Waterloo, ON, Canada.","c5mao@uwaterloo.ca; ad3nguyen@uwaterloo.ca; wgolab@uwaterloo.ca","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","Authors supported by Ripple, and by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).","","15","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-6680-3","","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7IE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000848725400031","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The most two popular blockchains (Bitcoin and Ethereum) are Proof-of-Work (PoW) based. However, the randomness of the block produce time (BPT) greatly affects the performance, user experience, and even the security of a blockchain. Mining difficulty controls the stability of the BPT. However, the current difficulty control algorithm in Ethereum has two problems. First, the difficulty control algorithm cannot track the network hashrate fast enough. Thus, the BPT has a large variance and cannot converge to the target BPT on time. The second problem is that the target BPT cannot be flexibly set to any given value by adjusting the difficulty. To mitigate these two problems, we propose a linear predictor based difficulty control algorithm. Based on the relationship among the hashrate, the difficulty, and the BPT, the prediction based difficulty control algorithm has much better stability and flexibility on BPT. It is also shown that the proposed prediction based algorithm outperforms the existing Ethereum one in the real situation.","[Zheng, Kaiwen; Ma, Xiaoli] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Zhang, Shulai] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China","University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Shanghai Jiao Tong University","Zheng, KW (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.","kzheng71@gatech.edu; zslzsl1998@sjtu.edu.cn; xiaoli@gatech.edu","","","","","","","9","0","0","0","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2325-3789","","978-1-7281-5478-7","IEEE INT WORK SIGN P","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BQ8JB","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000620337500058","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, the classical consensus method of blockchain, that is, Proof-of-Work, as implemented in Bitcoin, has a significant impact on energy consumption and compromises the scalability, efficiency, and latency of the system. In this paper, we propose a hybrid consensus model (PSC-Bchain) composed of Proof of Credibility and Proof of Stake that work mutually to address the aforementioned problems to secure e-voting systems. Smart contracts are used to provide a trustworthy public bulletin board and a secure computing environment to ensure the accuracy of the ballot outcome. We combine a sharding mechanism with the PSC-Bchain hybrid approach to emphasize security, thus enhancing the scalability and performance of the blockchain-based e-voting system. Furthermore, we compare and discuss the execution of attacks on the classical blockchain and our proposed hybrid blockchain, and analyze the security. Our experiments yielded new observations on the overall security, performance, and scalability of blockchain-based e-voting systems.","[Abuidris, Yousif; Kumar, Rajesh; Yang, Ting] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Onginjo, Joseph] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Abuidris, Yousif] Univ Gadarif, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Al Qadarif, Sudan","University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China","Abuidris, Y (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China.","yousif_cs@std.uestc.edu.cn","","Abuidris Elmustafa, Yousif Osman/0000-0001-9809-6642","SiChuan Department of Science and Technology [2018GZ0218]","SiChuan Department of Science and Technology","SiChuan Department of Science and Technology, Grant/Award Number: 2018GZ0218","","45","9","9","4","20","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1225-6463","2233-7326","","ETRI J","ETRI J.","APR","2021","43","2","","","","","357","370","","10.4218/etrij.2019-0362","http://dx.doi.org/10.4218/etrij.2019-0362","","NOV 2020","14","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Engineering; Telecommunications","RN4XM","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000594952700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This can be done by injecting a malicious javascript code into the website. The malicious javascript code injected utilizes system's resources in order to compute hashes. Most of the classic cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, monero, webchain are built on proof-of-work(pow) algorithm called CryptoNight, which is CPU-bound. They make use of memory-bound functions for constructing computational puzzles [1], in order to maximize profit. This total process requires a lot of disc read and write operations. Hence, we have monitored the cache activity to detect whether cryptojacking exists or not. In addition to detection, our method can also detect the CPU percentage throttle set by the attacker making it a multiclass classification problem. We have leveraged a tool called 'perf' [2] in order to measure the number of cache hits and misses. Using this methodology, we were able to detect cryptojacking corresponding to each class with an accuracy of 96.25%.","[Nukala, Venkata Sai Krishna Avinash] Univ Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA","University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati","Nukala, VSKA (corresponding author), Univ Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.","nukalavh@mail.uc.edu","","","","","","","6","1","1","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2474-025X","","978-1-7281-4760-4","IEEE CONF COMM NETW","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Telecommunications","BQ6OB","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000612838300077","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Most of its users are young children with weak immunity. Once a vaccine has a problem, it will pose a serious threat to the lives of many people. At present, the supervision of vaccine production is very simple. The vaccine production record is completely controlled by the enterprises. Enterprises only submit production records to the supervisory agency for review when the vaccine needs to be sold. Production records are easily forged and modified. In order to solve the shortcomings of traditional centralized management. We propose a supervision method for vaccine production based on double-level blockchain. At first, we have designed a double-level blockchain structure. The first level is private data of vaccine prduction enterprise, including production records and corresponding hash. The next level is public data, including production records hash and vaccine information. In this way, we make vaccine enterprise to submit production records in a timely manner without fear of privacy leaks. We avoid enterprise tampering or falsification of production records through the non-tampering features and time stamps of the blockchain. To improve the time efficiency, we propose a consensus mechanism for multi-node cooperate. The primary supervisory node provides sorting services and verifies the correctness of the blockchain replica. The ordinary supervisory node can replace the primary supervisory node when necessary, and help the primary supervisory node recovers data in case of information loss. The review node is responsible for providing complete and correct blockchain copies for other nodes. So we can avoids the problem of waste of time resources in the traditional blockchain system. In addition, in order to avoid the waste of space caused by the redundancy of the blockchain, we propose a vaccine data cutting mechanism. We use the timestamp of the blockchain and the vaccine validity period to determine if the block can be cutted. At the same time, it is also possible to judge whether the block can be cutted based on the information exchange with the vaccination institution. Through these methods, we have realized spatiotemporal efficiency supervision of vaccine production. And for the time being, research work in the field of vaccine production supervision is still very rare. So Our work is ground-breaking.","[Peng, Shaoliang; Hu, Xing; Jiang, Hongbo] Hunan Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jinglin] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Xie, Xiaolan] Guilin Univ Technol, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China; [Long, Chengnian] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Automat, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Tian, Zhihui] Zhengzhou Univ, Smart City Res Inst, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China","Hunan University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Guilin University of Technology; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Zhengzhou University","Peng, SL (corresponding author), Hunan Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China.;Zhang, JL (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.;Xie, XL (corresponding author), Guilin Univ Technol, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China.","slpeng@hnu.edu.cn; hu_xing@hnu.edu.cn; jinglin.zhang@nuist.edu.cn; xie_xiao_lan@foxmail.com; longcn@sjtu.edu.cn; iezhtian@zzu.edu.cn; hongbojiang@hnu.edu.cn","Zhang, Jinglin/AAD-2896-2021","Peng, Shaoliang/0000-0002-4647-2615","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0202602, 2018YFC0910405, 2017YFC1311003, 2016YFC1302500, 2016YFB0200400, 2017YFB0202104]; NSFC [U19A2067, 61772543, U1435222, 61625202, 61272056, 61762031]; Funds of the Peng Cheng Laboratory, State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2016B090918122]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Funds of the Peng Cheng Laboratory, State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFB0202602, Grant 2018YFC0910405, Grant 2017YFC1311003, Grant 2016YFC1302500, Grant 2016YFB0200400, and Grant 2017YFB0202104; in part by the NSFC under Grant U19A2067, Grant 61772543, Grant U1435222, Grant 61625202, Grant 61272056, and Grant 61762031; in part by the Funds of the Peng Cheng Laboratory, State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics; and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant 2016B090918122.","","16","19","19","3","34","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","1536-1241","1558-2639","","IEEE T NANOBIOSCI","IEEE Trans.

At the core of these applications are consensus protocols that securely replicate client requests among all replicas, even if some replicas are Byzantine faulty. Unfortunately, these consensus protocols typically have low throughput, and this lack of performance is often cited as the reason for the slow wider adoption of blockchain technology. Consequently, many works focus on designing more efficient consensus protocols to increase throughput of consensus. We believe that this focus on consensus protocols only explains part of the story. To investigate this belief, we raise a simple question: Can a well-crafted system using a classical consensus protocol outperform systems using modern protocols? In this tutorial, we answer this question by diving deep into the design of blockchain systems. Further, we take an in-depth look at the theory behind consensus, which can help users select the protocol that best-fits their requirements. Finally, we share our vision of high-throughput blockchain systems that operate at large scales.","[Gupta, Suyash; Hellings, Jelle; Rahnama, Sajjad; Sadoghi, Mohammad] Univ Calif Davis, Exploratory Syst Lab, Dept Comp Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA","University of California System; University of California Davis","Gupta, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Exploratory Syst Lab, Dept Comp Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.","","","Sadoghi, Mohammad/0000-0003-2779-6080","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Small Business Innovation Research [DE-SC0020455]","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Small Business Innovation Research(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This work is partially supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Small Business Innovation Research, under Award Number DE-SC0020455.","","45","5","5","2","7","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA","2150-8097","","","PROC VLDB ENDOW","Proc.

The phenomenon of startups launching Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) to raise capital led to thousands of tokens being distributed on blockchains. Many studies have analyzed this phenomenon from an economic perspective. However, little is know about the characteristics of participants in the ecosystem. To fill this gap and considering over 80% of ICOs launched based on ERC20 token on Ethereum, in this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation on the whole Ethereum ERC20 token ecosystem to characterize the token creator, holder, and transfer activity. By downloading the whole blockchain and parsing the transaction records and event logs, we construct three graphs, namely token creator graph, token holder graph, and token transfer graph. We obtain many observations and findings by analyzing these graphs. Besides, we propose an algorithm to discover potential relationships between tokens and other accounts. The reported case shows that our algorithm can effectively reveal entities and the complex relationship between various accounts in the token ecosystem.","[Chen, Weili; Chen, Zhiguang; Lu, Yutong] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Natl Supercomp Ctr Guangzhou, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tuo; Zheng, Zibin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Digital Life, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University","Chen, WL (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Natl Supercomp Ctr Guangzhou, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.","chenwli28@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; 741554448@qq.com; zhiguang.chen@nscc-gz.cn; zhzibin@mail.sysu.edu.cn; yutong.lu@nscc-gz.cn","Zheng, Zibin/E-3024-2014; Zheng, Zibin/HCH-2408-2022","Zheng, Zibin/0000-0002-7878-4330; Zheng, Zibin/0000-0002-7878-4330","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFB0204303]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61722214, U1611261, 61872392]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong [2018B030312002]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019TQ0372, 2019M660223]; Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams [2016ZT06D211]; Pearl River S & T Nova Program of Guangzhou [201906010008]","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams; Pearl River S & T Nova Program of Guangzhou","The work described in this paper was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFB0204303), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61722214, U1611261, 61872392), the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong (2018B030312002), project funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant NO. 2019TQ0372, 2019M660223), the Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams under Grant NO. 2016ZT06D211 and Pearl River S & T Nova Program of Guangzhou under Grant NO. 201906010008.

Multiple block headers are included in batches and verified off-chain, while preserving light client support. Only the validity of the off-chain computation is verified on-chain, creating a sidechain mechanism that requires constant verification costs and releases the target ledger from processing and storing every single block header of the source blockchain. Efficient Merkle proofs enable including intermediary blocks for any batch that was submitted. We provide a prototypical implementation that facilitates the verification of 504 Bitcoin headers in a single proof on Ethereum using the ZoKrates framework.

Similarly, cryptocurrencies incorporate computationally expensive consensus mechanisms, whereas, IoT nodes are limited in computation and energy. Furthermore, the classical DLs (like Bitcoin) are not quantum-resilient. This paper proposes a quantum-secure DL for IoT environments, namely DL for-IoT. The core of our design is a novel one-time signature (OTS) scheme namely, DL-OTS, which is a compact and efficient scheme. DL-OTS offer 75% reduction in signature size and 76% reduction in signature creation time, as compared to the popular Winternitz-OTS+ scheme.

However, Cryptocurrencies are not seen as an investment opportunity due to the market & x2019;s erratic behavior and high price volatility. Most of the solutions reported in the literature for price forecasting of Cryptocurrencies may not be applicable for real-time price prediction due to their deterministic nature. Motivated by the aforementioned issues, we propose a stochastic neural network model for Cryptocurrency price prediction. The proposed approach is based on the random walk theory, which is widely used in financial markets for modeling stock prices. The proposed model induces layer-wise randomness into the observed feature activations of neural networks to simulate market volatility. Moreover, a technique to learn the pattern of the reaction of the market is also included in the prediction model. We trained the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. The results show that the proposed model is superior in comparison to the deterministic models.","[Jay, Patel; Kalariya, Vasu; Parmar, Pushpendra; Tanwar, Sudeep] Nirma Univ, Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Ahmadabad 382481, Gujarat, India; [Kumar, Neeraj] Thapar Inst Engn & Technol Deemed Be Univ, Dept Comp Sci Engn, Patiala 147004, Punjab, India; [Kumar, Neeraj] Asia Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taichung 41354, Taiwan; [Kumar, Neeraj] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Informat Technol, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Alazab, Mamoun] Charles Darwin Univ, Coll Engn IT & Environm, Casuarina, NT 0810, Australia","Nirma University; Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology; Asia University Taiwan; King Abdulaziz University; Charles Darwin University","Kumar, N (corresponding author), Thapar Inst Engn & Technol Deemed Be Univ, Dept Comp Sci Engn, Patiala 147004, Punjab, India.;Kumar, N (corresponding author), Asia Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taichung 41354, Taiwan.;Kumar, N (corresponding author), King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Informat Technol, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.;Alazab, M (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Univ, Coll Engn IT & Environm, Casuarina, NT 0810, Australia.","neeraj.kumar@thapar.edu; mamoun.alazab@cdu.edu.au","Tanwar, Sudeep/AAI-6709-2020; Alazab, Mamoun/AAG-6684-2021; Kumar, Neeraj/L-3500-2016","Tanwar, Sudeep/0000-0002-1776-4651; Alazab, Mamoun/0000-0002-1928-3704; Kumar, Neeraj/0000-0002-3020-3947","Department of Corporate and Information Services, Northern Territory Government (NTG), Australia","Department of Corporate and Information Services, Northern Territory Government (NTG), Australia","This work was supported by the Department of Corporate and Information Services, Northern Territory Government (NTG), Australia.","","51","38","38","7","21","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","82804","82818","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2990659","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2990659","","","15","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","ML5JL","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000549502200092","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It allows reliability to be ensured in a decentralized manner, and expectations are high for its application in various areas beyond virtual currency, such as real estate and healthcare. However, any problem in the boundaries between the elements that constitute an entire system or in the smart contracts that are often introduced as subsystems may lead directly to significant losses in business, such as the theft of the virtual currency managed by a blockchain. Accordingly, improving the reliability of the system as a whole, including applications, is needed. Fujitsu Laboratories has developed a threat analysis method that checks a blockchain system for any problems at the time of its construction and operation, and a smart contract verification technology that exhaustively detects threats in smart contracts by using static analysis technology. These will enable blockchain developers to quickly develop systems that use blockchains with greater security. This paper describes the threat analysis method and smart contract verification technology that we have developed.","[Kozakura, Fumihiko; Fujimoto, Shingo; Nomura, Yoshihide; Yamashita, Kazuhiro] Fujitsu Labs Ltd, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan","Fujitsu Ltd; Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd","Kozakura, F (corresponding author), Fujitsu Labs Ltd, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan.","","","","","","","","3","1","1","1","1","FUJITSU LTD","KAWASAKI","1015 KAMIKODANAKU NAKAHARA-KU, KAWASAKI, 211, JAPAN","0016-2523","","","FUJITSU SCI TECH J","Fujitsu Sci.

In this context, one of the recent research works proposed LiTiChain - a new architecture for Blockchain of finite-lifetime blocks with applications to Edge-IoT. The novelty of LiTiChain lies in ensuring the connectivity of the chain even after the expired blocks are deleted from the chain. To provide the same level of security as conventional blockchain, in LiTiChain, some blocks are stored longer than their lifetime, which incurs additional storage cost. This paper presents two new blockchain architectures i.e. p-iTiChain and s-LiTiChain that are variants of LiTiChain. The proposed architectures offer a degree of freedom in the design of blockchain of finite-lifetime blocks in terms of a tradeoff between storage cost, security and computational cost. With extensive simulations and analysis, it is demonstrated that the proposed architectures have the potential to decrease the additional storage cost incurred by LiTiChain to zero and improve security at the expense of computational cost.","[Garlapati, Shravan] Qualcomm Technol Inc, San Diego, CA 92121 USA","Qualcomm","Garlapati, S (corresponding author), Qualcomm Technol Inc, San Diego, CA 92121 USA.","gshra09@vt.edu","","","","","","","21","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1095-2055","","978-1-7281-6607-0","IEEE IC COMP COM NET","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BR0BY","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000627816700043","View Full Record in Web of Science"

As a result, our treatment delineates exactly how the security guarantees of the protocol depend on the properties of the underlying ledger and the frequent availability of the protocol participants. Moreover, we provide a complete and modular description of the core of the lightning protocol that highlights precisely its dependency to underlying basic cryptographic primitives such as igital signatures, pseudorandom functions, identity-based signatures and a less common two-party primitive, which we term a combined digital signature, that were originally hidden within the lightning protocol's implementation.","[Kiayias, Aggelos; Litos, Orfeas Stefanos Thyfronitis] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Kiayias, Aggelos] IOHK, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","University of Edinburgh","Kiayias, A (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.;Kiayias, A (corresponding author), IOHK, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.","akiayias@inf.ed.ac.uk; o.thyfronitis@ed.ac.uk","","","","","","","40","6","6","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1940-1434","2374-8303","978-1-7281-6572-1","P IEEE COMPUT SECUR","","","2020","","","","","","","334","349","","10.1109/CSF49147.2020.00031","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CSF49147.2020.00031","","","16","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BQ8OM","","Green Accepted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000621174200023","View Full Record in Web of Science"

I focus here on payments being halted and deferred because of U.S. embargo restrictions that prevent correspondent relationships with Cuban retail banks and constantly flag transactions initiated in Cuba. Cubans and visitors to Cuba operating on these digital platforms are therefore exposed to new risks and forms of precarity. In the absence of a robust payment infrastructure, electronic transactions between the two countries have to be propped up and secured by networks of cash circulation. A social infrastructure of trust and informal networks emerges through which digital payment rails get repurposed to settle accounts, particularly when electronic payments get detained. This complicates the premise that cashless futures make payments more inclusive, efficient, secure, or in some cases decentralized, by showing how the histories of U.S. sanctions impede and cripple the ways electronic payment infrastructures work in practice, creating forms of exclusion for those located in prohibited regions of the globe.","[Tankha, Mrinalini] Portland State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Portland, OR 97201 USA","Portland State University","Tankha, M (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Portland, OR 97201 USA.","mtankha@pdx.edu","","","Portland State University","Portland State University","The research for this article was supported by Portland State University.

Design/methodology/approach This paper investigates how cryptocurrencies facilitate financial crime through a qualitative study consisting of interviews with 10 presumed providers of illegal financial services and 18 international compliance experts. Findings This study shows that cryptocurrencies are a highly suitable vehicle for money laundering, terrorist financing and corruption and that current compliance efforts in the cryptocurrency sector are ineffective. Research limitations/implications The presented findings illustrate that for a more effective combat of financial crime via cryptocurrency, an international standard for blockchain and cryptocurrency regulation must be created. This paper suggests that Liechtenstein's innovative and comprehensive blockchain act could be used as a basis for said standard. Practitioners should also consider cooperating transnationally when prosecuting financial crime via cryptocurrency. Originality/value The fact that cryptocurrencies facilitate financial crime is widely known. However, this study combines the perspectives of both compliance experts and presumed criminals to gain a comprehensive understanding of the techniques that money launderers, terrorist financiers and corrupt public officials use. This paper examines the potential for the innovative Liechtenstein blockchain act, which has, thus, far not received empirical attention, to set the benchmark for international regulations.","[Teichmann, Fabian Maximilian Johannes; Falker, Marie-Christin] Teichmann Int Schweiz AG, St Gallen, Switzerland","","Falker, MC (corresponding author), Teichmann Int Schweiz AG, St Gallen, Switzerland.","teichmann@post.harvard.edu; falker@teichmann-law.ch","Falker, Marie-Christin/ABA-7716-2021","Falker, Marie-Christin/0000-0001-5017-1615","","","","","55","8","8","6","31","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1758-7808","1368-5201","","J MONEY LAUND CONTRO","J.

To avoid the revenges from the criminals, it is necessary to study the anonymous reporting scheme with anonymous rewarding. In this paper, for the first time, we propose the novel concept of blockchain-based anonymous reporting scheme with anonymous rewarding (BB2AR). Our BB2AR scheme solves the open problem: how to realize the anonymous reporting and the anonymous rewarding simultaneously? First, we formalize the system model, definition, and security model of BB2AR. Second, we propose a concrete BB2AR scheme based on the elliptic curve public key cryptography. Our formal proof shows that our BB2AR scheme satisfies the anonymous reporting and the anonymous rewarding simultaneously. Finally, we analyze its efficiency and provide its prototype implementation. From the comparison, our BB2AR scheme is more efficient and practical.","[Wang, Huaqun] Guizhou Univ, Guizhou Prov Key Lab Publ Big Data, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China; [Wang, Huaqun; Guo, Rui] Xian Univ Posts & Telecommun, Shaanxi Key Lab Informat Commun Network & Secur, Xian 710121, Peoples R China; [Wang, Huaqun] Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Coll Comp, Jiangsu Key Lab Big Data Secur & Intelligent Proc, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [He, Debiao] Wuhan Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhe] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China","Guizhou University; Xi'an University of Posts & Telecommunications; Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Wuhan University; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics","Wang, HQ (corresponding author), Guizhou Univ, Guizhou Prov Key Lab Publ Big Data, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China.;Wang, HQ (corresponding author), Xian Univ Posts & Telecommun, Shaanxi Key Lab Informat Commun Network & Secur, Xian 710121, Peoples R China.","wanghuaqun@aliyun.com; hedebiao@163.com; sduliuzhe@gmail.com; guorui@xupt.edu.cn","He, Debiao/F-6355-2011","He, Debiao/0000-0002-2446-7436; wang, huaqun/0000-0001-7254-6465; Guo, Rui/0000-0003-2603-2775","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61872192, 61501333, 61572379, 61802180]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20181394, BK20180421]; Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province; 1311 Talent Plan Foundation of NUPT; Foundation of Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Big Data [2018BDKFJJ010]; Opening Project of Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Information Communication Network and Security [ICNS201806]; National Cryptography Development Fund [MMJJ20180105]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [NE2018106]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province; 1311 Talent Plan Foundation of NUPT; Foundation of Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Big Data; Opening Project of Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Information Communication Network and Security; National Cryptography Development Fund; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","The work of H.

However, the security and privacy of data generated by various applications in VSNs is a great challenge, which blocks the further development of VSNs. The emerging blockchain technology seems to be a good catalyst for the development of VSN with its high security and irreversible features, which can be also a data management tool for rapidly generated data of VSNs with tamper proof. However, the full duplicates of blockchain data need to be stored in each node to ensure security, which is unacceptable for vehicles with limited resource. In this paper, to address the above storage challenge, a lightweight Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based blockchain (LDV) is proposed for resource-constrained VSNs. Specifically, based on the in-depth analysis of VSNs, we propose the social-based data reduction approach. In detail, each node only stores the interested data within the topic groups of interest and ignores the irrelevant data. To avoid the huge storage cost within large-scale groups with large amounts of data, we further present the historical data pruning method within a group, which meets the storage requirement by reducing the number of duplicates stored in each node. Experimental results show that LDV can save 97.13% storage space and has good scalability.","[Yang, Wenhui; Dai, Xiaohai; Xiao, Jiang; Jin, Hai] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Serv Comp Technol & Syst Lab, Natl Engn Res Ctr Big Data Technol & Syst, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Yang, Wenhui; Dai, Xiaohai; Xiao, Jiang; Jin, Hai] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Cluster & Grid Comp Lab, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China","Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology","Xiao, J (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Serv Comp Technol & Syst Lab, Natl Engn Res Ctr Big Data Technol & Syst, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.;Xiao, J (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Cluster & Grid Comp Lab, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.","ywh@hust.edu.cn; daixh@hust.edu.cn; jiangxiao@hust.edu.cn; hjin@hust.edu.cn","","Xiao, Jiang/0000-0002-4216-0497; Dai, Xiaohai/0000-0001-7822-4512","Technology Innovation Project of Hubei Province of China [2019AEA171]; National Science Foundation of China [2018YFB1004805, 61702203]; Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundations [2018CFB133]","Technology Innovation Project of Hubei Province of China; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundations","This work was supported by the Technology Innovation Project of Hubei Province of China under Grant 2019AEA171, in part by the National Science Foundation of China under Grants 2018YFB1004805 and 61702203, and in part by Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundations under Grant 2018CFB133.","","30","23","24","8","25","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","0018-9545","1939-9359","","IEEE T VEH TECHNOL","IEEE Trans.

However, the blockchain technologies today still have distinct limitations on scalability and flexibly in terms of large-size and dynamic reconfigurability. Sharding appears to be a promising solution to scale out the blockchain system horizontally by dividing the entire network into multiple shards or clusters. However, flexibility and reconfigurability of these clusters need further research and investigations. In this paper, we propose two efficient mechanisms to enable flexible dynamic re-clustering of the blockchain network including blockchain cluster merging and splitting operations. Such mechanisms offer a solution to specific application scenarios such as microgrids and other edge-based applications where clusters of autonomous systems potentially require structure reconfigurations. The proposed mechanisms offer three-stage procedures to merge and split multiple clusters. Based on our simulation experiments, we show that the proposed merging and splitting operations based on proof of work (PoW) consensus algorithm can be optimized to reduce the merging time considerably (in the magnitude of 1/22000 based on 100 blocks) which effectively reduces overall merging and splitting completion time, interruption time and required computation power.","[Saadat, Khalil; Wang, Ning; Tafazolli, Rahim] Univ Surrey, Inst Commun Syst, Home 5G Innovat Ctr, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Wei, Xinpeng; Da, Bin] Huawei Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China","University of Surrey; Huawei Technologies","Saadat, K (corresponding author), Univ Surrey, Inst Commun Syst, Home 5G Innovat Ctr, Guildford, Surrey, England.","khalil.saadat@surrey.ac.uk; n.wang@surrey.ac.uk; weixinpeng@huawei.com; dabin@huawei.com; r.tafazolli@surrey.ac.uk","","","University of Surrey 5G Innovation Centre (5GIC)","University of Surrey 5G Innovation Centre (5GIC)","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the University of Surrey 5G Innovation Centre (5GIC) (http://www.surrey.ac.uk/5gic) members for this work.","","15","0","0","0","1","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","2158-9178","","978-1-6654-1485-2","IEEE INT SYMP PARAL","","","2020","","","","","","","925","931","","10.1109/ISPA-BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom51426.2020.00142","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISPA-BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom51426.2020.00142","","","7","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS0RK","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000684021500116","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A blockchain system implements a tamper-evident ledger for recording transactions that modify some global states. The system captures the entire evolution history of the states. The management of that history, also known as data provenance or lineage, has been studied extensively in database systems. However, querying data history in existing blockchains can only be done by replaying all transactions. This approach is feasible for large-scale, offline analysis, but is not suitable for online transaction processing. We present LineageChain, a fine-grained, secure, and efficient provenance system for blockchains. LineageChain exposes provenance information to smart contracts via simple interfaces, thereby enabling a new class of blockchain applications whose execution logics depend on provenance information at runtime. LineageChain captures provenance during contract execution and stores it in a Merkle tree. LineageChain provides a novel skip list index that supports efficient provenance queries. We have implemented LineageChain on top of Hyperledger Fabric and a blockchain-optimized storage system called ForkBase. We conduct extensive evaluation, demonstrating benefits of LineageChain, its efficient querying, and its small storage overhead.","[Ruan, Pingcheng; Lin, Qian; Ooi, Beng Chin] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Tien Tuan Anh Dinh] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Singapore, Singapore; [Zhang, Meihui] Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Gang] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","National University of Singapore; Singapore University of Technology & Design; Beijing Institute of Technology; Zhejiang University","Ruan, PC (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.","ruanpc@comp.nus.edu.sg; dinhtta@sutd.edu.sg; linqian@comp.nus.edu.sg; meihui_zhang@bit.edu.cn; cg@zju.edu.cn; ooibc@comp.nus.edu.sg","Dinh, Tien Tuan Anh/AAB-1363-2022","Dinh, Tien Tuan Anh/0000-0002-8158-3636","Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 3 under MOE's official grant [MOE2017-T3-1-007]","Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 3 under MOE's official grant(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","This research is supported by Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 3 under MOE's official grant number MOE2017-T3-1-007.","","11","4","4","4","9","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA","0163-5808","1943-5835","","SIGMOD REC","Sigmod Rec.","MAR","2020","49","1","","","SI","","70","77","","10.1145/3422648.3422665","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3422648.3422665","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science","OH5HC","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000582611500016","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Signaling through inventory being only tenable when inventory transactions are verifiable at low enough cost, we then turn our attention to how this verifiability can be achieved in practice and argue that blockchain technology could enable it more efficiently than traditional monitoring mechanisms. To demonstrate, we develop b_verify, an open-source blockchain protocol that leverages Bitcoin to provide supply chain transparency at scale and in a cost-effective way. The paper identifies an important benefit of blockchain adoption-by opening a window of transparency into a firm's supply chain, blockchain technology furnishes the ability to secure favorable financing terms at lower signaling costs.

In this article, through an in-depth investigation of the technology innovation evaluation process, we utilize a grounded theory approach to study 12 financial service organizations. This article is unique in that it explores the technology evaluation process concurrently as decision makers reacted to the potential uses, as opposed to a retrospective view after a technology innovation had been adopted. Evidence suggests that, organizations applied a specific process to determine the value of blockchain that consisted of understand, organize, and test, which collectively helped create the proof-of-value model. Surprisingly, we find that financial service organizations tend to view blockchain innovation as a lower priority due to the lack of a clear path to value. Additionally, financial service organizations consistently leverage industry consortiums to link to external knowledge and help with the decision-making process.

Moreover, the synchrophasors are vulnerable to a single point of failure. Blockchain, the main technology behind the bitcoin, can simultaneously ensure reliability, security, and integrity with decentralization properties in a peer-to-peer system. Therefore, to mitigate the issues in the synchrophasor network, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based synchrophasor network protection framework to enhance the self-defensive capability of its monitoring system. Our proposed model can mitigate data manipulation attacks from malicious entities by introducing bloom filter based fast phasor data identity validation, and Merkle tree-based fast data verification. Finally, the blockchain consensus can help to keep the consistency in the system and eliminate malicious entities from manipulating the overall security of the protection framework.

Hence, this classical byzantine agreement algorithm seems to be infeasible to achieve scale-out performance with the same level of security as a Bitcoin. In order to improve the performance degradation due to a large amount of traffic, we propose the hierarchical consensus mechanism based on service-zone sharding rather than how all nodes participate in the consensus process. In the proposed consensus mechanism (SZHBFT), a disjoint set of transactions is locally processed by a secure consensus subgroup or globally processed between consensus subgroups. Thus, the transactions that occur related to multiple Service-Zone Consensus Groups are updated and maintained in the Inter-Service Zone Public Ledger, whereas service transactions occurring locally are processed in parallel by each Service-Zone Consensus Group and then distributed into a local Service-Zone Private Ledger. The scheme of the proposed SZHBFT mechanism provides the hierarchical agreement solution along with distributed multiledger structure for the scalable byzantine resilient agreement by forming secure consensus subgroups in order to minimize the overhead of overall communication messages.","[Kwak, Ji-Young; Yim, Jongchoul; Ko, Nam-Seok; Kim, Sun-Me] Elect & Telecommun Res Inst ETRI, Daejeon 34129, South Korea","Electronics & Telecommunications Research Institute - Korea (ETRI)","Kwak, JY (corresponding author), Elect & Telecommun Res Inst ETRI, Daejeon 34129, South Korea.","jiyoung@etri.re.kr; hektor@etri.re.kr; nsko@etri.re.kr; kimsunme@etri.re.kr","","","ICT R&D program of MSICT/IITP [2017-0-00045]","ICT R&D program of MSICT/IITP","work was supported by ICT R&D program of MSICT/IITP (2017-0-00045, Hyper-connected Intelligent Infrastructure Technology Development).","","27","4","4","4","21","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","0018-9391","1558-0040","","IEEE T ENG MANAGE","IEEE Trans.

Nevertheless, the users of machine learning usually find that these sophisticated techniques could incur a high level of tensions caused by the selection of the appropriate size of the training data set among other factors. In this paper, we provide a systematic way of resolving such tensions by examining practical examples of predicting popularity and sentiment of posts on Twitter and Facebook, blogs on Mashable, news on Google and Yahoo, the US house survey, and Bitcoin prices. Interesting results show that for the case of big data, using around 20% of the full sample often leads to a better prediction accuracy than opting for the full sample. Our conclusion is found to be consistent across a series of experiments. The managerial implication is that using more is not necessarily the best and users need to be cautious about such an important sensitivity as the simplistic approach may easily lead to inferior solutions with potentially detrimental consequences.","[Wang, Huamao] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Univ Business Sch, Global Ctr Banking & Financial Innovat GCBFI, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Yao, Yumei] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Salhi, Said] Univ Kent, Ctr Logist & Heurist Optimisat CLHO, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury CT2 7FS, Kent, England","University of Nottingham; University of Glasgow; University of Kent","Yao, YM (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.","Huamao.Wang@nottingham.ac.uk; y.yao.1@research.gla.ac.uk; s.salhi@kent.ac.uk","Wang, Huamao/AAA-3509-2021","Wang, Huamao/0000-0003-0436-826X; Salhi, Said/0000-0002-3384-5240","","","","","41","7","7","3","19","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","0040-1625","1873-5509","","TECHNOL FORECAST SOC","Technol.

Due to well-known impossibility results for designing P2P primitives in unrestricted byzantine settings, research has explored many adversarial models with additional assumptions, ranging from mild (such as pre-established PKI) to strong (such as the existence of common random coins). One such widely-studied model is the general-omission model, which yields simple protocols with good efficiency, but has been considered impractical or unrealizable since it artificially limits the adversary only to omitting messages. In this work, we study the setting of a synchronous network wherein peer nodes have CPUs equipped with a recent trusted computing mechanism called Intel SGX. In this model, we observe that the byzantine adversary reduces to the adversary in the general-omission model. As a first result, we show that by leveraging SGX features, we eliminate any source of advantage for a byzantine adversary beyond that gained by omitting messages, making the general-omission model realizable.

Already, blockchain technology-based applications in supply chain management, marketing, and finance are decentralizing and streamlining vital institutional functions. In this paper, we examine the economics of blockchain technologies as it pertains to transaction costs in startup financing. We draw upon the theory of transaction cost economics and the transactional nature of blockchain technology to propose a model to demonstrate how and why blockchain technology based applications are effective. We then apply the model to demonstrate how blockchain technology can be used to overcome many problems inherent in startup financing. For example, information asymmetry and transaction costs involved with matching an entrepreneur with an investor and the terms of the financing deal are some of the fundamental issues in entrepreneurial financing.

While current research on this topic is still growing, various security concerns have been raised and the security of blockchains has been becoming the most important issue which must be well addressed. Blockchain transactions are based on digital signatures, where the public key is associated with the ownership of the digital coin. User management of public or permissionless blockchain is ad hoc, i.e., any user can join and leave the blockchain network and participate in the Proof of Work (PoW). However, in a private blockchain and a permissioned blockchain, there are usually some constraints for users. In this paper, we investigate a scenario which provides a blockchain network with a set of policies where every user's signing key is associated with a policy set. It is particularly interesting while users are working in different sectors. We call our scheme as policy-driven, since policies in our scheme restrict users' rights. Our system is featured with a novel and lightweight policy-driven signature (PDS) scheme whose security has been proven formally.

The most notable application of blockchain is in the development and operation of cryptocurrencies (e.g. bitcoin, ethereum, among others). Besides the financial services industry, blockchain is also considered in other sectors such as international trade, taxation, supply chain management, business operations and governance. However, blockchain has not been examined comprehensively in all areas of relevant literature. This article conducts a survey of the literature to gain an understanding of the opportunities and issues presented by blockchain in various business functions. The article begins by providing a discussion regarding how the blockchain technology operates. The paper takes a broad focus in its analysis of the prospects of blockchain for various business functions, including banking and the capital markets, corporate governance, international trade, and taxation. The paper demonstrates how organisations and regulators can leverage blockchain to upscale business operations, enhance efficiency and reduce operational costs. The key drawbacks of blockchain that stakeholders need to bear in mind before adopting the technology are also highlighted. The article also reflects on how organisations can tap into blockchain to reap the full potential of the fourth industrial revolution.","[Kimani, Danson] Univ Essex, Essex Business Sch, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Adams, Kweku] Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield Business Sch, Dept Management, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England; [Attah-Boakye, Rexford] Univ Hull, Hull Univ Business Sch, Accounting & Finance Subject Grp, Cottingham Rd, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Ullah, Subhan; Frecknall-Hughes, Jane; Kim, Ja] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Univ Business Sch, Accounting Div, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England","University of Essex; University of Huddersfield; University of Hull; University of Nottingham","Ullah, S (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Univ Business Sch, Accounting Div, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.","subhan.ullah@nottingham.ac.uk","Kimani, Danson/AAD-7959-2021","Kimani, Danson/0000-0002-8267-4150; Ullah, Dr Subhan/0000-0002-9657-8274; Kim, Ja Ryong/0000-0001-9527-6998; Adams, Kweku/0000-0002-3737-954X","","","","","174","39","42","10","82","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","0040-1625","1873-5509","","TECHNOL FORECAST SOC","Technol.

We first validate these measures against synthetic data. Then we apply these measures to detect statistical causality between social sentiment changes and cryptocurrency returns. We validate results by performing permutation tests by shuffling the time series, and calculate the Z-score. We also investigate different approaches for partitioning in non-parametric density estimation which can improve the significance. Using these techniques on sentiment and price data over a 48-month period to August 2018, for four major cryptocurrencies, namely bitcoin (BTC), ripple (XRP), litecoin (LTC) and ethereum (ETH), we detect significant information transfer, on hourly timescales, with greater net information transfer from sentiment to price for XRP and LTC, and instead from price to sentiment for BTC and ETH.

In the present study, all the articles published in the top eight information system journals were investigated based on their topics and methodologies using a literature analysis approach, and the most common topics and methodologies in such studies were then detected. The main topics addressed in this field were electronic commerce/business, information system research, and IS usage/adoption, and the survey was the dominant research methodology in this regard. Furthermore, an increase in the use of the mathematical models indicates that more accurate quantitative research methods have made this field more mature. The research findings also show that the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, social media, bitcoin and block chain, digital transformation, sharing economy, digital platform, methodology of machine learning, data mining, and text mining are the main research topics and methods which should be further studied.","[Mazaheri, Elham; Lagzian, Mohammad; Hemmat, Zahra] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Dept Management, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran","Ferdowsi University Mashhad","Mazaheri, E (corresponding author), Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Dept Management, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran.","e.mazaheri@mail.um.ac.ir","","","","","","","30","9","9","2","8","UNIV CANBERRA, FAC INFORMATION SCIENCES & ENGINEERING","BRUCE","BLDG 11, KIRINARI ST, BRUCE, ACT 2617, AUSTRALIA","1449-8618","1326-2238","","AUSTRALAS J INF SYST","Australas.

However, these applications require certain aspects, such as high transaction throughput or data privacy, that early BC implementations (e.g., Bitcoin) did not provide. Thus, a myriad of novel BC implementations was developed, which introduced the issue of choosing the right implementation for a specific use-case. This paper presents a framework, called PleBeuS, to address this selection issue by allowing users to specify policies that rule the automatic selection of the BC that data will be stored. The selection process relies on a cost-aware approach and considers both public and private implementations and their technical characteristics. Moreover, PleBeuS communicates with a BC-agnostic interoperability API to enforce transactions. The evaluation of the PleBeuS prototype showed that it is possible to automatically select a BC-based on user policies, considering cost thresholds and technical details (e.g., BC throughput, deployment), and reduce manual interaction.","[Scheid, Eder J.; Lakic, Daniel; Rodrigues, Bruno B.; Stiller, Burkhard] Univ Zurich UZH, Commun Syst Grp CSG, Dept Informat IfI, Binzmuhlestr 14, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland","University of Zurich","Scheid, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Zurich UZH, Commun Syst Grp CSG, Dept Informat IfI, Binzmuhlestr 14, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.","scheid@ifi.uzh.ch; daniel_lakic@access.uzh.ch; rodrigues@ifi.uzh.ch; stiller@ifi.uzh.ch","John Scheid, Eder/AAH-1972-2019","John Scheid, Eder/0000-0002-7989-5286; Bastos Rodrigues, Bruno/0000-0003-3277-3799","Komission fur Technologie und Innovation (KTI), Switzerland [26996.L PFES-ED]","Komission fur Technologie und Innovation (KTI), Switzerland","This work has been supported by Komission fur Technologie und Innovation (KTI), Switzerland (CTI-No. 26996.L PFES-ED).

In particular, LDPC codes are taken as examples to explicitly demonstrate the scheme. The proposed coding scheme encodes data across multiple blocks, respectively, block headers, in the blockchain. This leads to a significant reduction in required memory at each node. We then apply the proposed coding technique to blockchains organized in two different ways. Our first scheme has the same protocol for mining, broadcasting, and verification of blocks, as Bitcoin-type blockchains. Our scheme is different in that full nodes do not have to store all blocks. Instead they will need to store only one block of a group of t blocks. In the second scheme, we consider a new block verification protocol and an account-based model under the assumption that transmission between any two nodes can be established, as well as the broadcast transmission. Our block verification protocol uses the Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm and requires sending a newly mined block to only a small number of verification nodes, instead of broadcasting it to the entire network, which leads to a reduction of the network load.","[Wu, Huihui; Wang, Xiaodong] Columbia Univ, Dept Elect Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Wu, Huihui] McGill Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Montreal, PQ H3A 0E9, Canada; [Ashikhmin, Alexei] Nokia Bell Labs, Commun & Stat Sci Res Dept, Murray Hill, NJ 07974 USA; [Li, Chong; Yang, Sichao; Zhang, Lei] Nakamoto & Turing Labs, New York, NY 10036 USA","Columbia University; McGill University; Nokia Corporation; Nokia Bell Labs","Wang, XD (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Elect Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA.","huihui.wu.phd@gmail.com; alexei.ashikhmin@nokia-bell-labs.com; wangx@ee.columbia.edu; chongl@ntlabs.io; ysc@ntlabs.io; leizha@ntlabs.io","","","Columbia-IBM Blockchain Center; Nakamoto Turing Labs","Columbia-IBM Blockchain Center(International Business Machines (IBM)); Nakamoto Turing Labs","This work was supported in part by the Columbia-IBM Blockchain Center and in part by Nakamoto & Turing Labs.","","39","7","11","5","17","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2327-4662","","","IEEE INTERNET THINGS","IEEE Internet Things J.","AUG","2020","7","8","","","","","7054","7071","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2982067","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.2982067","","","18","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","NA0AJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000559482800030","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this study, we introduce a new implication of using blockchain technology and propose two unique contributions. First, we introduce the notion of computational costs (measured in units of gas) as an essential mechanism for completing operational transactions in the blockchain environment. Second, we discuss the use of smart contracts and their influence on operational transactions. To investigate the link between blockchain transaction and computational costs, this study uses an experimental methodology. We develop and implement a fully functional virtual public blockchain to store, validate, and maintain transactions. The methodology provides a process to measure the computational costs, frequency, and intensity of transactions. This research contributes to conceptual research on the blockchain implementation paradigm. Its novelty stems from the identification of computational costs for operational transactions and use of an experimental methodology.

Thus, different proposals, both from Academia and Industry, were deployed to allow the adoption of blockchain in Health Care applications. However, there are few discussions about incentive methods to help to motivate new users to adopt health-care systems. Also, little is discussed about performance to execute codes in private and public blockchains. In order to tackle these issues, this work presents an evaluation of TokenHealth, an application for collaborative health practice monitoring with gamification and token-based incentives, on different Ethereum networks. The proposed solution is implemented through smart contracts using the Solidity language and executed using Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). We evaluated the performance of both in the Ropsten test network and in a private Ethereum instance. The preliminary results show that the execution of smart contracts takes less than a minute for a full cycle of different smart contracts.

While this paradigm has been widely adopted in industry, it has not been carefully analyzed in terms of its network scaling with respect to the number of peers. Applications for blockchain systems, such as cryptocurrencies and IoT, require this form of network scaling. In this paper, we propose a new stochastic network model for a blockchain system. We identify a structural property called one-endedness, which we show to be desirable in any blockchain system as it is directly related to distributed consensus among the peers. We show that the stochastic stability of the network is sufficient for the one-endedness of a blockchain. We further establish that our model belongs to a class of network models, called monotone separable models. This allows us to establish upper and lower bounds on the stability region. The bounds on stability depend on the connectivity of the P2P network through its conductance and allow us to analyze the scalability of blockchain systems on large P2P networks.

This enables new areas of blockchain use with a focus on building trust between individuals. Our innovative approach offers scalability, openness and Sybil-resistance while replacing proof-of-work with a mechanism to establish the validity and integrity of transactions. TrustChain is a permission-less tamper-proof data structure for storing transaction records of agents. We create an immutable chain of temporally ordered interactions for each agent. It is inherently parallel and every agent creates his own genesis block. TrustChain includes a novel Sybil-resistant algorithm named NetFlow to determine trustworthiness of agents in an online community. NetFlow ensures that agents who take resources from the community also contribute back. We demonstrate that irrefutable historical transaction records offer security and seamless scalability, without requiring global consensus. Experimentation shows that the transaction throughput of TrustChain surpasses that of traditional blockchain architectures like Bitcoin. We show by using extracted data from a live network that TrustChain has sufficient informativeness to identify freeriders, leading to refusal of service. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This ransomware infiltrates the victim's system with smartly-designed methods and encrypts the files found in the system. After the encryption process, the attacker leaves a message demanding a ransom in virtual currency to open access to the encrypted files and warns that otherwise the files will not be accessible. This type of ransomware is becoming more popular over time, so currently it is the largest information technology security threat. In the literature, there are many studies about detection and analysis of this cyber-bullying. In this study, we focused on crypto-ransomware and investigated a forensic analysis of a current attack example in detail. In this example, the attack method and behavior of the crypto-ransomware were analyzed and it was identified that information belonging to the attacker was accessible. With this dimension, we think our study will significantly contribute to the struggle against this threat.","[Kara, Ilker] Cankiri Karatekin Univ, Eldivan Med Serv Vocat Sch, Dept Med Serv & Tech, TR-18000 Cankiri, Turkey; [Aydos, Murat] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Comp Engn, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey","Cankiri Karatekin University; Hacettepe University","Kara, I (corresponding author), Cankiri Karatekin Univ, Eldivan Med Serv Vocat Sch, Dept Med Serv & Tech, TR-18000 Cankiri, Turkey.","karaikab@gmail.com; maydos@hacettepe.edu.tr","","","","","","","19","3","4","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-9656-5","","","","2020","","","","","","","764","769","1570677813","","","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BR4QF","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000652194300123","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, blockchain mining processes demand high hardware costs and consume a vast amount of energy (studies have shown that the amount of energy consumed in Bitcoin mining is almost the same as the electricity used in Ireland). To address the high mining cost problem of blockchain networks, in this paper, we propose a blockchain mining resources allocation algorithm to reduce the mining cost in PoW-based (proof-of-work- based) blockchain networks. We first propose an analytical queueing model for general blockchain networks. In our queueing model, transactions arrive randomly to the queue and are served in a batch manner with unknown service rate probability distribution and agnostic to any priority mechanism. Then, we leverage the Lyapunov optimization techniques to propose a dynamic mining resources allocation algorithm (DMRA), which is parameterized by a tuning parameter K > 0. We show that our algorithm achieves an [O(1/K), O(K)] cost-optimality-gap-vs-delay tradeoff. Our simulation results also demonstrate the effectiveness of DMRA in reducing mining costs.","[Fang, Minghong; Liu, Jia] Iowa State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Iowa State University","Fang, MH (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA.","","","","NSF [ECCS-1818791, CCF-1758736, CNS-1758757]; ONR [N00014-17-1-2417]; AFRL [FA8750-18-1-0107]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ONR(Office of Naval Research); AFRL(United States Department of DefenseUS Air Force Research Laboratory)","This work has been supported in part by NSF grants ECCS-1818791, CCF-1758736, CNS-1758757; ONR grant N00014-17-1-2417, and AFRL grant FA8750-18-1-0107.","","16","4","4","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1550-3607","","978-1-7281-5089-5","IEEE ICC","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BQ5PR","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000606970300015","View Full Record in Web of Science"

One of the main issues in consensus research is the many different variants of the problem that exist as well as the various ways the problem behaves when different setup, computational assumptions and network models are considered. In this work we perform a systematization of knowledge in the landscape of consensus research in the Byzantine failure model starting with the original formulation in the early 1980s up to the present blockchain-based new class of consensus protocols.

However, the initial enthusiasm around this technology is going beyond the peak of inflated expectations, towards more stable applications in money transactions, cryptocurrencies and Digital Commodity Exchanges. Essentially, misguided efforts, the overuse of blockchain, and the Bitcoin's price drop have been the main reasons for this decay in expectations. Nevertheless, the exploitation of the blockchain technology in the power systems area appears largely underexplored, furthermore, the relation to the physical asset makes the blockchain application more complex but also more reliable and related to measurable benefits. The most common applications in the power systems area relate to the energy market. When the blockchain technology is indeed applied to the energy field, the term energy blockchain is used. This article aims to propose a wide perspective about the application of the blockchain technology in the power systems area, clarifying some technical aspects concerning this promising technology, the features and applications developed so far, while focusing on the future of innovative applications in the electrical energy sector.","[Di Silvestre, Maria Luisa; Gallo, Pierluigi; Musca, Rossano; Sanseverino, Eleonora Riva; Sciume, Giuseppe; Zizzo, Gaetano] Univ Palermo, Palermo, Italy; [Guerrero, Josep M.; Vasquez, Juan C.] Aalborg Univ, Aalborg, Denmark","University of Palermo; Aalborg University","Zizzo, G (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Palermo, Italy.","gaetano.zizzo@unipa.it","Guerrero, Josep M./D-5519-2014; Guerrero, Josep M./Y-2929-2019; Vasquez, Juan C./J-2247-2014","Guerrero, Josep M./0000-0001-5236-4592; Vasquez, Juan C./0000-0001-6332-385X; ZIZZO, Gaetano/0000-0003-4413-4855; , Giuseppe/0000-0002-2384-5706; Riva Sanseverino, Eleonora/0000-0003-0113-7650","","","","","65","83","83","16","96","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","1364-0321","1879-0690","","RENEW SUST ENERG REV","Renew.

For some, the development of blockchain technologies and smart contracts suggests an opportunity for artists to protect their work from misuse and expropriation. For others, it suggests the possibility of stronger forms of digital rights management, going forward, that may negatively impact digital culture. However, this article argues that the aim of limited editions on the blockchain is not usually to institute stronger restrictions over use or a new form of digital rights management but rather to create new kinds of tradable digital assets. In turn, this trend implies a different operation of intellectual property rights with respect to digital culture, one where alienation rather than exclusion is significant, and a different operation of scarcity with respect to digital cultural goods, where their free circulation is not necessarily antithetical to profit.","[O'Dwyer, Rachel] Trinity Coll Dublin, CONNECT, Ctr Future Networks & Commun, Dublin, Ireland","Trinity College Dublin","O'Dwyer, R (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Coll Green, Dublin 2, Ireland.","rachel.odwyer@tcd.ie","","","","","","","63","11","11","8","37","SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","THOUSAND OAKS","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","1354-8565","1748-7382","","CONVERGENCE-US","Convergence","AUG","2020","26","4","","","SI","","874","894","","10.1177/1354856518795097","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1354856518795097","","","21","Communication","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Communication","MV3QO","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000556276100011","View Full Record in Web of Science"

For the first time in the scientific literature, the definition of mining is considered, taking into account its two main components: information and legal. In contrast to the definition of mining, formulated in the draft Federal law on digital financial assets, the mention of electricity consumption was excluded, because in reality there are other types of mining, which are problematic to detect on a consistently high level of energy consumption per system.","[Zatsepin, A.

Creation of digital investment tokens gave the entrepreneurs a possibility to attract investments from an unlimited number of investors in their projects. Such projects, as a rule, contain high risks; information about them does not meet the standards accepted in the financial market due to the lack of control; and investors participating in their financing are unable to assess their risks. Further-more, digital tokens are used by persons who launch illegal financing to attract investments in non-existent projects. These circumstances led to the situation, when People's Bank of China put a ban on financing by is-suing investment tokens. The analysis of regulations issued by the State Council, the People's Bank and Cyberspace Administration of the PRC showed that China developed a position that investments via digital tokens are used as a means of deceiving. The procedure of digital tokens issuing is declared as a form of illegal financing, thus, issuers and financial organizations which exchange money for tokens are subjects to criminal or administrative liability. Moreover, blockchain industry organizations are under the strict control and ought to inform Cyberspace Administration about any new products, applications or functions. Due to the fact that operations with investment digital tokens are prohibited in PRC, Chinese citizens are faced with the situation when they cannot receive judicial protection and bear all the risks associated with this. The ban on ICO, despite the fact that investors can choose jurisdictions where the use of digital tokens is allowed and legal protection is provided, shows that China considers it more appropriate for the national economy to prevent the emergence of parallel financial market inbound of country, than protection of a group of private investors.","[Alekseenko, Aleksandr P.] Vladivostok State Univ Econ & Serv, Dept Civil Law Disciplines, Vladivostok, Russia","Vladivostok State University of Economics & Services","Alekseenko, AP (corresponding author), Vladivostok State Univ Econ & Serv, Dept Civil Law Disciplines, Vladivostok, Russia.","alekseenko.a.p@gmail.com","Alekseenko, Aleksandr/ABE-7707-2020","Alekseenko, Aleksandr/0000-0003-0707-8372","","","","","8","0","0","0","3","RUSSIAN ACAD SCIENCES, INST FAR EASTERN STUDIES","MOSCOW","NAKHIMOVSKY AV, 32,, MOSCOW, 117997, RUSSIA","","","978-5-8381-0377-2","","","","2020","","","","","","","351","360","","","","","","10","Area Studies; Development Studies","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Area Studies; Development Studies","BQ4HZ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000589887800027","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The consensus algorithm, as the core module of the blockchain, has an important impact on the security, scalability, and efficiency of the blockchain network. The consensus algorithm is also a popular topic in current blockchain technology research. In existing consortium blockchains and public blockchains, the blockchain has low efficiency or poor fault tolerance because of the limitations of the consensus algorithm. To both ensure the fault tolerance of the blockchain and improve the scalability and throughput, in this paper, we propose a new type of consensus algorithm: mixed Byzantine fault tolerance (MBFT). MBFT uses sharding and layered technology. MBFT functionally partitions the nodes that participate in the consensus process and improves the scalability and efficiency without sacrificing security. MBFT also introduces a random node selection mechanism and a credit mechanism to improve security and fault tolerance.

The blockchain-based networks are considered to be secure, but the level of provided security is proportional to the number of connected nodes, the number of influential nodes and the supported amount of hash power. Thus, the knowledge of the network properties and nodes behavior is useful to protect the network from the possible attacks such as double spending attacks, DDoS attacks, 51% attacks, and Sybil attacks. In this paper, we propose nodes discovery mechanism, which performs a P2P links discovery on Ethereum main-network. For that, we developed the Search-node, a modified version of Ethereum Client that search for all participating nodes in the network, store the nodes identification in the Bucket, and then process the peer discovery method. We analyze the collected data to discover the relationship between nodes, heavily-connected nodes, nodes geo-distribution and provide network snapshots, as well as some data related to security issues and possible attacks over the influential nodes.

The solution involves creating associations of small farmers that will use green energy from photovoltaic panels for the irrigation of agricultural lands.

In recent years, parallel chain techniques have been proposed to overcome this issue. Chainweb is one of the parallel chains to be studied in this paper with a focus on security related issues. It is worth noting that existing blockchain security studies mainly focus on traditional single-chain based protocols. There are not many security related studies on parallel blockchains. This paper for the first time reveals that selfish mining attack is possible on Chainweb blockchain, to the best of our knowledge. Specifically, we propose a selfish mining attack that exclusively mines blocks on a subset of parallel chains with the same block height and achieves gain through a proper withholding strategy. We develop a mathematical model to quantitatively evaluate the performance and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack. Our results show that the attacker can gain extra mining reward when his computational power is at least 38% of the total power in Chainweb network. Under the 50% computational power restriction, the attacker's extra gain increases monotonically with its computational power.","[Wang, Suyang; Yin, Bo; Zhang, Shuai; Cheng, Yu; Cai, Lin X.] IIT, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Chicago, IL 60616 USA; [Cao, Xianghui] Southeast Univ, Sch Automat, Nanjing, Peoples R China","Illinois Institute of Technology; Southeast University - China","Wang, SY (corresponding author), IIT, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Chicago, IL 60616 USA.","swang133@hawk.iit.edu; byin@hawk.iit.edu; szhang104@hawk.iit.edu; cheng@iit.edu; lincai@iit.edu; xhcao@seu.edu.cn","","Cheng, Yu/0000-0002-4837-3370","NSF of USA [CNS-1816908, ECCS-1610874, ECCS-1554576]; Southeast University Zhongying Young Scholars Project","NSF of USA(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Southeast University Zhongying Young Scholars Project","This work was supported in part by the NSF of USA under Grants CNS-1816908, ECCS-1610874, and ECCS-1554576.; The work of Dr. Xianghui Cao was supported in part by the Southeast University Zhongying Young Scholars Project.","","16","2","2","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2334-0983","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","IEEE GLOB COMM CONF","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322246","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322246","","","6","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BR7QI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000668970501038","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Bitcoin and later blockchain frameworks, such as Ethereum, have revolutionized financial transactions. These frameworks are based on decentralized databases (blockchains) that can achieve secure consensus in peer-to-peer networks. We illustrate our approach in a collective sensing scenario where robots in a swarm are controlled via blockchain-based smart contracts (decentralized protocols executed via blockchain technology) that serve as meta-controllers and we compare it to state-of-the-art consensus protocols using a robot swarm simulator. Additionally, we show that our blockchain-based approach can prevent attacks where robots forge a large number of identities (Sybil attacks). The developed robot-blockchain interface is released as open-source software in order to facilitate future research in blockchain-controlled robot swarms. Besides increasing security, we expect the presented approach to be important for data analysis, digital forensics, and robot-to-robot financial transactions in robot swarms.","[Strobel, Volker; Ferrer, Eduardo Castello; Dorigo, Marco] Univ Libre Bruxelles, IRIDIA, Brussels, Belgium; [Ferrer, Eduardo Castello] MIT, Media Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)","Strobel, V (corresponding author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, IRIDIA, Brussels, Belgium.","vstrobel@ulb.ac.be","Strobel, Volker/AAD-1776-2019","Strobel, Volker/0000-0003-2974-9827; Castello Ferrer, Eduardo/0000-0001-9761-1980","Belgian F.R.S.-FNRS; Office of Naval Research Global under the Visiting Scientists Program [18-8-003]; Marie Sklodowska-Curie actions (EU) [BROS-DLV-751615]; FLAG-ERA project RoboCom++","Belgian F.R.S.-FNRS(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); Office of Naval Research Global under the Visiting Scientists Program(Office of Naval Research); Marie Sklodowska-Curie actions (EU); FLAG-ERA project RoboCom++","VS and MD acknowledge support from the Belgian F.R.S.-FNRS and from the FLAG-ERA project RoboCom++.

Although its beginning was linked to cryptocurrencies, its use has diversified over the recent years. There are various projects using the blockchain technology to perform document validation, electronic voting, tokenization of non-perishable goods, and many others. With its increasing use, concern arises with possible attacks that could threaten the integrity of the consensus of the chain. One of the well-known attacks to the blockchain consensus mechanism is the selfish mining attack, in which malicious nodes can deflect their behavior from the standard pattern by not immediately disclosing their newly mined blocks. This malicious behavior can result in a disproportionate share of rewards for those nodes, especially if they have a significant processing power. The goal of this paper is to present a simple heuristic to detect the presence of selfish mining attack (and variants) in blockchain networks that use the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm. The proposal is to signal when the blockchain fork height deviates from the standard, indicating when the network is under the influence of such attacks.","[Chicarino, Vanessa; Jesus, Emanuel] Brazilian Navy, Directorate Commun & Informat Technol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Albuquerque, Celio; Rocha, Antonio] Univ Fed Fluminense, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Universidade Federal Fluminense","Chicarino, V (corresponding author), Brazilian Navy, Directorate Commun & Informat Technol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.;Albuquerque, C (corresponding author), Univ Fed Fluminense, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.","vanessarlc@id.uff.br; celio@ic.uff.br; efjesus@ic.uff.br; arocha@ic.uff.br","Albuquerque, Célio/AAW-8745-2021","Albuquerque, Célio/0000-0002-7959-6569","CNPq; Capes; Faperj; Fapesp [2015/24358-7]","CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Capes(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Faperj(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)); Fapesp(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP))","This work has been supported in part by, CNPq, Capes, Faperj and Fapesp Grant 2015/24358-7.","","22","27","29","4","15","SPRINGER INT PUBL AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0003-4347","1958-9395","","ANN TELECOMMUN","Ann.

However, this Layer-two solution has its fair share of problems. Topological analysis on Lightning Network reveals that Griefing Attack is a major problem whereby an adversary intentionally exhausts the channel capacity of the network. Though the attack does not always result in a direct monetary gain of the attacker, blocking of channel capacity for several days prevents several nodes from processing any future transaction request, leading to substantial collateral damage. If the attacker is able to lock funds in multiple paths simultaneously, then a major portion of the network may get stalled, reducing the throughput. Mitigating Griefing Attack still remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose an efficient countermeasure for the attack, known as Griefing-Penalty. To realize it, we propose a new payment protocol HTLC-GP or Hashed Timelock Contract with Griefing-Penalty. It not only preserves privacy but also ensures that an attacker cannot ascribe blame on any honest party present in the path relaying the payment. We evaluate the effectiveness of griefing-penalty using different attack strategies and test it on several snapshots of Lightning Network. Our evaluation results show that loss incurred is substantially high for HTLC-GP compared to HTLC.","[Mazumdar, Subhra; Banerjee, Prabal; Ruj, Sushmita] Indian Stat Inst, Cryptol & Secur Res Unit, Kolkata, India; [Ruj, Sushmita] CSIRO, Data61, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)","Mazumdar, S (corresponding author), Indian Stat Inst, Cryptol & Secur Res Unit, Kolkata, India.","subhra.mazumdar1993@gmail.com; mail.prabal@gmail.com; Sushmita.Ruj@data61.csiro.au","","","","","","","23","0","0","0","2","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","2324-898X","","978-1-6654-0392-4","IEEE INT CONF TRUST","","","2020","","","","","","","1037","1044","","10.1109/TrustCom50675.2020.00138","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom50675.2020.00138","","","8","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BR8DU","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000671077600124","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This process is a common thing for new technologies as far as its adaptation takes time and often requires to change a usual approach to it. This article suggests a new way of safe decentralized applications development using Blockchain technologies and Ethereum platform. Ethereum platform - it's a project that is undoubtedly second best after bitcoin for a quite long period of time. Ethereum is presented as a platform for various tasks, such as maintaining a stable application performance in case of any threats. The main object of the research are the decentralized applications, build on a Ethereum platform basis using the smart-contracts algorithm. The study helped to improve an existing crypto-token allocating model which goal is acquiring more stable performance. On the basis of improved model a new method of allocating crypto-tokens in decentralized Ethereum applications was developed, defined a main stage of apps elaboration, offered an allocating crypto-token algorithm which is able to use associative tables and dictionaries.","[Cheshun, Viktor; Muliar, Ihor; Yatskiv, Vasyl; Kulyna, Serhii; Tsavolyk, Taras] Ternopil Natl Econ Univ, Dept Cyber Secur, Ternopol, Ukraine; [Shevchuk, Ruslan] Ternopil Natl Econ Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ternopol, Ukraine","Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Western Ukrainian National University; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Western Ukrainian National University","Cheshun, V (corresponding author), Ternopil Natl Econ Univ, Dept Cyber Secur, Ternopol, Ukraine.","cheshunvictor@gmail.com; betsmen555@gmail.com; vy@tneu.edu.ua; rulezz.sh@gmail.com; sersks@tneu.edu.ua; calisto2292@ukr.net","Shevchuk, Ruslan/G-5668-2017; Kulyna, Serhii/W-4996-2018","Shevchuk, Ruslan/0000-0001-5381-9528; Kulyna, Serhii/0000-0002-6162-9457; Cheshun, Viktor/0000-0002-3935-2068; Muliar, Ihor/0000-0002-6659-605X","","","","","21","1","1","1","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-6760-2","","","","2020","","","","","","","800","805","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BQ4QF","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000593848900172","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The current solution is to employ the well-known Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), represented by a trusted certificate authority (CA), to fulfill this assignment by signing the certificate for the public key after validating its owner. However, due to the centralized architecture, it raises the single-point failure problem with unpredictable threats. In this paper, we present a distributed certificate scheme, referred to as Cecoin which is inspired by the well-known Bitcoin by employing its irreversible unforgeability and public verifiability. In Cecoin, the certificates can be treated as currencies and recorded on block chain, which removes the single point failure problem. The miners can verify the validity of certificates following a set of rules to ensure ownership consistency, and allow an identity to bind multiple public-key certificates. For efficient retrieval and verification of certificates, and quick operations, we incorporate the modified Merkle Patricia tree and employ it to implement a distributed Certificate Library. To allow the owner to transfer the possession of identity, we design an online fair exchange protocol without a trusted third party. Security and efficiency analyses show that our Cecoin provides strong security with desirable efficiency.

We begin by undertaking a case study of the pharmaceutical drug industry supply chain, exploring both the proposed blockchain initiatives in it initiated by the FDA and startup companies, and the problems in the supply chain that blockchain cannot address. Drawing on this analysis, we derive an endogenous demand for auditing to overcome what we label the first mile problem (FMP) with blockchains: ensuring that the data stored on the blockchain distributed ledger is isomorphic with the real life data that it purports to represent. The first mile problem arises only when the blockchain is used to store data about physical items, especially ones involving a service component, rather than being native digital, as is the case with the genesis blockchain application, bitcoin. We show that unless it is feasible to store a digital twin of the item (Roberts, 2017), there is a role for auditors, with the training in professional skepticism, to help alleviate the first mile problem. There is no guarantee, however, that this new demand for auditing will be met by the traditional financial statement auditors. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

By popular definition, the cryptocurrency is an asset in a blockchain that can be transferred between actors on the scene of exchange and hence used as a payment instrument. Completely decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have attracted public interest and are far more successful than previous e-money. Despite the importance of these currencies, in third world countries like Iran country, people don't interest in using these types of currencies to their trading. So, in this study, we find and rank the challenges of using cryptocurrencies in international trading. To this end, the challenges of using cryptocurrencies were identified by reviewing the literature. Then, the identified factors were prioritized using the AHP technique. In general, four criteria and twenty-eight criteria were compared. The results show that technical factors are the most important criteria in comparison with the purpose; the risk-taking is the most important person reason; the negative attitude to cryptocurrencies in society is the most important social reason; the lack of sufficient funds to develop the use of cryptocurrencies, and the failure to properly find the parties to the transaction is the most important technical reason which can affect cryptocurrencies adoption in international trading.","[Tavasoli, Amirhamzeh] Islamic Azad Univ, Naraq Branch, Naraq, Iran","Islamic Azad University","Tavasoli, A (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Naraq Branch, Naraq, Iran.","tavasoli_ah@yahoo.com","","","","","","","25","0","0","2","11","UNIV NACL AUTONOMA NICARAGUA","MANAGUA","UNIV NACL AUTONOMA NICARAGUA, MANAGUA, 00000, NICARAGUA","2308-782X","","","REICE-REV ELECTRON I","REICE-Rev.

Cryptocurrencies are decentralized payment systems in which ownership is demonstrated cryptographically. An overview of ownership of payment units is stored in a data structure called blockchain. Of the thousands of cryptocurrencies, the best known are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, EOS, Cardano, NiiO, Dash, and Monero. In the past, new cryptocurrencies were most often created by modifying the parameters of another cryptocurrency and by launching a new blockchain. Nowadays, new cryptocurrencies are most commonly created as applications on another existing cryptocurrency. Such cryptocurrencies are called tokens. Creating a new cryptocurrency is easy, but its value depends on users' willingness to pay for its units. If a cryptocurrency loses its users, it becomes worthless. In this article, we analyze over 2,500 cryptocurrencies that are or were previously traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. We have explored the probability that a cryptocurrency will not survive and will be delisted from exchanges. For the different categories of cryptocurrencies according to their previous trading time on exchanges, we have determined the conditional probability of delisting within Ito 5 years. We found out that the new cryptocurrencies are the riskiest. With the increasing age of the cryptocurrency, the probability of its delisting decreases.","[Lansky, Jan] Univ Finance & Adm Prague, Dept Comp Sci & Math, Prague, Czech Republic","University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic","Lansky, J (corresponding author), Univ Finance & Adm Prague, Dept Comp Sci & Math, Prague, Czech Republic.","zizelevak@gmail.com","Lansky, Jan/A-3602-2008","Lansky, Jan/0000-0003-2485-1494","Czech Science Foundation as part of the project New Sources of Systemic Risk on Financial Markets [GA CR 16-21506S]","Czech Science Foundation as part of the project New Sources of Systemic Risk on Financial Markets","This research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation as part of the project New Sources of Systemic Risk on Financial Markets (GA CR 16-21506S).","","30","2","2","3","14","PAGEANT MEDIA LTD","LONDON","ONE LONDON WALL, LONDON, ENGLAND","1520-3255","2168-8435","","J ALTERN INVEST","J.

The scenario of innovation has been intensively investigated with regard to economic and socio-political aspects. Against the peculiar multidimensionality of the phenomenon, the paper argues that the analysis should take the opportunity of grasping a co belonging between the economic and the social. Whether they seem related to a proliferation of new forms of sociality (as in many experiences of complementary currencies) or to a disquieting desocialization (as in certain domains of the cryptocurrencies' world), the social dimensions of the new monies can be fruitfully analyzed by focusing on how they are consonant with certain basic conceptions of economic life. After a brief discussion of this point with regard to complementary currencies, the above-mentioned theoretical approach is used to investigate the cybernetic ethos of cryptocurrencies. The analysis shows that the socio-technical imaginaries of some cryptocurrencies (with particular regard to Bitcoin) call into question the relationship between human and non-human agency and are complicit with certain ideas of economic life, one of whose main traits concerns the demand for unconditionally assuring the economic and for denying the dimension of uncertainty.","[Doria, Luigi] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Linguist & Comparat Cultural Studies, Venice, Italy","Universita Ca Foscari Venezia","Doria, L (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Linguist & Comparat Cultural Studies, Venice, Italy.","luigi.doria@unive.it","","","","","","","47","1","1","2","4","COORDINAMENTO SIBA","LECCE LE","VIA VALESIO, LECCE LE, 73100, ITALY","1972-7623","2035-6609","","PARTECIP CONFL","Partecip.

Taking the Level 3 in Chinese classified protection 2.0 as an example, this paper proposes the common evaluation rules on blockchain to ensure that blockchain can meet the needs of countries to build it as critical infrastructure. Both assessment requirements and enforcement proposals are presented and analyzed from the standpoint of blockchain's core technologies, e.g., peer-to-peer network, distributed ledger, contract's scripting system, and consensus mechanism. Moreover, the assessment results on three main platforms, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger, are summarized and analyzed in compliance with the control points specified in the level 3.

In recent past, some hierarchical approaches have been explored to shard the decentralized blockchain to improve scalability. However, there is no discussion in the literature about how to determine an optimal shard size to maximize performance and how the presence of malicious or faulty nodes can impact on choosing an optimal shard size. To address these issues, this paper presents a sharding scheme and validation protocols for a hierarchical blockchain architecture named OptiShard. The hierarchy divides the network nodes into multiple disjoint shards and the majority of transactions are distributed among these shards in non-overlapped fashion. Optimal shard size is determined based on two parameters: performance and correctness of transaction validation in the presence of malicious or faulty nodes. OptiShard provides guaranteed majority of good shards, subject to a maximum allowable threshold of faulty nodes, by choosing the right shard size. It also provides a mechanism for identifying faulty shards and discarding all their transactions through the overlapping of a small fraction of transactions across all the shards. Experimental results performed on up to 800 Amazon EC2 nodes conform to the theoretical performance analyses and exhibit the impact of sharding the network on performance.","[Kantesariya, Shyam; Goswami, Dhrubajyoti] Concordia Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Concordia University - Canada","Kantesariya, S (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada.","s_kante@encs.concordia.ca; goswami@encs.concordia.ca","","","","","","","9","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-6680-3","","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7IE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000848725400052","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Bitcoin and other blockchain-based systems were presented as a trustless alternative to existing financial institutions and even governments. Yet, while the trustless nature of blockchain technology has been heavily questioned, little research has been done as to what blockchain technologies actually bring to the table in place of trust. This article draws from the extensive academic discussion on the concepts of trust and confidence to argue that blockchain technology is not a 'trustless technology' but rather a 'confidence machine'. First, the article provides a review of the multifaceted conceptualisations of trust and confidence, and the relationship between these two concepts. Second, the claim is made that blockchain technology relies on cryptographic rules, mathematics, and game-theoretical incentives in order to increase confidence in the operations of a computational system. Yet, such an increase in confidence ultimately relies on the proper operation and governance of the underlying blockchain-based network, which requires trusting a variety of actors. Third, the article turns to legal, constitutional and polycentric governance theory to explore the governance challenges of blockchain-based systems, in light of the tension between procedural confidence and trust.","[De Filippi, Primavera] CERSA Ctr dEtud & Rech Sci Adm & Polit, F-75005 Paris, France; [De Filippi, Primavera] Harvard Univ, Berkman Klein Ctr Internet & Soc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Mannan, Morshed] Leiden Univ, NL-2311 EZ Leiden, Netherlands; [Reijers, Wessel] European Univ Inst, I-50014 Fiesole, Italy","Harvard University; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; European University Institute","Mannan, M (corresponding author), Room B2-33,Steenschuur 25, NL-2311 ES Leiden, Netherlands.","m.mannan@law.leidenuniv.nl","","Mannan, Morshed/0000-0001-9700-2173","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [716350, 865856]","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC))","This research is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (Grant Agreements No. 716350 and No. 865856).

The Levy's stable distribution is one of the attractive distributions that well describes the fat tails and scaling phenomena in economic systems. In this paper, we show that the behaviors of price fluctuations in emerging cryptocurrency markets can be characterized by a non-Gaussian Levy's stable distribution with alpha similar or equal to 1.4 under certain conditions on time intervals ranging roughly from 30min to 4h. Our arguments are developed under quantitative valuation defined as a distance function using the Parseval's relation in addition to the theoretical background of the General Central Limit Theorem (GCLT). We also discuss the model-fitting for returns by employing the method based on likelihood ratios. Even though the cubic power-law model is a better fitting model than the Levy's stable model in the tail part of returns, the Levy's stable model outperforms the fit for the entire and wider range of returns. Our approach can be extended for further analysis of statistical properties and contribute to developing proper applications for financial modeling.","[Kakinaka, Shinji; Umeno, Ken] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Informat, Dept Appl Math & Phys, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan","Kyoto University","Kakinaka, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Informat, Dept Appl Math & Phys, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.","kakinaka.shinji.35e@st.kyoto-u.ac.jp","","Umeno, Ken/0000-0002-9162-1261; Kakinaka, Shinji/0000-0002-0256-1819","","","","","56","6","6","0","8","PHYSICAL SOC JAPAN","TOKYO","YUSHIMA URBAN BUILDING 5F, 2-31-22 YUSHIMA, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0034, JAPAN","0031-9015","","","J PHYS SOC JPN","J.

The exact volume of substances advertised and sold through these crypto markets is difficult to assess, at least partially, because vendors tend to maintain multiple accounts (or Sybil accounts) within and across different crypto markets. Linking these different accounts will allow us to accurately evaluate the volume of substances advertised across the different crypto markets by each vendor. In this paper, we present a multi-view unsupervised framework (eDarkFind) that helps modeling vendor characteristics and facilitates Sybil account detection. We employ a multi-view learning paradigm to generalize and improve the performance by exploiting the diverse views from multiple rich sources such as BERT, stylometric, and location representation. Our model is further tailored to take advantage of domain-specific knowledge such as the Drug Abuse Ontology to take into consideration the substance information. We performed extensive experiments and demonstrated that the multiple views obtained from diverse sources can be effective in linking Sybil accounts. Our proposed eDarkFind model achieves an accuracy of 98% on three real-world datasets which shows the generality of the approach.","[Kumar, Ramnath] Birla Inst Technol & Sci, Hyderabad, India; [Yadav, Shweta; Daniulaityte, Raminta; Thirunarayan, Krishnaprasad; Lokala, Usha] Wright State Univ, Dayton, OH 45435 USA; [Lamy, Francois] Mahidol Univ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Sheth, Amit] Univ South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA","Birla Institute of Technology & Science Pilani (BITS Pilani); University System of Ohio; Wright State University Dayton; Mahidol University; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia","Kumar, R (corresponding author), Birla Inst Technol & Sci, Hyderabad, India.","ramnathkumar181@gmail.com; shweta@knoesis.org; raminta.daniulaityte@wright.edu; flamy1978@gmail.com; t.k.prasad@wright.edu; usha@knoesis.com; amit@sc.edu","","LAMY, Francois/0000-0001-6542-1381","","","","","38","6","6","0","6","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-7023-3","","","","2020","","","","","","","1955","1965","","10.1145/3366423.3380263","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3366423.3380263","","","11","Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BQ9OC","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000626273302003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, there is still quite a bit of confusion and hype around the real security guarantees this technology offers. This is especially due to the fact that for the vast majority of existing blockchain-based consensus protocols it is really hard to find sufficiently detailed documentation that fully captures their behavior. A number of recent papers have formalized the behavior of Bitcoin-like protocols in order to rigorously study the security and privacy properties of their underlying structure, but surprisingly very little work has been devoted to the formalization of distributed ledger systems using BFT-like approaches. In this work, we focus on XRP Ledger, better known as Ripple, and take the first steps towards the complete formalization of its consensus protocol. To this end, we have investigated all the existing documentation and analyzed its source code. We present a formal description of its consensus protocol for every step. Furthermore, we provide an accurate view of its security guarantees in terms of safety and liveness and show how to increase the desired tolerance by changing the value of specific protocol parameters.","[Mauri, Lara; Cimato, Stelvio; Damiani, Ernesto] Univ Milan, Comp Sci Dept, Milan, Italy; [Damiani, Ernesto] EBTIC Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","University of Milan","Mauri, L (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Comp Sci Dept, Milan, Italy.","","Cimato, Stelvio/I-4495-2012; damiani, ernesto/AAI-5709-2020; MAURI, LARA/W-8976-2018","Cimato, Stelvio/0000-0003-1737-6218; damiani, ernesto/0000-0002-9557-6496; MAURI, LARA/0000-0002-4024-1015; Weippl, Edgar/0000-0003-0665-6126","","","","","26","5","5","0","0","SCITEPRESS","SETUBAL","AV D MANUELL, 27A 2 ESQ, SETUBAL, 2910-595, PORTUGAL","","","978-989-758-399-5","","","","2020","","","","","","","52","63","","10.5220/0008954200520063","http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0008954200520063","","","12","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP9RT","","Green Published, hybrid","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000570766300005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, users lose control of their data once outsourcing them to the cloud. Public auditing was introduced to ensure data integrity, in which a third-party auditor (TPA) is delegated to execute auditing tasks. In general, TPA generates and sends challenge information to the cloud server (CS), which proves data possession accordingly. However, the TPA may not perform public auditing protocol honestly or may even collude with CS to deceive users. Some existing public auditing schemes utilize blockchain to resist against the malicious TPA. However, the CS may guess the challenge messages and there is a risk that users' information may be leaked to the TPA during the process of auditing. In this paper, we propose a decentralized and privacy-preserving public auditing scheme based on blockchain (DBPA), in which a blockchain is utilized as an unpredictable source for the generation of (random) challenge information, and the auditor is required to record the audit process onto the blockchain. Due to the characteristics of blockchain, users can check the audit results publicly. Moreover, zero-knowledge proof is used in DBPA to protect user's privacy during the audit process so that the response information returned by the CS does not leak information about user's data. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that DBPA is secure and efficient.","[Miao, Ying; Huang, Qiong; Xiao, Meiyan; Li, Hongbo] South China Agr Univ, Coll Math & Informat, Guangzhou 510642, Peoples R China; [Huang, Qiong] Guangzhou Key Lab Intelligent Agr, Guangzhou 510642, Peoples R China","South China Agricultural University","Huang, Q (corresponding author), South China Agr Univ, Coll Math & Informat, Guangzhou 510642, Peoples R China.;Huang, Q (corresponding author), Guangzhou Key Lab Intelligent Agr, Guangzhou 510642, Peoples R China.","qhuang@scau.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61872152]; Major Program of Guangdong Basic and Applied Research [2019B030302008]; Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou [201902010081]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Program of Guangdong Basic and Applied Research; Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61872152, in part by the Major Program of Guangdong Basic and Applied Research under Grant 2019B030302008, and in part by the Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou under Grant 201902010081.","","50","8","8","7","38","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","139813","139826","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3013153","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3013153","","","14","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","MW0EU","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000556721200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The first time students watched a video that contextualizes this stressful situation, they thought that they had been attacked by a computer virus. Fortunately, the panic only lasted a few seconds. This is the way to start a game called breakout or escape room. The difference between these two words is that, in the first case, the goal is to open a padlocked box, while the objective of an escape room is to find the key that allows to get out of a room. Both games are similar, containing riddles, puzzles, problems and some clues that would help the players to find the solution. This study analyses the use of a breakout game for educational purposes, more specifically in a university context.

Despite the great variety of cryptographic applications blind signatures also found their way in real-world scenarios. Due to the expected progress in cryptanalysis using quantum computers, it remains an important research question to find practical and secure alternatives to current systems based on the hardness of classical security assumptions such as factoring and computing discrete logarithms. In this work we present BLAZE: a new practical blind signature scheme from lattice assumptions. With respect to all relevant efficiency metrics BLAZE is more efficient than all previous blind signature schemes based on assumptions conjectured to withstand quantum computer attacks. For instance, at approximately 128 bits of security signatures are as small as 6.6KB, which represents an improvement factor of 2.7 compared to all previous candidates, and an expansion factor of 2.5 compared to the NIST PQC submission Dilithium. Our software implementation demonstrates the efficiency of BLAZE to be deployed in practical applications. In particular, generating a blind signature takes just 18 ms. The running time of both key generation and verification is in the same order as state-of-the-art ordinary signature schemes.","[Alkadri, Nabil Alkeilani; Buchmann, Johannes] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany; [El Bansarkhani, Rachid] QuantiCor Secur GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany","Technical University of Darmstadt","Alkadri, NA (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany.","nabil.alkadri@tu-darmstadt.de; rachid.elbansarkhani@quanticor-security.de; buchmann@cdc.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de","","","German Research Foundation (DFG) [CRC 1119]","German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","The authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers of FC20 for their comments and suggestions.

In the era of 5G, it is expected that the amount of mobile data will surpass that of wired data. To unlock the full potential of 5G, it is imperative to address the shortcomings of LTE, particularly the security weakness in handover. In LTE, the key derivation scheme used in handover does not support full forward key separation, which makes the network not only vulnerable to attacks but also prone to latency. Therefore, a novel approach is introduced using blockchain to overcome the issues. Blockchain is a technology originally developed to support Bitcoin to securely make financial transactions without an intermediary like a bank. Some of the innate security features of blockchain are evolved to support a structurally secure key derivation scheme for handover in 5G with full forward key separation. The paper reviews extensively on the security benefits of the new key derivation scheme using blockchain and demonstrates the simulation results using a custom application written in JavaScript to verify the performance enhancement.

However, it is very expensive in terms of energy consumption. For this reason, many other protocols have been designed in order to earmark part of the computations for useful tasks, or to reduce them, but few of these have the same properties of PoW. With this paper we propose a new consensus protocol for blockchains, called Proof of Evolution (PoE), that keeps the security features of PoW, and uses part of the mining computations for the execution of genetic algorithms (GAs) that some clients can submit. Moreover, PoE enables a form of cooperation among miners. During the mining process, in fact, miners have to maintain and evolve a population of solution candidates; PoE offers them the possibility of sharing their current best found solutions, that they can add to their population. This exchange seems to enhance the quality of the solutions they can achieve with the GAs in use. PoE is close to Proof of Search (PoS), which in turn extends PoW in order to solve optimization problems while mining. While PoS stimulates miners in submitting solutions for a problem of interest, the contribution of PoE is to encourage them to share their current best found solutions, allowing cooperation.","[Bizzaro, Francesco] Univ Padua, Padua, Italy; [Conti, Mauro] Univ Padua, Dept Math, Padua, Italy; [Pini, Maria Silvia] Univ Padua, Dept Informat Engn, Padua, Italy","University of Padua; University of Padua; University of Padua","Bizzaro, F (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Padua, Italy.","","Conti, Mauro/F-9145-2012","Conti, Mauro/0000-0002-3612-1934","","","","","10","4","4","1","2","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-0-7381-0495-9","","","","2020","","","","","","","450","455","","10.1109/Blockchain50366.2020.00065","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Blockchain50366.2020.00065","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR3LS","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000647642100056","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Its decision process involves continuous derivation of valuable information from various data sources and sequential decision optimization, which is a prospective research direction for reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we propose SARL, a novel State-Augmented RI. framework for PM. Our framework aims to address two unique challenges in financial PM: (1) data heterogeneity - the collected information for each asset is usually diverse. noisy and imbalanced (e.g., news articles); and (2) environment uncertainty - the financial market is versatile and non-stationary. To incorporate heterogeneous data and enhance robustness against environment uncertainty, our SARL augments the asset information with their price movement prediction as additional states, where the prediction can be solely based on financial data (e.g., asset prices) or derived from alternative sources such as news. Experiments on two real-world datasets, (i) Bitcoin market and (ii) HighTech stock market with 7-year Reuters news articles, validate the effectiveness of SARL over existing PM approaches, both in terms of accumulated profits and risk-adjusted profits. Moreover, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the importance of our proposed state augmentation, providing new insights and boosting performance significantly over standard RL-based PM method and other baselines.","[Ye, Yunan; Xiao, Jun] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Pei, Hengzhi] Fudan Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Boxin; Li, Bo] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL USA; [Chen, Pin-Yu; Zhu, Yada] IBM Res, Armonk, NY USA","Zhejiang University; Fudan University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; International Business Machines (IBM)","Ye, YN (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.","chryleo@zju.edu.cn; hzpei16@fudan.edu.cn; boxinw2@illinois.edu; pin-yu.chen@ibm.com; yzhu@us.ibm.com; junx@zju.edu.cn; lbo@illinois.edu","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018AAA0101900]; Zhejiang Natural Science Foundation [LR19F020002, LZ17F020001]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61976185, U19B200023, 61572431]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; IBM-ILLINOIS Center for Cognitive Computing Systems Research (C3SR) -a research collaboration as part of the IBM AI Horizons Network; National Science Foundation [CCF-1910100]; DARPA [ASED00009970]; Chinese Knowledge Center for Engineering Sciences and Technology","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Zhejiang Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); IBM-ILLINOIS Center for Cognitive Computing Systems Research (C3SR) -a research collaboration as part of the IBM AI Horizons Network(International Business Machines (IBM)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); DARPA(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)); Chinese Knowledge Center for Engineering Sciences and Technology","This work was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018AAA0101900), Zhejiang Natural Science Foundation (LR19F020002, LZ17F020001), National Natural Science Foundation of China(61976185, U19B200023, 61572431), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and Chinese Knowledge Center for Engineering Sciences and Technology, and IBM-ILLINOIS Center for Cognitive Computing Systems Research (C3SR) -a research collaboration as part of the IBM AI Horizons Network, National Science Foundation award CCF-1910100 and DARPA award ASED00009970.","","27","14","14","1","3","ASSOC ADVANCEMENT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE","PALO ALTO","2275 E BAYSHORE RD, STE 160, PALO ALTO, CA 94303 USA","2159-5399","2374-3468","978-1-57735-835-0","AAAI CONF ARTIF INTE","","","2020","34","","","","","","1112","1119","","","","","","8","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Education, Scientific Disciplines","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Education & Educational Research","BR7FR","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000667722801023","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The decentralization feature of blockchain makes the transaction information public in the cryptocurrency. It is possible to expose the user's privacy. Therefore, it is necessary to design an efficient and secure scheme to hide transaction information and guarantee that the transaction is carried out normally. In this paper, we propose a quasi-homomorphic symmetric encryption (QHSE) scheme to conceal the transaction amounts in cryptocurrency based on blockchain. For each transaction, transaction participants employ Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol to generate the specific transaction key as the symmetric key of QHSE. That is, each transaction has a distinct transaction key. Even if the transaction key of one transaction is leaked, other transactions will not reveal any private information, which guarantees the atomicity and stability of the transactions. To achieve the interoperability of different symmetric key, we design a KeyUp algorithm which enables the calculations between different ciphertexts. Combined with KeyUp, we also construct several operation algorithms (Multiplication, Addition, Comparison), so that transactions can be performed and verified normally in the ciphertext state. We prove that the proposed QHSE will not leak any private information to unauthorized parties, and demonstrate the utility and efficiency of QHSE from theoretical and experimental aspects.

A robust, scalable, and cost-optimal mechanism that can support the increasing number of transactions in a V2G network is required. Existing studies use traditional blockchain as to achieve this requirement. Blockchain-enabled V2G networks require a high computation power and are not suitable for micro-transactions due to the mining reward being higher than the transaction value itself. Moreover, the transaction throughput in the generic blockchain is too low to support the increasing number of frequent transactions in V2G networks. To address these challenges, in this paper, a lightweight blockchain-based protocol called Directed Acyclic Graph-based V2G network (DV2G) is proposed. Here blockchain refers to any Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and not just the bitcoin chain of blocks. A tangle data structure is used to record the transactions in the network in a secure and scalable manner. A game theory model is used to perform negotiation between the grid and vehicles at an optimized cost. The proposed model does not require the heavy computation associated to the addition of the transactions to the data structure and does not require any fees to post the transaction. The proposed model is shown to be highly scalable and supports the micro-transactions required in V2G networks.","[Hassija, Vikas; Krishna, Dara Nanda Gopala] Jaypee Inst Informat Technol, Dept CSE & IT, Noida 201304, India; [Chamola, Vinay] Birla Inst Technol & Sci Pilani, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Pilani Campus, Pilani 333031, Rajasthan, India; [Garg, Sahil; Kaddoum, Georges] Univ Quebec, Ecole Technol Super, Elect Engn Dept, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Jayakody, Dushantha Nalin K.] Natl Res Tomsk Polytech Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Robot, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Jayakody, Dushantha Nalin K.] Sri Lanka Technol Campus, Fac Engn, Ctr Telecommun Res, Padukka 10500, Sri Lanka","Jaypee Institute of Information Technology (JIIT); Birla Institute of Technology & Science Pilani (BITS Pilani); University of Quebec; Ecole de Technologie Superieure - Canada; University of Quebec Montreal; Tomsk Polytechnic University","Garg, S (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Ecole Technol Super, Elect Engn Dept, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.","vikas.hassija@jiit.ac.in; vinay.chamola@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in; sahil.garg@ieee.org; nandudara3105@gmail.com; georges.kaddoum@etsmtl.ca; nalin.jayakody@ieee.org","Hassija, Vikas/AAY-3020-2021; Garg, Sahil/AAN-2480-2020","JAYAKODY, Dushantha Nalin K./0000-0002-7004-2930; Dara, Nanda Gopala Krishna/0000-0001-9309-666X; Chamola, Vinay/0000-0002-6730-3060; Garg, Sahil/0000-0003-0229-608X","Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC), Ministry of Human Resource Development, India [P14]; National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University, Russia; International Cooperation Project of Sri Lanka Technological Campus, Sri Lanka; Tomsk Polytechnic University [RRSG/19/5008]","Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC), Ministry of Human Resource Development, India; National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University, Russia; International Cooperation Project of Sri Lanka Technological Campus, Sri Lanka; Tomsk Polytechnic University","This work was supported in part by the Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC), Ministry of Human Resource Development, India under the No. P14, in part by the framework of Competitiveness Enhancement Program of the National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University, Russia, and in part by the International Cooperation Project of Sri Lanka Technological Campus, Sri Lanka and Tomsk Polytechnic University under Grant RRSG/19/5008.","","47","78","78","33","95","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","0018-9545","1939-9359","","IEEE T VEH TECHNOL","IEEE Trans.

Widely-used applications of blockchain include digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This paper proposes an algorithmic approach to analyze the efficiency of a blockchain as a function of the number of blocks and the average synchronization delay. The proposed algorithms consider a random network model that characterizes the growth of a tree of blocks by adhering to a standard protocol. The model is parametric on two probability distribution functions governing block production and communication delay. Both distributions determine the synchronization efficiency of the distributed copies of the blockchain among the socalled workers and, therefore, are key for capturing the overall stochastic growth. Moreover, the algorithms consider scenarios with a fixed or an unbounded number of workers in the network. The main result illustrates how the algorithms can be used to evaluate different types of blockchain designs, e.g., systems in which the average time of block production can match the average time of message broadcasting required for synchronization. In particular, this algorithmic approach provides insight into efficiency criteria for identifying conditions under which increasing block production has a negative impact on the stability of a blockchain. The model and algorithms are agnostic of the blockchain's final use, and they serve as a formal framework for specifying and analyzing a variety of non-functional properties of current and future blockchains.","[Pinzon, Carlos; Rocha, Camilo; Finke, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Cali, Colombia","Pontificia Universidad Javeriana","Pinzon, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Cali, Colombia.","","","Rocha, Camilo/0000-0003-4356-7704","Center of Excellence and Appropriation in Big Data and Data Analytics (CAOBA); Colombian Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (COLCIENCIAS) [FP44842-anex46-2015]","Center of Excellence and Appropriation in Big Data and Data Analytics (CAOBA); Colombian Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (COLCIENCIAS)(Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias)","This research was supported by the Center of Excellence and Appropriation in Big Data and Data Analytics (CAOBA), founded by the Ministry of Information Technologies and Telecommunications of Colombia (MinTIC) and the Colombian Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (COLCIENCIAS) under grant no.

This paper intends to estimate the usability of blockchain technology by investigating behavioral elements that affect customers' intention towards blockchain-based cryptocurrency transactions. Given the complexity of the technology, this study proposes a new integration model: The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) together with new external variables regarding blockchain adoption characteristics such as trust, regulatory support, social influence, design, and experience. Surveys were conducted among international users to identify the impacts of these variables on their intention. Our findings indicate two powerful constructs (regulatory support and experience) that encourage customer trust towards blockchain-based applications. People surveyed agreed on a great sense of security and can trust the Blockchain-based applications when they are regulated and insured by the local government. Also, at a certain level of experience, users feel confident to use blockchain-based applications, a high level of trust supports technology adoption. As such, governments and businesses can dedicate efforts to enhance customers' trust and ultimately promote better acceptance of blockchain technology and its applications.","[Albayati, Hayder] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol KAIST, Global IT Technol Program ITTP, 291 Daehak Ro, Daejeon, South Korea; [Kim, Suk Kyoung; Rho, Jae Jeung] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol KAIST, Sch Business & Technol Management, 291 Daehak Ro, Daejeon, South Korea","Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST)","Albayati, H (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol KAIST, Global IT Technol Program ITTP, 291 Daehak Ro, Daejeon, South Korea.","hayder1111@gmail.com","Al-Bayati, Hayder/AAH-7165-2021","Al-Bayati, Hayder/0000-0002-5295-7918","","","","","97","55","56","13","92","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0160-791X","1879-3274","","TECHNOL SOC","Technol.

This is a valuable process that other industries could leverage. One such industry that could benefit from applying blockchain technology for a multitude of cases is the healthcare industry. Primary care doctors could be connected to a blockchain system that allowed them to access patient data and securely monitor the respective patient, pharmaceutical companies could increase their products validity in the marketplace with individual product tracking, and the insurance industry could trust all the information about a client. All of these are possible use cases for blockchain in the healthcare industry. Currently, the healthcare industry is not leveraging the blockchain at scale.

Experience with the consensus mechanisms employed in popular blockchain platforms have warranted years of research into more scalable and energy-efficient consensus mechanisms for a green society using constrained devices. Most of the high-security consensus mechanisms require the use of computational resources which are simply not available to devices with a constrained nature. Hence, the presence and activity of these devices do not contribute to the security of the ledger, irrespective of how numerous they are on the network. In this paper, we propose a novel consensus scheme, fully dependent on WiFi technology, suitable for constrained devices. Whilst in traditional Blockchain consensus mechanisms, constrained devices do not add to the security of the ledger, the security of our consensus mechanism increases with the number of connected devices.","[Ngubo, Chinazaekpere E.; Dohler, Mischa] Kings Coll London, Dept Engn, Ctr Telecommun Res, London WC2R 2LS, England","University of London; King's College London","Ngubo, CE (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Dept Engn, Ctr Telecommun Res, London WC2R 2LS, England.","chinazaekpere.ngubo@kcl.ac.uk","Ngubo, Chinazaekpere/AAJ-7869-2021","Ngubo, Chinazaekpere/0000-0002-2097-8036; Dohler, Mischa/0000-0001-9583-2923","","","","","13","5","5","3","11","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","143595","143606","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3014287","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3014287","","","12","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","NB2RG","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000560359500001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This suggests that selection of a specific hash function may not be a trivial decision for designing a blockchain.","[Wang, Fuqin; Chen, Yijiang; Wang, Ruochen; Francis, Akindipe Olusegun; Emmanuel, Bugingo; Zheng, Wei] Xiamen Univ, Sch Informat, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jinjun] Swinburne Univ Technol, Swinburne Data Sci Res Inst, Melbourne, Vic 3122, Australia","Xiamen University; Swinburne University of Technology","Zheng, W (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Sch Informat, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.","wangfq@stu.xmu.edu.cn; cyj@xmu.edu.cn; wrcxmu@stu.xmu.edu.cn; akindipeolusegun@stu.xmu.edu.cn; emmanuelbugingo@stu.xmu.edu.cn; zhengw@xmu.edu.cn; jinjun.chen@gmail.com","","BUGINGO, EMMANUEL/0000-0001-5176-6821","National Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China [2018J01107]; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC [61671397, 61672439]","National Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China under Grant 2018J01107, and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, under Grant 61671397 and Grant 61672439.","","65","10","10","3","19","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","0018-9391","1558-0040","","IEEE T ENG MANAGE","IEEE Trans.

In this study, bitcoin yield rate is taken as the research object, and data from June 2, 2016 to December 30, 2018 are collected, totaling 943 pieces. The BP neural network, support vector regression machine algorithm and particle swarm optimization least square vector algorithm are respectively adopted to carry out model simulation and empirical analysis on the collected data, and it is concluded that particle swarm optimization least square vector algorithm has the best fitting effect. Subsequently, the Ethereum (ETH) yield rate is selected as the research object, and the model simulation and empirical analysis are carried out on it, which verifies that the optimized algorithm has better prediction and fitting on the time series. The results show that the particle swarm optimization algorithm among the three algorithms mentioned in this research has the best prediction effect. Therefore, the results of this study have a good fitting effect on the prediction of the yield rate of blockchain financial products, have a good guiding effect on the investors of blockchain financial products, and have a good guiding significance for the study of the yield rate of China's blockchain financial products.

In special, cryptocurrency is one of the main applications of the blockchain technology. Despite the recent interest in blockchain, we still lack in-depth analysis of systems that use such a technology. In fact, most of the existing works focus on Bitcoin. Moreover, blockchain-based cryptocurrency systems are highly dynamic. Their internal mechanisms and consensus algorithms evolve over time. Users also change their interests in a given platform, which in turn, reflect their behaviour. In this article, we model the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency transaction network, a more recent blockchain platform that is gaining a significant share in the cryptocurrency market. We model the transactions of Ethereum as a complex system, representing this complex system as a time-varying graph. Our model and the analysis we conduct rely on a 3-year dataset of Ethereum-based cryptocurrency transactions, comprising more than 38 million users (i.e. unique wallet addresses) and almost 300 million transactions. We analyse the evolution of users and transactions over time. Our study also highlights the centralization tendency of the transaction network on both user and time aspects. Finally, we also analyse the formation of communities and the evolution of connected components considering the dynamics of the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency transaction network.","[Gaviao Mascarenhas, Juliana Zanelatto; Ziviani, Artur; Wehmuth, Klaus] Natl Lab Sci Comp LNCC, Dept Computat & Math Methods, Petropolis, RJ, Brazil; [Vieira, Alex Borges] Univ Fed Juiz de Fora UFJF, Comp Sci Dept, Juiz De Fora, Brazil","Laboratorio Nacional de Computacao Cientifica (LNCC); Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora","Vieira, AB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Juiz de Fora UFJF, Comp Sci Dept, Juiz De Fora, Brazil.","alex.borges@ufjf.edu.br","","","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2015/24493-1]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) [E-26/203.046/2017]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) [310.201/2019-5, 465.560/2014-8, 159709/2018-0]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [3038.008418/2019-51]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG))","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) -2015/24493-1 Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) - E-26/203.046/2017 Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) - 310.201/2019-5, 465.560/2014-8, 159709/2018-0 Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) -3038.008418/2019-51 Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG).","","25","1","1","3","11","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","2051-1310","2051-1329","","J COMPLEX NETW","J.

After more than a decade of development, blockchain has been widely used in medical, digital finance, and electronic evidence, etc. Consensus algorithm is the core part of blockchain and has become the bottleneck of blockchain performance. At present, there are dozens of different consensus algorithms for different application context, such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Delegate Proof of Stake (DPoS), Proof of Reputation (PoR), etc. But in Public blockchains, their performance, security and stability are difficult to support a large project. This paper introduces an improved consensus algorithm named Delegated Proof of Stake with node's behavior and Borda Count (DPoSB) which based on the node behavior monitoring in DPoS and Borda count voting. The node's behavior of generating blocks is used as a reference index for node elections, and it will increase the difficulty for nodes that have bad behavior. Then, combined with the Borda Count to elect nodes that is more in line with the other nodes' wishes. So, the elected nodes are more secure and fairer, thereby ensuring the stability of the system and the interests of blockchain nodes. Finally, the feasibility and correctness of the consensus algorithm is proved by simulation experiments of the blockchain system.","[Tan, Chao; Xiong, Liang] Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Tan, Chao; Xiong, Liang] Mobile Internet Data Applicat Engn Technol Res Ct, Chongqing, Peoples R China","Chongqing University of Posts & Telecommunications","Tan, C (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Chongqing, Peoples R China.;Tan, C (corresponding author), Mobile Internet Data Applicat Engn Technol Res Ct, Chongqing, Peoples R China.","1373919758@qq.com; 553611543@qq.com","","","","","","","8","2","2","0","6","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-7281-4323-1; 978-1-7281-4322-4","","","","2020","","","","","","","1429","1434","","","","","","6","Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Engineering, Mechanical","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Automation & Control Systems; Engineering","BQ7NE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000617764100281","View Full Record in Web of Science"

One characteristic feature of our approach is that we aim at a holistic view that would integrate all available information: First, financial information, including market capitalization and historical daily prices. Second, features related to the underlying blockchain from blockchain explorers like network activity: blockchains handle the supply and demand of a cryptocurrency. Lastly, we integrate software development metrics based on GitHub activity by the supporting team. We set two goals: First, to classify a given cryptocurrency by its performance, where stability and price increase are the positive features. Second, to forecast daily price tendency through regression; this is of course a well-studied problem. A related third goal is to determine the most relevant features for such analysis. We compare various neural networks using most of the widely traded digital currencies (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin) in both classification and regression settings. Simple Feedforward neural networks are considered, as well as Recurrent neural networks (RNN) along with their improvements, namely Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units.

In the early 1990's the so called Fuzzy Time Series were proposed to handle vague and imprecise knowledge in time series data and have since become competitive forecasting models. A common limitation of recent fuzzy time series models is their inability to handle non-stationary data. Thus, in this paper we introduce a Non-Stationary Fuzzy Time Series (NSFTS). In the proposed method, we employ Non-Stationary Fuzzy Sets, in which perturbation functions are used to adapt the membership function parameters in the knowledge base in response to statistical changes in the time series. The flexibility of the method by means of computational experiments was tested with eight synthetic non-stationary time series data with several kinds of concept drifts, four real market indices (Dow Jones, NASDAQ SP500 and TAIEX), three real FOREX pairs (EUR-USD, EUR-GBP, GBP-USD), and two real cryptocoins exchange rates (Bitcoin-USD and Ethereum-USD). As competitor models the Time Variant fuzzy time series and the Incremental Ensemble were used, these are two of the major approaches for handling non-stationary data sets. The proposed method shows resilience to concept drift, by adapting parameters of the model, while preserving the symbolic structure of the knowledge base. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Continuous efforts have been made to strengthen the processes and methods involved to achieve verifiable, transparent voting systems. In recent years, blockchain has been increasingly used to address multi-dimensional challenges across widespread application domains including healthcare, finance and e-voting. However, achieving an efficient solution via use of blockchain requires consideration of a range of factors such as block generation rate, transaction speed, and block size which have a profound role in determining the overall performance of the solution. Current research into this aspect of blockchain is focused on Bitcoin with the objective to achieve comparable performance as of existing online payment systems such as VISA. However, there exists a gap in literature with respect to investigating performance constraints for wider application domains. In this paper, we present our efforts to address this gap by presenting a detailed study into performance and scalability constraints for an e-voting system. Specifically, we conducted rigorous experimentation with permissioned and permissionless blockchain settings across different scenarios with respect to voting population, block size, block generation rate and transaction speed. The experiments highlighted interesting observations with respect to the impact of these parameters on the overall efficiency and scalability of the e-voting model including trade-offs between different parameters as well as security and performance.

However, the ability to successfully conduct payments in such networks relies on the willingness of participants to lock collateral in the network. In Lightning, the key financial incentive to lock collateral are low fees for routing payments of other participants. While users can choose these fees, real-world data indicates that they mainly stick to default fees. By providing insights on beneficial choices for fees, we aim to incentivize users to lock more collateral and improve the effectiveness of the network. In this paper, we consider a node A that given the network topology and the channel details establishes channels and chooses fees to maximize its financial gain. Our contributions are i) formalization of the optimization problem, ii) proving that the problem is NP-hard, and iii) designing and evaluating a greedy algorithm to approximate the optimal solution.

However, traditional block-based blockchain techniques, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are not suitable for IoT transactions due to its low throughput, high computation overhead, and costly transaction fee. To satisfy the requirements of IoT, DAG-based approaches, aiming to provide cheap blockchain services with low latency and high throughput, are emerging. In this paper, we present a set of comprehensive experimental studies on IOTA, a representative DAG-based blockchain, and aim to exhibit its unique characteristics mainly from two aspects: performance and security. We have developed a series of benchmark tools and judiciously selected typical configurations to perform experimental examinations with a real private IOTA network. Our studies reveal several interesting findings: 1) The throughput of IOTA is higher than the traditional block-based blockchain, but far less than the reported thousands TPS in its whitepaper, even with scaling-up configurations; 2) The database query heavily impacts the performance of IOTA, even more than its PoW (Proof of Work) process. We make our benchmark tools in public and expect our works can inspire system architects, application designers, and practitioners with new optimization directions and potential application cases for further exploration.","[Wang, Tianyu; Shao, Zili] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qian; Shen, Zhaoyan; Jia, Zhiping] Shandong Univ, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China","Chinese University of Hong Kong; Shandong University","Shao, ZL (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","tywang@cse.cuhk.edu.hk; daisy_seven@163.com; shenzhaoyan@sdu.edu.cn; jzp@sdu.edu.cn; shao@cse.cuhk.edu.hk","","Wang, Tianyu/0000-0001-7030-1990","Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China [GRF 15206617, GRF 15224918]; Chinese University of Hong Kong [4055096]; National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China [61902218]; Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University [2019HW032]","Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Chinese University of Hong Kong(Chinese University of Hong Kong); National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China; Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University","The work described in this paper is partially supported by the grants from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (GRF 15206617, GRF 15224918), Direct Grant for Research, The Chinese UnivYersity of Hong Kong (Project No. 4055096), the National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China (Grant No. 61902218), and the Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University (No. 2019HW032).","","16","1","1","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2576-3504","2576-3512","978-1-7281-6466-3","IEEE I C EMBED SOFTW","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BQ6NJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000612701600010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Since Nakamoto's Bitcoin cryptocurrency system, an enormous number of decentralised applications have been proposed on top of these technologies, aiming at more transparency and trustworthiness than their traditional counterparts. Unfortunately, Blockchain introduces very subtle implications for other desirable properties such as privacy. In this work, we demonstrate these subtle implications for Blockchain-based searchable encryption solutions, which are one specific use case of cloud computing services. These solutions build on top of Blockchain and attempt to achieve both the standard privacy property and the new fairness property, which requires that search operations are carried out faithfully and are rewarded accordingly. We show that directly replacing the server in an existing searchable encryption solution with a Blockchain will cause undesirable operational cost, privacy loss, and security vulnerabilities. The analysis results indicate that a dedicated server is still needed to achieve the desired privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose two frameworks which can be instantiated based on most existing searchable encryption schemes. Through analysing these two frameworks, we affirmatively show that a carefully engineered Blockchain-enabled solution can achieve the desired fairness property while preserving the privacy guarantee of the original searchable encryption scheme simultaneously.","[Tang, Qiang] Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol, 5 Ave Hauts Fourneaux, L-4362 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg","Luxembourg Institute of Science & Technology","Tang, Q (corresponding author), Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol, 5 Ave Hauts Fourneaux, L-4362 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.","qiang.tang@list.lu","","","","","","","20","6","6","3","9","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-41579-2; 978-3-030-41578-5","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2020","11999","","","","","","482","500","","10.1007/978-3-030-41579-2_28","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-41579-2_28","","","19","Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BR7MJ","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000668350000028","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, due to security and privacy issues, sharing data between healthcare organisations is challenging. This has led to data shortage in the healthcare sector which is considered as a significant issue not only in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) but also worldwide. The primary objective of conducting this paper is to investigate the various factors that enable secure sharing and exchange of healthcare information between different healthcare providers in the KSA. It starts by discussing the current literature and frameworks for managing healthcare data information and the challenges that health providers encounter, particularly when it comes to issues such as data security, patient privacy, and healthcare information exchange. These challenges in managing healthcare data have necessitated the need for implementing a solution that can allow medical providers to have access to updated healthcare information. Attention in the healthcare sector has been drawn to blockchain technology as a part of the solution, especially after the technology was successfully applied in the financial sector to improve the security of financial transactions, particularly involving digital currencies such as Bitcoin. Therefore, a framework based on the blockchain technology has been proposed to achieve the goals of the present research.","[Alzahrani, Ahmed G.; Alenezi, Ahmed; Atlam, Hany F.; Wills, Gary] Univ Southampton, Elect & Comp Sci Dept, Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Alzahrani, Ahmed G.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Alenezi, Ahmed] Northern Border Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Ar Ar, Saudi Arabia","University of Southampton; King Abdulaziz University; Northern Borders University","Alzahrani, AG (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Elect & Comp Sci Dept, Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.;Alzahrani, AG (corresponding author), King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.","","Atlam, Hany/S-8160-2018","Atlam, Hany/0000-0003-4142-6377; Wills, Gary/0000-0001-5771-4088","","","","","67","4","4","0","2","SCITEPRESS","SETUBAL","AV D MANUELL, 27A 2 ESQ, SETUBAL, 2910-595, PORTUGAL","","","978-989-758-426-8","","","","2020","","","","","","","349","358","","10.5220/0009413403490358","http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0009413403490358","","","10","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BQ7HB","","hybrid, Green Accepted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000615960700038","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We utilize a novel method which can reveal guard relays for multiple hidden services. The method helps us to reveal guard relays for 13604 hidden services, and observe their binding relations for 7 months. Based on the binding relations, we conduct the first protocol-level measurement and family analysis of hidden services, and discover two types of families about hidden services, named onion family and onion-node family. Our measurement reveals 263 onion families in Tor network, and the analysis shows that onion addresses in these families tend to use common prefixes or meaningful prefixes. By analyzing the webpage of these hidden services, we surprisingly find a super onion family that contains 121 hidden services, most of which runs a fraudulent website of bitcoin.

Yet, conflating all of these institutions and their roles as a singular target of disruption is a mistake as the motivations and mechanisms of each type of institution varies. This project proposes a call for research on blockchain technology, and smart contracts in particular, as they relate to two types of oversight practices. The first study considers how legal discourse provides (or fails to provide) the proper oversight for digitized contracts and how smart contracts, rather than replace it, might only serve to exacerbate some of its failures. The second study looks at the investigation and prosecution of criminal activity and the creation of standards and regulations by corresponding institutions that force companies to produce records that stand as evidence in these investigations. The analysis draws on previous interpretations of digitized contracts and a series of interviews with two IRS Special Agents who investigate blockchain or related crime.","[Cornelius, Kristin B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Informat Studies, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","University of California System; University of California Los Angeles","Cornelius, KB (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Informat Studies, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","krisbcorn@ucla.edu","","","","","","","47","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES","","","978-94-024-1555-1; 978-94-024-1553-7","","","","2020","","","","","","","627","646","","10.1007/978-94-024-1555-1_28","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-024-1555-1_28","10.1007/978-94-024-1555-1","","20","Communication; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)","Communication; Computer Science","BT8JX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000853761500036","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Distributed ledger system which is the main feature of blockchain technology protected across harmful updates using cryptographic techniques, e.g. hashing and digital signatures, is spread over the network so that no one is the owner of the ledger. This poses a significant challenge in the areas of performance, security, and privacy using this emerging technology. We propose an algorithm to provide a secure mechanism for performing transactions on the Blockchain network by adopting quantum digital signatures (QDS) and quantum teleportation phenomenon of quantum computing. The proposed algorithm uses key pairs to generate private keys and corresponding public keys; the quantum digital signatures are used to sign the message which are then distributed over the blockchain network using the teleportation phenomenon. The security of the keys is dependent on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics that doesn't allow forging. The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair of particles is used to communicate the quantum information via a quantum channel for teleportation, which is generated by operating Bell measurements with corresponding EPR pairs. The original state of the particle (sender) is destroyed once the information is transported to the other particle (receiver) and the QDS scheme also validates the qubits received. The twofold validation process thereby provides high-level security in the transactions.","[Singh, Sheetal; Rajput, Nikhil Kumar; Rathi, Vipin Kumar] Univ Delhi, Ramanujan Coll, Dept Comp Sci, New Delhi 110019, India; [Pandey, Hari Mohan] Edge Hill Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ormskirk, England; [Jaiswal, Amit Kumar] Univ Bedfordshire, Inst Res Applicable Comp, Bedford, Lancs, England; [Tiwari, Prayag] Univ Padua, Dept Informat Engn, Padua, Italy","University of Delhi; Edge Hill University; University of Bedfordshire; University of Padua","Rajput, NK; Rathi, VK (corresponding author), Univ Delhi, Ramanujan Coll, Dept Comp Sci, New Delhi 110019, India.;Tiwari, P (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Informat Engn, Padua, Italy.","sheetal.singh@ramanujan.du.ac.in; nikhil45_scs@jnu.ac.in; vipin68_scs@jnu.ac.in; pandeyh@edgehill.ac.uk; amitkumar.jaiswal@beds.ac.uk; prayag.tiwari@dei.unipd.it","Pandey, Hari Mohan/M-9658-2015; Rajput, Nikhil Kumar/T-4601-2017; Tiwari, Prayag/N-6261-2017; Jaiswal, Amit Kumar/AAV-8539-2020","Pandey, Hari Mohan/0000-0002-9128-068X; Tiwari, Prayag/0000-0002-2851-4260; Jaiswal, Amit Kumar/0000-0001-8848-7041; Rajput, Nikhil Kumar/0000-0002-7268-0207","","","","","19","5","5","1","25","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1370-4621","1573-773X","","NEURAL PROCESS LETT","Neural Process.

In this survey, we present a comprehensive review and analysis on the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus protocols. To facilitate the discussion of our analysis, we first introduce the key definitions and relevant results in the classic theory of fault tolerance which help to lay the foundation for further discussion. We identify five core components of a blockchain consensus protocol, namely, block proposal, block validation, information propagation, block finalization, and incentive mechanism. A wide spectrum of blockchain consensus protocols are then carefully reviewed accompanied by algorithmic abstractions and vulnerability analyses. The surveyed consensus protocols are analyzed using the five-component framework and compared with respect to different performance metrics. These analyses and comparisons provide us new insights in the fundamental differences of various proposals in terms of their suitable application scenarios, key assumptions, expected fault tolerance, scalability, drawbacks and trade-offs. We believe this survey will provide blockchain developers and researchers a comprehensive view on the state-of-the-art consensus protocols and facilitate the process of designing future protocols.","[Xiao, Yang; Hou, Y.

Recently, Intel software guard extensions (SGX), as new trusted computing technologies, have provided a new solution to the above challenges in the blockchain area. Although many studies have focused on using SGX technology to enhance their schemes in the blockchain areas, no comprehensive survey has systematically analyzed and delineated these studies. This article is the first to systematically discuss the application status of SGX in the blockchain area. In this article, we study the scheme designs, advantages, and disadvantages of the existing works using a six-layer hierarchical structure of the blockchain. We also summarize the functions of SGX and formally analyze the advantages and disadvantages of SGX.

The problem of storage is becoming one challenge of blockchain since the storage overhead of each node increase rapidly. Reducing the storage overhead of each participant is very urgent and worthy. In this paper, we present GCBlock: a grouping overlay network storage scheme for the blockchain which can reduce the storage overhead of nodes and cut the whole storage cost of the blockchain greatly while keeping the underlying protocols.

The protocol uses a one-time cryptographic signature scheme that is resistant against attacks by quantum computers. This one-time signature scheme results in a portion of an address's private key being revealed in the signature of each outgoing transaction from that address. If an address is used for multiple outgoing transfers, it is feasible for an adversary to forge a signature by using parts of the private key associated with the address that have been revealed. In this paper, we propose the use of the cuckoo filter in the IOTA core lightweight client in order to avoid address reuse. We validate our proposed approach by implementation and evaluation in the real IOTA architecture. The obtained performance results show that the cuckoo filter integration in the IOTA core lightweight client avoids address reuse and makes the process of new address generation much more efficient and secure. Additionally, our approach can be integrated directly into the current IOTA core lightweight client.","[Shafeeq, Sehrish; Alam, Masoom; Khan, Abid] COMSATS Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Cyber Secur Lab, Islamabad 45550, Pakistan; [Zeadally, Sherali] Univ Kentucky, Coll Commun & Informat, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI); University of Kentucky","Shafeeq, S (corresponding author), COMSATS Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Cyber Secur Lab, Islamabad 45550, Pakistan.","sehrixhshafeeq@gmail.com; szeadally@uky.edu; masoom.alam@comsats.edu.pk; abidkhan@comsats.edu.pk","","Khan, Abid/0000-0003-2712-1956; SHAFEEQ, SEHRISH/0000-0003-1925-349X","","","","","41","17","18","2","10","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","0018-9391","1558-0040","","IEEE T ENG MANAGE","IEEE Trans.

The characteristics of blockchain, such as traceable and tamper-proof, can solve the issue of data trust. However, the access threshold of the blockchain is high. In order to reduce the technical difficulty, in this article, a universal BaaS platform (called TrustedBaaS) which has high flexibility and scalability was designed based on consortium blockchain, it can support user-defined configuration according to requirements of users. Afterwards we described the process of executing a transaction in detail and discussed the core protocols and algorithms of the BaaS platform, which includes identity authentication, consensus algorithm, data protection protocol, smart contract and on-blockchain and off-blockchain data collaboration. Furthermore, we implemented TrustedBaaS based on Hyperledger Fabric and a vehicular information management application platform and a transaction settlement application platform were configured based on TrustedBaaS. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the TrustedBaaS and compared it with current public blockchain such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The evaluation showed that the designed TrustedBaaS has better performance than the existing public blockchain platforms. Moreover, it is common distributed higher-level trusted platform which provides configurable and extensible functions and solves the problem that the access threshold of blockchain technology is high.","[Ma, Zhaofeng; Zhao, Weizhe; Luo, Shoushan; Wang, Lingyun] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Cyberspace Secur, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China; [Ma, Zhaofeng; Zhao, Weizhe; Luo, Shoushan; Wang, Lingyun] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Informat Secur Ctr, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China","Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications","Ma, ZF (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Cyberspace Secur, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.;Ma, ZF (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Informat Secur Ctr, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.","mzf@but.edu.cn","Wang, Lingyun/GWR-0883-2022; WAN, JIE/AAK-1127-2021","Wang, Lingyun/0000-0001-9566-857X; ","","","","","32","7","7","4","22","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1389-1286","1872-7069","","COMPUT NETW","Comput.

Since then, blockchain has been rapidly developed. Blockchain is not only limited to the field of cryptocurrency but also has been extensively applied to the Internet of Things, supply chain finance, electronic evidence storage, data sharing, and e-government fields. Both the public chain and the alliance chain have been extensively developed. In the data processing field, blockchain has a particularly good application potential. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is a proposal consisting of a joint venture of more than ten countries, resulting in the world's largest synthetic aperture radio telescope. In the SKA, the processing scale of the data is large, and it consists of several data processing nodes. The data will be processed in the cloud computing mode. Taking the SKA under consideration, this report proposes a data processing scheme based on blockchain for the anti-counterfeiting, anti-tampering and traceability of data. Furthermore, the authenticity and integrity of the data are assured. The primary aspects include data distribution, data operation and data sharing, which correspond to the data reception, data algorithm processing and result sharing of data operation in the SKA. With this process, the integrity, reliability and authenticity of the data are guaranteed. Additionally, smart contracts, homomorphic hashing, secure containers, aggregate signatures and one-way encrypted channels are implemented to ensure the intelligence, security and high performance of the process.","[Fu, Jinhua; Xu, Mixue; Huang, Yongzhong; Si, Xueming; Yuan, Chao] State Key Lab Math Engn & Adv Comp, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Fu, Jinhua] Zhengzhou Univ Light Ind, Sch Comp & Commun Engn, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China; [Si, Xueming] Fudan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Huang, Yongzhong] Guilin Univ Elect Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Informat Secur, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China","PLA Information Engineering University; Zhengzhou University of Light Industry; Fudan University; Guilin University of Electronic Technology","Fu, JH (corresponding author), State Key Lab Math Engn & Adv Comp, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China.","jinhua@zzuli.edu.cn","","","Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [61521003]; Intergovernmental Special Programme of the National Key Research and Development Programme [2016YFE0100300, 2016YFE0100600]; National Scientific Fund Programme for Young Scholar [61672470]; Science and Technology Project of Henan Province [182102210617, 202102210351]","Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Intergovernmental Special Programme of the National Key Research and Development Programme; National Scientific Fund Programme for Young Scholar; Science and Technology Project of Henan Province","This research is supported by the Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61521003), Intergovernmental Special Programme of the National Key Research and Development Programme (2016YFE0100300, 2016YFE0100600), National Scientific Fund Programme for Young Scholar (61672470) and Science and Technology Project of Henan Province (182102210617, 202102210351).","","32","1","1","4","35","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1687-1472","1687-1499","","EURASIP J WIREL COMM","EURASIP J.

A critical requirement of such systems is to provide enough fault tolerance in the presence of adversarial attacks or network faults. This is essential to guarantee liveness when the network does not behave as expected and ensure that the underlying nodes agree on a unique order of transactions over a shared state. In comparison with traditional distributed systems, the deployment of a distributed-ledger system should take into account the hidden game theoretical aspects of such protocols, where actors are competing with each other in an environment which is likely to experience various well-motivated malicious and adversarial attacks. Firstly, this paper discusses the fundamental principles of existing consensus protocols in the context of both permissioned and permissionless distributed-ledger systems. The main contribution of this work deals with observations from experimenting with Ripple's consensus protocol as it is embodied in the XRP Ledger. The main experimental finding suggests that, when a low percentage of malicious nodes is present, the centralization degree of the network can be significantly relaxed ensuring low convergence times. Those findings are of particular importance when engineering a consensus algorithm that would like to balance security with decentralization.","[Christodoulou, Klitos; Iosif, Elias; Inglezakis, Antonios; Themistocleous, Marinos] Univ Nicosia, Inst Future, CY-2414 Engomi, Cyprus","University of Nicosia","Christodoulou, K (corresponding author), Univ Nicosia, Inst Future, CY-2414 Engomi, Cyprus.","christodoulou.kl@unic.ac.cy; iosif.e@unic.ac.cy; inglezakis.a@unic.ac.cy; themistocleous.m@unic.ac.cy","Themistocleous, Marinos/W-4770-2018; Christodoulou, Klitos/J-8249-2018","Themistocleous, Marinos/0000-0002-6904-9692; Christodoulou, Klitos/0000-0003-3543-6405; Inglezakis, Antonios/0000-0001-6404-8079","Ripple's Impact Fund, an advised fund of Silicon Valley Community Foundation [2018-188546]","Ripple's Impact Fund, an advised fund of Silicon Valley Community Foundation","This research was funded by the Ripple's Impact Fund, an advised fund of Silicon Valley Community Foundation (Grant id: 2018-188546).","","37","10","10","1","4","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1999-5903","","FUTURE INTERNET","Future Internet","MAR","2020","12","3","","","","","","","53","10.3390/fi12030053","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi12030053","","","12","Computer Science, Information Systems","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Computer Science","LB0OI","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000524337000007","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Although Blockchain has become known for its support of crypto-coins (or crypto currencies), especially Bitcoin, its scope has become much larger, including businesses of relevant social impact. This paper presents an application of the Ethereum's Blockchain digital architecture for the solid waste management in a small municipality in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. This application comes to replace a paperbased current system. The current system uses printed cards called Green Coins, presenting vulnerabilities that should be overcome with the implementation of the new system. The blockchain-based system provides financial management for the collection of waste in the municipality aiming at better health and socio-environmental education and the financial and social inclusion of volunteer citizens, through the use of social currency. The proposed application uses social crypto-coins and security support through Ethereum's Blockchain, instead of the printed cards currently being used, including volunteer citizens, store owners and public agents. It should contribute in a relevant way to improving the quality of life in the municipality in relation to the typical aspects of sustainability: education, health, environment, social inclusion and local economy, contributing to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The proposed application may eventually expand in to other municipalities, including major urban centers and private condominiums. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Franca, A. S.

Blockchain, the new technology underpinning decentralised and immutable databases, has seen much discussion as a potentially game-changing development. Although many industries are exploring its value, the technology has thus far made only minor impacts. A rapidly expanding base of research has emerged on blockchain & x2019;s role as a potential disruptor in the electrical energy industry. However, it may be difficult to distinguish hype from more imminently plausible impacts. This paper attempts to serve as a guide for engineering managers wishing to make sense of blockchain & x2019;s potential in electricity. This is accomplished by formulating a novel blockchain industry disruption framework, which exists across three tiers. These tiers extend from ideas with the least effect on an industry to total revolutionary concepts that could completely transform an industry. This taxonomy is constructed by examining existing research into disruption hierarchies and blockchain classification methods. Through the lens of this taxonomy, a literature review is performed on blockchain & x2019;s role in energy to draw out themes and ideas characterising each tier. The potential likelihood of real-world application of various ideas are discussed, considering how established industries may be affected or disrupted. The authors provide some conjecture here. Finally, courses of action are suggested for those whose sector may be affected by blockchain.","[De Villiers, Almero; Cuffe, Paul] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Dublin D04 V1W8 4, Ireland","University College Dublin","De Villiers, A (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Dublin D04 V1W8 4, Ireland.","almero.devilliers@ucdconnect.ie","","de Villiers, Almero/0000-0001-5225-6030; Cuffe, Paul/0000-0003-4544-9648","Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland through the SEAI Research, Development, and Demonstration Funding Program [18/RDD/373]","Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland through the SEAI Research, Development, and Demonstration Funding Program","This work was supported by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland through the SEAI Research, Development, and Demonstration Funding Program 2018, under Grant 18/RDD/373.","","85","9","9","3","13","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","65670","65682","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2983558","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2983558","","","13","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","LK4MU","","Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000530836000013","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In a standard European-wide real estate transaction, several intermediaries are involved. As a consequence, these agreements are usually time-consuming and involve extra difficulties to cross-border operations. As blockchain, combined with smart contracts, may have an important role in these transactions, this paper aims to explore its prospective challenges, limitations and opportunities in the real estate sector and discover how the traditional intermediaries have to face a possible implementation of this technology. Design/methodology/approach This paper analyses the current intermediaries in the real estate sector in European Union (EU), their functions and how can blockchain strengthen the security of these transactions while reducing their time. The author uses a legal methodology to approach it. Findings Blockchain, combined with smart contracts, has both challenges and opportunities for the real estate sector. On the one hand, it may improve procedures, allow EU transactions and the interconnection between public administration. However, to not reduce parties rights, this blockchain should have some special features, such as the possibility of being amended. Originality/value This paper provides a valuable overview of all the intermediaries that could be affected by blockchain protocols. It is of interest of blockchain developers, public administrations and researchers who are working on blockchain and property conveyancing.","[Garcia-Teruel, Rosa M.] Univ Rovira & Virgili, UNESCO Housing Chair, Dept Private Procedural & Tax Law, Tarragona, Spain","Universitat Rovira i Virgili","Garcia-Teruel, RM (corresponding author), Univ Rovira & Virgili, UNESCO Housing Chair, Dept Private Procedural & Tax Law, Tarragona, Spain.","rosamaria.garciat@urv.cat","Garcia Teruel, Rosa Maria/K-5508-2017","Garcia Teruel, Rosa Maria/0000-0002-3215-4608","","","","","34","15","15","7","44","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","2514-9407","2514-9415","","J PROP PLAN ENV LAW","J.

However, the traditional prediction market is centralized, which means the platform is completely controlled by just one person or team. This centralization has bad influence on the platform to obtaining trust from massive users. So it is important for the prediction market industry to decentralize the traditional platform into a decentralized one, and get its control from few person and give it back to a lot of people in the prediction market community. Blockchain is a very promising technology to make it true as it is a popular decentralizing technology. However, existing blockchain technologies like Bitcoin or Ethernum bring about new problems like high energy consumption, expensive fee, and very low system capacity, which is not suitable for the current prediction market. To solve these problems, we propose to combine masternode technology together with blockchain to serve as a decentralized node, and each masternode is deployed and running on an edge server in mobile edge network. The network of masternodes serves together as the decentralized prediction market platform. As we know, it is not easy to run a masternode. So the number of mastemodes is much less than the number of complete nodes of the blockchain. As a result, it is easier to reach the consensus among these mastemodes. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our proposed method is useful.","[Wang, Zhen] Huizhou Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, 46 Yanda Rd, Huizhou, Peoples R China","Huizhou University","Wang, Z (corresponding author), Huizhou Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, 46 Yanda Rd, Huizhou, Peoples R China.","chavez.w@qq.com","","","Doctoral Research Fund of Huizhou University [2018JB007]; Blue Fire Plan Foundation of China [CXZJHZ201704]","Doctoral Research Fund of Huizhou University; Blue Fire Plan Foundation of China","The research was supported by the Doctoral Research Fund of Huizhou University (2018JB007) and the Blue Fire Plan Foundation of China (CXZJHZ201704).","","18","0","0","0","7","CHINA INST COMMUNICATIONS","BEIJING","NO 13 WEST CHANG AN AVENUE, BEIJING, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA","1673-5447","","","CHINA COMMUN","China Commun.","OCT","2020","17","9","","","","","25","33","","","","","","9","Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Telecommunications","NW1MM","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000574775600005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

But, what about the resilience and the reliability of the infrastructures accommodating these services? It is undeniable that the rapid growth of this traffic inside data centers network, caught cloud experts attention's appeal. Also, proposing algorithms and solutions for traffic management becomes essential. In this context, we study the improvement of network QoS performance for intra-data center flows in CamCube server only topology. We have already addressed in previous works the routing problem for online traffic (unicast and multicast) within CamCube topology. Our experimentations show a satisfying results. However, facing this important growth, these solutions present some weaknesses like congestion and high latency for flows treatment. To improve our solutions, we propose in this paper a new Batch routing algorithm within CamCube server only topology network that overcomes these limits. Then, we compare our proposal with the existing shortest path approach. The obtained results show that our proposal outperforms its competitor in terms of packet loss and latency.","[Touihri, Roua; Veillon, Cyril] Devoteam R&D, F-91300 Massy, France; [Touihri, Roua; Alwan, Safwan; Aitsaadi, Nadjib] Univ Paris Est, LiSSi EA 3956, UPEC, F-94400 Vitry Sur Seine, France; [Dandoush, Abdulhalim] ESME Sudria, F-94200 Ivry, France; [Aitsaadi, Nadjib] Univ Paris Saclay, LI PaRAD EA 7432, UVSQ, F-78280 Guyancourt, France","Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay","Touihri, R (corresponding author), Devoteam R&D, F-91300 Massy, France.;Touihri, R (corresponding author), Univ Paris Est, LiSSi EA 3956, UPEC, F-94400 Vitry Sur Seine, France.","","","Alwan, Safwan/0000-0002-4520-8599; Dandoush, Abdulhalim/0000-0003-0681-0701","","","","","16","0","0","1","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1550-3607","","978-1-7281-5089-5","IEEE ICC","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BQ5PR","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000606970304002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Despite the domination of subsidy in reward, the decrease of the mining rate and the imperativeness of fees make the fee market become a pivotal role to motivate miners in the blockchain. However, the current mechanism for selecting transactions into a block poses a risk to the stability of the system, which stems from the vicious competition of users and the insufficient incentives of miners. In this article, we propose a novel transaction selection mechanism by leveraging the Lyapunov optimization and large deviation theory. This article is: 1) fair because the proposed mechanism is not single-factor dominated, both personal utility of the miner and overall utility of the system are taken into account; 2) sustainable since miners are incentivized greatly to guarantee the mining behavior; and 3) robust. The analysis based on the large deviation theory enhances the robustness of the blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider both miner's benefit as well as system benefit to establish a better fee market in the blockchain for IoT enhancement. Our theoretical analyses and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.","[Shi, Hongwei; Wang, Shengling] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Yinhao] Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Informat Sci, Guangzhou 528100, Peoples R China","Beijing Normal University; Guangdong University of Finance & Economics","Wang, SL (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.","hongweishi@mail.bnu.edu.cn; wangshengling@bnu.edu.cn; xyh3984@gmail.com","Xiao, Yinhao/AAV-8398-2021; Shi, Hongwei/GPW-8987-2022; Xiao, Yinhao/ABF-3992-2021","Xiao, Yinhao/0000-0002-9871-9552; Shi, Hongwei/0000-0001-6854-7385; ","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFB2102600]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61772080]; Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Technology and Educational Application, Ministry of Education","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Technology and Educational Application, Ministry of Education","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2019YFB2102600, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61772080, and in part by the Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Technology and Educational Application, Ministry of Education.","","16","5","5","2","11","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2327-4662","","","IEEE INTERNET THINGS","IEEE Internet Things J.","SEPT","2020","7","9","","","","","7941","7948","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2996614","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.2996614","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","NR7UE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000571765000009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this work, we put forth a new formalization of proof-of-work verification by introducing a primitive called Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs). We improve upon the previously known SPV NIPoPoW by proposing a novel NIPoPoW construction using superblocks, blocks that are much heavier than usual blocks, which capture the fact that proof-of-work took place without sending all of it. Unlike a traditional blockchain client which must verify the entire linearly-growing chain of PoWs, clients based on superblock NIPoPoWs require resources only logarithmic in the length of the chain, instead downloading a compressed form of the chain. Superblock NIPoPoWs are thus succinct proofs and, due to their non-interactivity, require only a single message between the prover and the verifier of the transaction. Our construction allows the creation of superlight clients which can synchronize with the network quickly even if they remain offline for large periods of time. Our scheme is provably secure in the Bitcoin Backbone model. From a theoretical point of view, we are the first to propose a cryptographic prover-verifier definition for decentralized consensus protocols and the first to give a construction which can synchronize non-interactively using only a logarithmically-sized message.","[Kiayias, Aggelos] Univ Edinburgh, IOHK, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Miller, Andrew] Univ Illinois, Initiat Cryptocurrencies & Contracts, Urbana, IL USA; [Zindros, Dionysis] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, IOHK, Athens, Greece","University of Edinburgh; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens","Zindros, D (corresponding author), Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, IOHK, Athens, Greece.","akiayias@inf.ed.ac.uk; amiller@cs.umd.edu; dionyziz@di.uoa.gr","","","","","","","19","17","19","2","3","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-51280-4; 978-3-030-51279-8","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2020","12059","","","","","","505","522","","10.1007/978-3-030-51280-4_27","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51280-4_27","","","18","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS3NK","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000713581800026","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Existing standards are complex and lack the adherence of the agents involved to ensure their application. Blockchain technology offers alternatives to unify the standards and their application by consensus algorithm, which considers the validation and secrecy in the insertion of the blocks of transactions in the chain. However, smart contracts can ensure secrecy and the rules of data sharing in blocks in the chain. In this paper, we propose a blockchain architecture with a consensus algorithm that considers data collected in the health and wellness ecosystem, including those obtained by IoT devices and persisted in middleware platforms.

Correspondingly, the manufacturing business has started the transition from selling hardware to selling features (e.g. ;insane mode and ludicrous mode in Tesla Model S). Consequently, a trustworthy system to automate such a process becomes essential. This article introduces a permissioned blockchain-based feature management system for assembly devices. Firstly, it leverages software licensing technology to control assembly devices features. Secondly, by recording the license ownership transaction data in a permissioned blockchain, the approach (1) takes advantage of blockchains trust mechanism and its distributed nature to improve the trustworthiness of the feature management system, and (2) adopts the permissioned blockchain technology to ensure that the license transactions are only visible and applicable to authenticated actors.

To comprehensively evaluate the blockchain technologies, we first construct three-level evaluation indicators in terms of technical, market, and popularity indicators. Then, we propose an improved global DEA-Malmquist index without explicit inputs to assess the dynamic performance of blockchain technologies. Finally, we carry out an empirical analysis to evaluate 31 public blockchains' performance from May 2018 to April 2020. The results indicate that the overall performance of blockchain technologies is basically on the rise.

As the verification of GDPR-compliance, handled by a supervisory authority, is irregularly conducted; it is challenging to be certified that a service provider has been continuously adhering to the GDPR. Furthermore, it is beyond the data owner's capability to perceive whether a service provider complies with the GDPR and effectively protects her personal data. This motivates us to envision a design concept for developing a GDPR-compliant personal data management platform leveraging the emerging blockchain and smart contract technologies. The goals of the platform are to provide decentralised mechanisms to both service providers and data owners for processing personal data; meanwhile, empower data provenance and transparency by leveraging advanced features of the blockchain technology. The platform enables data owners to impose data usage consent, ensures only designated parties can process personal data, and logs all data activities in an immutable distributed ledger using smart contract and cryptography techniques. By honestly participating in the platform, a service provider can be endorsed by the blockchain network that it is fully GDPR-compliant; otherwise, any violation is immutably recorded and is easily figured out by associated parties. We then demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed design concept by developing a profile management platform implemented on top of the Hyperledger Fabric permissioned blockchain framework, following by valuable analysis and discussion.","[Nguyen Binh Truong; Sun, Kai; Guo, Yike] Imperial Coll London, Data Sci Inst, Dept Comp, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Lee, Gyu Myoung] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England","Imperial College London; Liverpool John Moores University; University of Liverpool","Truong, NB (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Data Sci Inst, Dept Comp, London SW7 2AZ, England.","n.truong@inmerial.ac.uk; k.sun@imperial.ac.uk; g.m.lee@ljmu.ac.uk; y.guo@imperial.ac.uk","郭, 伊可/GYD-3212-2022","Lee, Gyu Myoung/0000-0002-2155-5553; Truong, Nguyen/0000-0001-9359-524X","HNA Research Centre for Future Data Ecosystems at Imperial College London","HNA Research Centre for Future Data Ecosystems at Imperial College London","This work was supported by the HNA Research Centre for Future Data Ecosystems at Imperial College London.","","56","86","89","18","86","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","1556-6013","1556-6021","","IEEE T INF FOREN SEC","IEEE Trans.

Making healthcare clearer by creating a blockchain system to eliminate fraud and improve data accuracy is vital. Blockchain can securely interoperable record data such as organs, blood, critical drugs, and keeping medical licenses and certificates. With the emergence of Bitcoin, the first popular blockchain decentralized application, blockchain has become a viable solution for recording transactions in a growing list called blocks which are linked and protected using cryptography. However, with the ever-increasing demand for blockchain professionals and developers, there are few hands-on labs/modules available for training current students, the future developer professionals. The objective is to develop a framework including a series of hands-on labs that would fit individual student's needs for blockchain in public health. This framework will help students to find their current level and propose an appropriate level of the hands-on lab for developing blockchain decentralized - applications in public health. This approach will help students to learn and comprehend the fundamental blockchain concepts systematically. A set of hands-on labs would be built based on real-life scenarios, to enhance their ability to understand and solve real-life cybersecurity problems in healthcare. This integrated approach would expose the students to the cost to risk involved at each stage of the blockchain application for electronic health records.","[Bornelus, Bertony; Chi, Hongmei] Florida A&M Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32307 USA; [Francia, Guillermo A.] Univ West Florida, Pensacola, FL USA","State University System of Florida; Florida A&M University; State University System of Florida; University of West Florida","Bornelus, B (corresponding author), Florida A&M Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32307 USA.","bertony1.bornelus@famu.edu; hongmei.chi@famu.edu; gfranciaiii@uwf.edu","","","National Security Agency [H98230-19-1-0333]","National Security Agency(National Security Agency)","This work was partially supported by the National Security Agency under Grant Number H98230-19-1-0333.and by CyberFlorida (http://cyberflorida.org).","","19","2","2","0","3","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-7105-6","","","","2020","","","","","","","122","126","","10.1145/3374135.3385275","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3374135.3385275","","","5","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS1PY","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000694698300017","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The IoT is being leveraged across various fields of business globally and the number of IoT devices is causing serious security concerns. Since the firmware update of an IoT device is necessary for its lifecycle, secure firmware update of the IoT device is being brought as the first step in IoT security. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Software Updates for Internet of Things (SUIT) working group has started to specify a software update architecture for IoT devices. However, the current SUIT working group adopts a traditional client-server model to distribute firmware images, which potentially causes security risks. The current approach of the SUIT working group is unable to solve a targeting issue and an author-disappearing issue, which is suggested in this paper. Therefore, in this work, we introduce a distributed firmware update architecture based on the SUIT firmware update architecture applying blockchain. Our update architecture can prevent the issues we concern through the characteristics of blockchain, such as decentralization, transparency, and irreversibility. The blockchain network has registration nodes that process registration of manifest and firmware image files from authors, and retrieval nodes that process downloading manifest and firmware image files. The firmware image files are stored in a distributed file system and the hash values of firmware image chunks are stored on the blockchain with manifest files. The proposed architecture in this paper enables the irreversible downloads even in the author-disappearing state and tolerant to a single point of failure.","[Choi, Seoyun; Lee, Jong-Hyouk] Sangmyung Univ, Dept Software, Protocol Engn Lab, Cheonan 31066, South Korea","Sang Myung University","Lee, JH (corresponding author), Sangmyung Univ, Dept Software, Protocol Engn Lab, Cheonan 31066, South Korea.","jonghyouk@smu.ac.kr","","","Sangmyung University","Sangmyung University","This work was supported by the research grant from Sangmyung University.","","18","9","9","4","11","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","37518","37525","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2975920","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2975920","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","LC7XF","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000525545900003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

To ensure the privacy and workability of the image data, it is necessary to encrypt plain image data, retrieve cypher data and verify the authenticity of the data. Public key authenticated searchable encryption (PAEKS) is an effective mechanism to realize the privacy and workability properties of data. However, the existing PAEKS schemes are unable to realize the identity privacy protection of the data owner, and the traditional blockchain system (such as the Bitcoin) cannot achieve these goals directly. To overcome the above drawback, we first present a deniably authenticated searchable encryption scheme for medical image data sharing (DASES) that is based on blockchain and deniably authenticated encryption technology. The DASES takes advantage of blockchain technology to ensure the non-tampered, unforgettable and traceability of the image data, and it also avoids the limitation of the blockchain's own storage and computing power. The DASES can not only withstand inside keyword guessing attack (IKGA) but also provide effective privacy protection and verify the authenticity of medical image data. Hence, it can better protect the privacy of data senders and provide stronger security. Next, we prove that the DASES satisfies the indistinguishability of the ciphertext and trapdoor. It is regrettable that the DASES is less efficient than related schemes in the literature, but its greatest strength is its ability to provide better identity privacy protection and stronger security.","[Zhang, Yu-lei; Wen, Long] Northwest Normal Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yong-jie] Gansu Hlth Vocat Coll, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Cai-fen] Shenzhen Technol Univ, Coll Big Data & Internet, Shenzhen 518000, Peoples R China","Northwest Normal University - China; Shenzhen Technology University","Zhang, YL (corresponding author), Northwest Normal Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.","zhangyl@nwnu.edu.cn; 770293027@qq.com","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61662069]; Higher Educational Scientific Research Foundation of Gansu Province [No.2017A-003, 2018A-207]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Higher Educational Scientific Research Foundation of Gansu Province","This work is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No.61662069, Higher Educational Scientific Research Foundation of Gansu Province under Grant No.2017A-003, and 2018A-207.","","28","1","1","5","35","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1380-7501","1573-7721","","MULTIMED TOOLS APPL","Multimed.

Current blockchain systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum require users to constantly observe the state changes of interest or the events taking place in a blockchain and requires the user to explicitly release the required transactions to respond to the observed events in the blockchain. This paper proposes EventWarden, a decentralized event-driven proxy service for users to outsource transactions in Ethereum-like blockchains. EventWarden employs a novel combination of smart contracts and blockchain logs. EventWarden allows a user to create a proxy smart contract that specifies an interested event and also reserves an arbitrary transaction to release. Upon observing the occurrence of the prescribed event, anyone in the Blockchain network can call the proxy contract to earn the service fee reserved in the contract by proving to the contract that the event has been recorded into blockchain logs, which then automatically triggers the proxy contract to release the reserved transaction. We show that the reserved transaction can only get released from the proxy contract when the prescribed event has taken place. We also demonstrate that as long as a single member in the Blockchain network is incentivized by the service fee to call the proxy contract after the prescribed event has taken place, the reserved transaction is guaranteed to get released. We implement EventWarden over the Ethereum official test network. The results demonstrate that EventWarden is effective and is ready-to-use in practice.","[Li, Chao] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing Key Lab Secur & Privacy Intelligent Trans, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Palanisamy, Balaji] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Comp & Informat, Pittsburgh, PA USA","Beijing Jiaotong University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh","Li, C (corresponding author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing Key Lab Secur & Privacy Intelligent Trans, Beijing, Peoples R China.","li.chao@bjtu.edu.cn; bpalan@pitt.edu","","","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2019RC038]","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","Chao Li acknowledges the partial support by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 2019RC038).","","17","0","0","1","2","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","","","978-1-7281-8786-0","","","","2020","","","","","","","9","16","","10.1109/ICWS49710.2020.00009","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICWS49710.2020.00009","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS0GY","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000682775200002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

More recently, with the advent of blockchain protocols like Bitcoin, consensus has been considered in the permissionless setting where no authentication or even point-to-point communication is available. Yet, despite some positive preliminary results, all attempts to formalize a building block that is sufficient for designing consensus protocols in this setting, rely on a very strong independence assumption about adversarial accesses to the underlying computational resource. In this work, we relax this assumption by putting forth a primitive, which we call signatures of work (SoW). Distinctive features of our new notion are a lower bound on the number of steps required to produce a signature; fast verification; moderate unforgeability-producing a sequence of SoWs, for chosen messages, does not provide an advantage to an adversary in terms of running time; and honest signing time independence-most relevant in concurrent multi-party applications, as we show. Armed with SoW, we then present a new permissionless consensus protocol which is secure assuming an honest majority of computational power, thus in a sense providing a blockchain counterpart to the classical Dolev-Strong consensus protocol.

This is especially true for high computing applications like Artificial Intelligence, Bitcoin Mining, Deep Learning, etc. Airside Economization/free air cooling reduces the mechanical cooling costs by using outside air to cool IT equipment under favorable ambient conditions. In this process, administrators risk their equipment to the exposure of fine particulate/gaseous contaminants that might enter the data center facility with the cooling airflow. Literature suggests that the nature of failures caused by particulate contamination is very intermittent which makes the failures tough to predict. While the recommended filters can remove PM10-2.5, it's the fine and ultra-fine particulates like DPM (Diesel Particulate Matter), corrosive salts of high ionic content like sulfates and nitrates with low DRH (Deliquescent Relative Humidity) values that are the cause of concern. The present investigation utilizes a 3-D CFD modeling of particle-laden flow in a rectangular flow domain, imitating the flow through floor tiles as in a raised floor data center. Literature was reviewed to study various numerical models that have been used for simulating particle dispersion and particle deposition in ventilated rooms, air ducts and particle behavior across physical obstructions of various geometries. A Discrete Phase Modeling approach was chosen using ANSYS FLUENT to calculate trajectories of the dispersed contaminants. 6SigmaRoom was used to predict accurate boundary and flow conditions of the fluid flow leaving the floor tiles.","[Saini, Satyam; Shahi, Pardeep; Bansode, Pratik; Siddarth, Ashwin; Agonafer, Dereje] Univ Texas Arlington, 701 S Nedderman Dr, Arlington, TX 76019 USA","University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington","Saini, S (corresponding author), Univ Texas Arlington, 701 S Nedderman Dr, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.","satyam.saini@mavs.uta.edu","Siddarth, Ashwin/O-8709-2018","Siddarth, Ashwin/0000-0001-6535-9071; Shahi, Pardeep/0000-0002-1539-8782","NSF I/UCRC in Energy-Smart Electronic Systems (ES2)","NSF I/UCRC in Energy-Smart Electronic Systems (ES2)","This work is supported by NSF I/UCRC in Energy-Smart Electronic Systems (ES2).

Thus, renting mining service from cloud providers becomes a reasonable solution, which is called cloud mining. This enables users who want to mine, i.e., miners, to purchase and lease an amount of hashing power from the cloud/edge providers without any hassle of managing the infrastructure. In this paper, we study the interactions among the cloud/edge providers and miners in blockchain using a multi-leader multi-follower game-theoretic approach, in order to support proof-of-work based blockchains application. Due to the inherent complexity of the formulated game, we employ the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to investigate the optimum solution. Utilizing the decomposition characteristics and fast convergence of ADMM, we obtain the optimum results in a distributed manner. Simulation results demonstrate that with the proposed solutions, the optimization of the utilities of miners and the profits of providers can be jointly achieved.","[Xiong, Zehui; Kang, Jiawen; Niyato, Dusit] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Wang, Ping] York Univ, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Poor, H.

Blockchain technology is a peer-to-peer protocol that can be leveraged to keep track of transactions over the internet. Publicized for its use in the bitcoin revolution, the technology provides transparency and traceability that can be used in the management of land rights. When it comes to the formalization of land rights, blockchain technology promises to authenticate owners and other users of land, and provides a fixed ledger of land use rights transactions. At present, blockchain technology is being explored as a proof of concept in several countries to track land titles (state to individual). We extend the idea to capture the granting of land use rights (individual to individual) making use of the decentralization, peer-to-peer nature of blockchain technology. While the technology is not a panacea to all land administration challenges, it can offer an effective means to manage land transactions, provide digital documentation to actors in the informal land rental market and reduce inefficiency in land systems. However, the uptake of the technology in land administration is limited by human related factors. These limitations include, but are not limited to, the accuracy of data being entered into the system, the ability of the system to facilitate data preservation, pre-existing institutional and legal pillars, and the digital divide across communities. Part of overcoming these barriers requires the political will of governments to invest in digital technologies and develop institutional capacities to overcome current limitations to bring land management into the industry 4.0 era.","[Daniel, Desiree; Speranza, Chinwe Ifejika] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Land Syst & Sustainable Land Management Unit, Bern, Switzerland","University of Bern","Daniel, D (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Land Syst & Sustainable Land Management Unit, Bern, Switzerland.","desiree.daniel@giub.unibe.ch","Ifejika Speranza, Chinwe/B-2408-2012","Ifejika Speranza, Chinwe/0000-0003-1927-7635","","","","","46","11","11","3","6","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","2624-7852","","","FRONT BLOCKCHAIN","Front.

This article aims to assess the interplay between four of the key phenomena that has fuelled this development, namely crowdfunding, blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and initial coin offerings (ICOs). By making use of social media analytics, public discussions on social media concerning crowdfunding, blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and ICOs have been systematically tracked in social media over three time periods between the May 6, 2017, and October 2, 2018. In doing so, a total of 197 770 captured posts across social media platforms have been collected and analyzed. The results illustrate that discussions on blockchain technologies dominated the interplay in the first analyzed time period, that discussions on cryptocurrencies and ICOs dominated the interplay in the second analyzed time period, while discussions concerning blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and ICOs highly converge in the third time period. By illustrating this shift over the analyzed time periods and by offering a systematic exploration of key characteristics of the interplay at hand, this article adds to previous literature on entrepreneurial finance by providing an empirical contribution which details the coevolution of these phenomena in recent years.","[Bogusz, Claire Ingram] Stockholm Sch Econ, House Innovat, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Laurell, Christofer] Stockholm Sch Econ, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Sandstrom, Christian] Chalmers Univ Technol, Div Sci Technol & Soc, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Sandstrom, Christian] Ratio Inst, S-10364 Stockholm, Sweden; [Sandstrom, Christian] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden","Stockholm School of Economics; Stockholm School of Economics; Chalmers University of Technology; Jonkoping University","Sandstrom, C (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Div Sci Technol & Soc, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.","claire.ingram@hhs.se; christofer.laurell@hhs.se; christian.sandstrom@chalmers.se","Ingram Bogusz, Claire/Q-5402-2016","Ingram Bogusz, Claire/0000-0001-9160-347X; Sandstrom, Christian/0000-0002-8625-8744","","","","","46","13","13","9","80","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","0018-9391","1558-0040","","IEEE T ENG MANAGE","IEEE Trans.

In most instances, the main cost comes from the required amount of energy for the Proof-of-Work, and this cost is inherent to the design. In addition, useless costs from discarded work (e.g., the so-called Forks) and lack of scalability (in number of users and in rapid transactions) limit their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we present an innovative scheme which eliminates the nonce and thus the burden of the Proof-of-Work which is the main cause of the energy waste in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. We prove that our scheme guarantees a tunable and bounded average number of simultaneous mining whatever the size of the population in competition, thus by making the use of nonce-based techniques unnecessary, achieves scalability without the cost of consuming a large volume of energy. The technique used in the proof of our scheme is based on the analogy of the analysis of a green leader election. The additional difference with Proof-of-Work schemes (beyond the suppression of the nonce field that is triggering most of the waste), is the introduction of (what we denote as) empty blocks which aim are to call regular blocks following a staircase set of values. Our scheme reduces the risk of Forks and provides tunable scalability for the number of users and the speed of block generation. We also prove using game theoretical analysis that our scheme is resilient to unfair competitive investments (e.g., 51 percent attack) and block nursing.","[Jacquet, Philippe] Nokia Bell Labs, Nozay, France; [Mans, Bernard] Macquarie Univ, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Nokia Corporation; Macquarie University","Mans, B (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.","philippe.jacquet@nokia-bell-labs.com; bemard.mans@mq.edu.au","","Mans, Bernard/0000-0001-7897-2043","Australian Research Council, Australia [DP140100118, DP170102794]","Australian Research Council, Australia(Australian Research Council)","For the research, B.M. was partially supported by the Australian Research Council, Australia Grants DP140100118 and DP170102794.

While many variations of attention have been developed over recent years, all share a common component in the application of a softmax function to normalize the attention weights, in order to transform them into valid mixing coefficients. In this paper, we aim to improve the modeling flexibility of a generic attention module by innovatively replacing this softmax operation with a learnable softmax, in which the normalizing functions are also adapted from the data. Specifically, our generalized softmax builds upon recent work in learning activation functions for deep networks, in particular the kernel activation function and its extensions. We describe the application of the proposed technique for the challenging case of time series forecasting with the dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (DA-RNN), an innovative model for predicting time series that employs two different attention modules for handling exogenous factors and long-term dependencies. A series of real-world benchmarks are used to show that simply plugging-in our generalized attention model can improve results on all datasets, even when keeping the number of trainable parameters in the model constant. To further evaluate the algorithm, we collect a novel dataset for predicting the Bitcoin closing exchange rate, a problem of high practical significance lately. Finally, to foster research in the topic, we also release both the dataset and our model as an open source extensible library. Over a baseline DA-RNN, our proposed model delivers an improvement of MAR ranging from 6% to 15% using our newly-released dataset. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Its most popular application thus far is in payment system applications, e.g., bitcoin. This disruptive technology is expected to contribute significant business value to multiple industry sectors, including supply chain management (SCM), where it can provide greater visibility, accountability and trust in interorganizational business collaboration. In this article, we review some fundamental concepts of Hyperledger Fabric, one of the most mature permissioned blockchain implementations. Further, we use the context of a food supply chain to highlight key design and implementation challenges for blockchain, and provide a strategic assessment of its prospects. Our aim is to dispel misguided notions and myths about blockchain as a silver bullet for all businesses. We believe it is important to penetrate the hype to allow a more realistic understanding of this technology. Blockchain is a high-cost, high-overhead storage medium. It is viable only when its higher cost is counterbalanced by the set of benefits that are identified by a careful and thorough analysis of the business. Thus, it will be used mainly for storing important data related to interorganizational transactions among partners where trust is lacking and provenance and visibility are critical.

Standard derandomization techniques for discrete logarithm-based signatures such as RFC 6979, which make the signing procedure immune to catastrophic failures in the randomness generation, are not applicable to multisignatures as an attacker could trick an honest user into producing two different partial signatures with the same randomness, which would reveal the user's secret key. In this paper, we propose a variant of MuSig in which signers generate their nonce deterministically as a pseudorandom function of the message and all signers' public keys and prove that they did so by providing a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof to their cosigners. The resulting scheme, which we call MuSig-DN, is the first Schnorr multi-signature scheme with deterministic signing. Therefore its signing protocol is robust against failures in the randomness generation as well as attacks trying to exploit the statefulness of the signing procedure, e.g., virtual machine rewinding attacks. As an additional benefit, a signing session in MuSig-DN requires only two rounds instead of three as required by all previous Schnorr multi-signatures including MuSig. To instantiate our construction, we identify a suitable algebraic pseudorandom function and provide an efficient implementation of this function as an arithmetic circuit. This makes it possible to realize MuSig-DN efficiently using zero-knowledge proof frameworks for arithmetic circuits which support inputs given in Pedersen commitments, e.g., Bulletproofs. We demonstrate the practicality of our technique by implementing it for the secp256k1 elliptic curve used in Bitcoin.","[Nick, Jonas; Ruffing, Tim; Wuille, Pieter] Blockstream, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Seurin, Yannick] ANSSI, Paris, France","","Nick, J (corresponding author), Blockstream, Victoria, BC, Canada.","jonas@n-ck.net; crypto@timruffing.de; yannick.seurin@m4x.org; pieter@wuille.net","","Wuille, Pieter/0000-0002-5530-4541","","","","","68","14","14","0","1","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","","978-1-4503-7089-9","","","","2020","","","","","","","1717","1731","","10.1145/3372297.3417236","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3372297.3417236","","","15","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BS7XQ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000768470400102","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Existing blockchain systems have successfully either resolved the scalability issue by advancing the distributed consensus protocols from the control plane, or complemented the security issue by updating the block structure and encryption algorithms from the data plane. Yet, we argue that the underlying P2P network plane remains as an important but unaddressed barrier for accelerating the overall blockchain system performance, which can be discussed from how fast and reliable the network is. In order to improve the blockchain network performance about enabling fast and reliable broadcast, we establish a trust-enhanced blockchain P2P topology which takes transmission rate and transmission reliability into consideration. Transmission rate reflects blockchain network speed to disseminate transactions and blocks, and transmission reliability reveals whether transmission rate changes drastically on unreliable network connection. This paper presents BlockP2P-EP, a novel trust-enhanced blockchain topology to accelerate transmission rate and meanwhile retain transmission reliability. BlockP2P-EP first operates the geographical proximity sensing clustering, which leverages K-Means algorithm for gathering proximity peer nodes into clusters. It follows by the hierarchical topological structure that ensures strong connectivity and small diameter based on node attribute classification. Then we propose establishing trust-enhanced network topology. On top of the trust-enhanced blockchain topology, BlockP2P-EP conducts the parallel spanning tree broadcast algorithm to enable fast data broadcast among nodes both intra- and inter- clusters. Finally, we adopt an effective node inactivation detection method to reduce network load. To verify the validity of BlockP2P-EP protocol, we carefully design and implement a blockchain network simulator. Evaluation results show that BlockP2P-EP can exhibit promising network performance in terms of transmission rate and transmission reliability compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum.","[Hao, Weifeng; Zeng, Jiajie; Dai, Xiaohai; Xiao, Jiang; Hua, Qiang-Sheng; Chen, Hanhua; Jin, Hai] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Serv Comp Technol & Syst Lab, Natl Engn Res Ctr Big Data Technol & Syst, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Hao, Weifeng; Zeng, Jiajie; Dai, Xiaohai; Xiao, Jiang; Hua, Qiang-Sheng; Chen, Hanhua; Jin, Hai] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Cluster & Grid Comp Lab, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Li, Kuan-Ching] Providence Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taichung 43301, Taiwan","Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Providence University - Taiwan","Xiao, J (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Serv Comp Technol & Syst Lab, Natl Engn Res Ctr Big Data Technol & Syst, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.","jiangxiao@hust.edu.cn; kuancli@pu.edu.tw; hjin@hust.edu.cn","Li, Kuan-ching/S-4073-2019","Li, Kuan-ching/0000-0003-1381-4364; Xiao, Jiang/0000-0002-4216-0497; Hua, Qiang-Sheng/0000-0002-3909-5719; Dai, Xiaohai/0000-0001-7822-4512","Technology Innovation Project of Hubei Province of China [2019AEA171]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFB1004800]","Technology Innovation Project of Hubei Province of China; National Key Research and Development Program of China","This work is supported by the Technology Innovation Project of Hubei Province of China under Grant No. 2019AEA171, National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant No. 2018YFB1004800.

However, current centralized solutions are unable to handle a massive number of micropayments from untrusted devices. Blockchains are promising technologies suitable for solving some of these challenges. Particularly, permissionless blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin have drawn the attention of the research community. However, the increasingly large-scale deployments of blockchain reveal some of their scat ability limitations. Prominent proposals to scale the payment system include off-chain protocols such as payment channels. However, the leading proposals assume powerful nodes with an always-on connection and frequent synchronization. These assumptions require in practice significant communication, memory, and computation capacity, whereas IoT devices face substantial constraints in these areas. Existing approaches also do not capture the logic and process of IoT, where applications need to process locally collected sensor data to allow for full use of IoT micro-payments. In this paper, we present TinyEVM, a novel system to generate and execute off-chain smart contracts based on sensor data. TinyEVM's goal is to enable IoT devices to perform micro-payments and, at the same time, address the device constraints. We investigate the trade-offs of executing smart contracts on low-power IoT devices using TinyEVM. We test our system with 7,000 publicly verified smart contracts, where TinyEVM achieves to deploy 93% of them without any modification. Finally, we evaluate the execution of off-chain smart contracts in terms of run-time performance, energy, and memory requirements on IoT devices. Notably, we find that low-power devices can deploy a smart contract in 215 ms on average, and they can complete an off-chain payment in 584 ms on average.","[Profentzas, Christos; Almgren, Magnus; Landsiedel, Olaf] Chalmers Univ Technol, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Landsiedel, Olaf] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany","Chalmers University of Technology; University of Kiel","Profentzas, C (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Gothenburg, Sweden.","chrpro@chalmers.se; magnus.almgren@chalmers.se; ol@infonnatik.uni-kiel.de","","Almgren, Magnus/0000-0002-3383-9617","Swedish Research Council (VR) through the project AgreeOnIT; Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) through the project RICS; Vinnova; Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) through the project RIOT","Swedish Research Council (VR) through the project AgreeOnIT(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) through the project RICS; Vinnova(Vinnova); Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) through the project RIOT","This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council (VR) through the project AgreeOnIT, the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) through the projects RICS and RIOT, and the Vinnova-funded project KIDSAM.","","36","1","1","2","5","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","1063-6927","","978-1-7281-7002-2","INT CON DISTR COMP S","","","2020","","","","","","","507","518","","10.1109/ICDCS47774.2020.00025","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS47774.2020.00025","","","12","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR7JC","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000667971400047","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It assesses the possibility of civil circulation of a digital property right as an economic and legal segment without clear legal regulation. It analyzes the judicial practice related to confidentiality, acquisition, and trading of virtual currency. The article justifies the ability to integrate a single digital currency- CRYPTOBRICS, a single equivalent for all payments in the form of cryptocurrency within the framework of BRICS for settlements and increase in the trade exchange volume on these international platforms. This will provide for the legalization and consolidation of the legal framework of cryptocurrency within the context of objects of civil rights, allowing BRICS members to become regulatory leaders in the field of digital assets. We formulated a proposal to create an international agreement defining the parameters of the digital currency issue based on blockchain technology for interstate transactions, which allows the BRICS counties to establish the next stage of their mutual integration for the free trade zone and the customs union. Unifying the civil circulation of cryptocurrency and using the platform of modern non-monetary digital circulation as our foundation, we concluded that BTC can be classified as a type of digital property right. The article justified the theoretical definition of digital property right in the form of cryptocurrency as a resource stored in a device or electronic system which allows the end user to complete transactions using virtual currency and denominated in another payment unit, as opposed to currencies issued by sovereign states.

Since the time interval between the generation of blocks is very short (about 15s), block propagation time in an inefficient network is not negligible compared with the block time interval. This lead to the production of a large number of orphan blocks. In order to solve the security problems that may be caused by the orphan block and improve the transaction processing efficiency, Ethereum introduces the uncle block mechanism, i.e., an orphan block may get part of minted reward if it gets a reference by a regular block. In this paper, we show the weakness of the uncle block mechanism. Firstly, we describe the specific differences of Ethereum selfish and stubborn mining in every state from the ones in Bitcoin. Secondly, we simulate possible attacks, and the results show that the Ethereum selfish and stubborn mining strategies not only increase the reward of an attacker but also decrease the security threshold. The security threshold refers to the proportion of the attacker & x2019;s computational power that needs to be achieved in order to obtain a higher reward than he should. In a practical network congestion rate, the security threshold are weakened to 0.129 and 0.216 against the Lead stubborn mining strategy and the original selfish mining strategy, respectively. When the congestion rate is rising, the reward is increasing and the threshold is decreasing. Thirdly, possible strategies are evaluated to find out the optimal one in different settings. Fourthly, we also extend the evaluation by combining three eclipse attack strategies with selfish or stubborn mining. Most of combinations bring more advantages to an attacker than a single strategy.","[Liu, Yizhong] Beihang Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Hei, Yiming; Xu, Tongge; Liu, Jianwei] Beihang Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Beihang University; Beihang University","Xu, TG (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.","xutg@buaa.edu.cn","Liu, Yizhong/AAT-2895-2020","Liu, Yizhong/0000-0002-6129-3260; Hei, Yiming/0000-0003-0794-9932; Xu, Tongge/0000-0002-0135-7226","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC0830804]; MIIT of China [IIIDP-9.1-2018]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61972018, 61932014]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; MIIT of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2018YFC0830804, in part by the 2018 Industrial Internet Innovation and Development Project of the MIIT of China under Grant IIIDP-9.1-2018, and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61972018 and Grant 61932014.","","25","11","12","2","4","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2020","8","","","","","","17489","17499","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2967861","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2967861","","","11","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","LB6ON","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000524753200081","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Its cryptographic security relies on asymmetric cryptography, such as ECC, RSA. However, with the surprising development of quantum technology, asymmetric cryptography schemes mentioned above would become vulnerable. Recently, lattice-based cryptography scheme was proposed to be secure against attacks in the quantum era. In 2018, with the aid of Bonsai Trees technology, Yin et al. [Yin, Wen, Li et al. (2018)] proposed a lattice-based authentication method which can extend a lattice space to multiple lattice spaces accompanied by the corresponding key. Although their scheme has theoretical significance, it is unpractical in actual situation due to extremely large key size and signature size. In this paper, aiming at tackling the critical issue of transaction size, we propose a post quantum blockchain over lattice. By using SampleMat and signature without trapdoor, we can reduce the key size and signature size of our transaction authentication approach by a significant amount. Instead of using a whole set of vectors as a basis, we can use only one vector and rotate it enough times to form a basis. Based on the hardness assumption of Short Integer Solution (SIS), we demonstrate that the proposed anti-quantum transaction authentication scheme over lattice provides existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen-message attacks in the random oracle. As compared to the Yin et al. [Yin, Wen, Li et al. (2018)] scheme, our scheme has better performance in terms of energy consumption, signature size and signing key size. As the underlying lattice problem is intractable even for quantum computers, our scheme would work well in the quantum age.","[Zhang, Xiao; Wu, Faguo; Yao, Wang; Zheng, Zhiming] Beihang Univ, Sch Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiao; Wu, Faguo; Yao, Wang; Zheng, Zhiming] Minist Educ, Key Lab Math Informat & Behav Semant, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiao; Wu, Faguo; Yao, Wang; Zheng, Zhiming] Peng Cheng Lab, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiao; Wu, Faguo; Yao, Wang; Zheng, Zhiming] Beihang Univ, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Big Data & Brain Comp, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wenhua] Aviat Ind Dev Res Ctr China, Beijing, Peoples R China","Beihang University; Peng Cheng Laboratory; Beihang University; Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC)","Yao, W (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Sch Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.;Yao, W (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Key Lab Math Informat & Behav Semant, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.;Yao, W (corresponding author), Peng Cheng Lab, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.;Yao, W (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Big Data & Brain Comp, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.","yaowang@buaa.edu.cn","","","Major Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [11290141]","Major Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The authors wish to express their appreciation to the reviewers for their helpful suggestions which greatly improved the presentation of this paper.

In the case of bitcoin, its category is not clear. I consider the superficial subjective value argument often put forward by nonmonetary economists and a more sophisticated payments technology argument. After dismissing both, I argue that there are two reasonable views on the value of bitcoin. One might claim bitcoin lacks intrinsic worth, in which case its value depends on foresight and coordination. Alternatively, one might claim that bitcoin has intrinsic worth, even if no one else accepts it, because some users have peculiar preferences. In either case, bitcoin's existence calls into question the practical relevance of the regression theorem.","[Luther, William J.] Kenyon Coll, Gambier, OH 43022 USA","Kenyon College","Luther, WJ (corresponding author), Kenyon Coll, Gambier, OH 43022 USA.","","","","","","","","34","13","13","1","19","ASSOC PRIVATE ENTERPRISE EDUCATION","CHATTANOOGA","313 FLETCHER HALL, DEPT 6106, 615 MCCALLIE AVE, CHATTANOOGA, TN 37403 USA","0890-913X","","","J PRIV ENTERP","J.

This paper examines the impact of cryptocurrency issuances on subsequent cryptocurrency returns. It is argued that as Tether is the undisputed 'stable coin', the minting of new Tether acts similarly to monetary expansion in cryptocurrency markets, inflating the prices of Bitcoin. We construct a VAR model and show contrary to investor expectations, Tether issuances do not impact subsequent Bitcoin returns, however, they do impact traded volumes. We also document an increase in Tether trading following a subsequent decrease in Bitcoin returns. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Previously, some heuristics based on transaction structural rules or observations were found and used for Bitcoin address clustering. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method to achieve address-user mapping. We define addresses by their transactional behaviors and seek concealed patterns and characteristics of users that can help us distinguish the owner of a certain address from millions of others. We propose a system that learns a mapping from address representations to a compact Euclidean space where distances directly correspond to a measure of address similarity. We train a deep neural network for address behavior embedding and optimization to finally obtain an address feature vector for each address. We identify owners of addresses through address verification, recognition and clustering, where the implementation relies directly on the distance between address feature vectors. We set up an address-user pairing dataset with extensive collections and careful sanitation. We tested our method using the dataset and proved its efficiency. In contrast to heuristic-based methods, our model shows great performance in Bitcoin user identification.","[Shao, Wei; Li, Hang; Chen, Mengqi; Jia, Chunfu; Wang, Zhi] Nankai Univ, Coll Cyberspace Secur, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chunbo] Civil Aviat Univ China, Informat Secur Evaluat Ctr Civil Aviat, Tianjin 300300, Peoples R China","Nankai University; Civil Aviation University of China","Jia, CF (corresponding author), Nankai Univ, Coll Cyberspace Secur, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China.","cfjia@nankai.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61772291]; Science Foundation of Tianjin [17JCZDJC30500]; Open Project Foundation of Information Security Evaluation Center of Civil Aviation, Civil Aviation University of China [CAAC-ISECCA-201702]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science Foundation of Tianjin(Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin); Open Project Foundation of Information Security Evaluation Center of Civil Aviation, Civil Aviation University of China","C.

Previous literature has covered only a small extent of the highly volatile period during the last months of 2017 and the beginning of 2018. To examine the potential price drivers, we use the Autoregressive Distributed Lag and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity approach. Our study identifies the technological factor Hashrate as irrelevant for modeling Bitcoin price dynamics. This irrelevance is due to the underlying code that makes the supply of Bitcoins deterministic, and it stands in contrast to previous literature that has included Hashrate as a crucial independent variable. Moreover, the empirical findings indicate that the price of Bitcoin is affected by returns on the S&P 500 and Google searches, showing consistency with results from previous literature. In contrast to previous literature, we find the CBOE volatility index (VIX), oil, gold, and Bitcoin transaction volume to be insignificant.","[Kjaerland, Frode; Khazal, Aras; Krogstad, Erlend A.; Nordstrom, Frans B.

The Bitcoin network creates a complex system of economic incentives that governs its inner working, impacting the network's security guarantees and its evolution. Recent development of Bitcoin as a speculative asset and the herein skyrocketing Bitcoin price greatly incentivize participation in the network. We posit that the expansion in Bitcoin miner population and speculative transactions may not be socially desirable. The increased competition in Bitcoin mining not only exacerbates energy consumption and environmental cost, but also makes the risky mining business much riskier. In addition to the risk of unstable reward flows, the fluctuation in Bitcoin price makes the profitability of mining more uncertain. This research studies an alternative socially optimal model for the Bitcoin market (and other cryptocurrencies in general). Through equilibrium analysis, we emphasize the need to limit speculation in Bitcoin transactions, improve efficiency, diversify currency portfolio, and minimize negative externalities of the Bitcoin mining business.","[Li, Zhen] Albion Coll, Dept Econ & Management, Albion, MI 49224 USA; [Liao, Qi] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA","Albion College; Central Michigan University","Li, Z (corresponding author), Albion Coll, Dept Econ & Management, Albion, MI 49224 USA.","zli@albion.edu; liao1q@cmich.edu","","","","","","","14","2","2","2","17","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-5500-9","","","","2018","","","","","","","582","586","","10.1109/ICISCE.2018.00126","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICISCE.2018.00126","","","5","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BM3FR","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000462044200116","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, its topology is still unknown due to security concerns. In this paper, we design and implement a fast and efficient framework named BTCmap to discover and map the Bitcoin network topology. Our BTCmap framework includes two modules viz., a sniffer to collect the local addresses database of each peer, and a Bitcoin peer emulator to select neighbours and generate the topology. Our analyses show that to remain within 1% confidence interval, we have a window of 56 minutes 40 seconds for collecting the local address databases from all peers. Within this time duration, BTCmap requests more than 8200 reachable peers to map the real Bitcoin network topology.

These findings are relevant for investors and policymakers since Bitcoin is a financial asset without any connection to the measures of central banks.","[Vidal-Tomas, David] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Ibanez, Ana] Univ Valencia, Dept Corp Finance, Ave Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain","Universitat Jaume I; University of Valencia","Ibanez, A (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Dept Corp Finance, Ave Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.","dvidal@uji.es; ana.m.ibanez@uv.es","Vidal-Tomas, David/ABB-5697-2020","Vidal-Tomas, David/0000-0003-4519-0592; Ibanez, Ana M/0000-0003-0362-5535","Spanish Ministry of Education [FPU2015/01434]","Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government)","The authors would like to thank the Editor and the referee for their comments that improved the paper.

To address this issue, numerous solutions have been proposed, including blocksize expansion, off-chain transactions and block structure modification. Among them, Bitcoin-NG, a scalable blockchain protocol introduced by Eyal et al. in USENIX 2016, improves scalability while simultaneously avoiding the deterioration of other metrics in the network. Bitcoin-NG has two types of blocks: key blocks for leader election and microblocks that contain ledger entries. Eyal et al. assert that the proportion of fee allocation of transactions in microblocks is bounded by miners' mining power ratio out of all mining power in the system. Specifically, the upper bound is determined by the incentive sub-mechanism of longest chain extension, while the lower bound determined by the incentive sub-mechanism of transaction inclusion. We revisit the incentive mechanism of Bitcoin-NG. We point out that Eyal et al. neglect on the calculation of lower bound and manifest the over-simplification in the analysis of upper bound in detail. After that, the correct incentive mechanism is derived. Finally, we put forward an optimal proportion of transaction fee distribution.","[Yin, Jiayuan; Zhang, Zongyang; Liu, Jianwei] Beihang Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Changren] Beihang Univ, Sch Automat Sci & Elect Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zongyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, State Key Lab Informat Secur, Beijing, Peoples R China","Beihang University; Beihang University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Engineering, CAS","Zhang, ZY (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhang, ZY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, State Key Lab Informat Secur, Beijing, Peoples R China.","yinjiayuan@buaa.edu.cn; 14231017@buaa.edu.cn; zongyangzhang@buaa.edu.cn; liujianwei@buaa.edu.cn","","","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB1400700]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [4182033]; State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences [2017-MS-02]; Beihang Jinhua Beidou Application Research Institute [BARI1702]","National Key R&D Program of China; Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Beihang Jinhua Beidou Application Research Institute","The author thank Ying Gao and Feng Wang for their valuable comments on earlier versions of this manuscript.

In comparison to other digital payment solutions, Bitcoin is based on a peer-to-peer electronic cash system using 'the blockchain'. This innovative technology allows for decentralised storage and movement of currency in a fully anonymous way, introducing advantageous methods for encrypted security and faster transactions (Hagiu and Beach, 2014). Scepticism regards Bitcoin's foundation, energy consumption and price volatility, however, did not take long to arise (Holthaus, 2017). Ten years from its white paper release, Bitcoin is further supported by the same drivers which could sustain its growth as the future of digital payments (Russo, 2018). In order to investigate the key drivers and feasibility of acceptance, a London based survey was used to understand the desirability of Bitcoin as a day-to-day tool for digital payments. Additionally, this research analysed Bitcoin's stakeholders and forecast drivers of sustainability for its application to become the future of the payment industry. A space which relies on policies that involve multiple layers of society, governments, regulators and tech-firms, all on a global scale. The findings confirmed how the increasing lack of trust of political and financial institutions, coupled with the increasing cases of data-breaches by tech-firms, encouraged over 70% of respondents to consider more decentralised and anonymous methods for their day-to-day actions; like payments. Policy makers need to cope with societies increasingly separating politically but gathering together digitally (LBS, 2017). For Bitcoin to truly establish itself as a global digital payment solution, key stakeholder acceptance must converge alongside the introduction of more robust regulation.","[Valente, Andrea; Atkinson, David; Clifford, John] Pearson Coll London, 190 High Holborn, London WC1V 7BH, England","","Valente, A (corresponding author), Pearson Coll London, 190 High Holborn, London WC1V 7BH, England.","av150@pearsoncollege.com; david.atkinson@pearsoncollege.com; john.clifford@pearsoncollege.com","","","","","","","26","0","0","1","7","VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY","VARAZDIN","MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA","1849-6903","1849-7535","","EC SOC DEVELOP","","","2018","","","","","","","206","217","","","","","","12","Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics; Development Studies","BP1SG","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000540723300025","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Bitcoin is not a monetary generated by a government. Analyzing the public dataset and exploring its statistical property can uncover some hidden facts in cryptocurrency and the blockchain protocol. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey. First is to provide an up-to-date literature survey on Bitcoin transaction analysis, and second is to understand the hidden facts that could be revealed by analyzing Bitcoin transactions. To provide a comprehensive survey, we categorize existing analysis based on anonymity, user behavior, wealth accumulation and currency rate prediction.

Bitcoin peer-to-peer transactions are independent of the banking system, facilitating foreign exchanges with low transaction fees, such as remittances, and offering a high degree of anonymity. These opportunities together with other key factors led the Bitcoin to become extremely popular and caused its price to skyrocket during 2017 (Henry et al. in JDigit Bank 2(4):311-337, 2018).However, while the Bitcoin blockchain attracts a lot of attention, it remains difficult to investigate where this attention comes from, due to the pseudo-anonymity of the system, and consequently to appreciate its social impact. Here we make an attempt to characterize the adoption of the Bitcoin blockchain by country. In the first part of the work we show that information about the number of Bitcoin software client downloads, the IP addresses that act as relays for the transactions, and the Internet searches about Bitcoin provide together a coherent picture of the system evolution in different countries. Using these quantities as a proxy for user adoption, we identify several socio-economic indexes such as the GDP per capita, freedom of trade and the Internet penetration as key variables correlated with the degree of user adoption.In the second part of the work, we build a network of Bitcoin transactions between countries using the IP addresses of nodes relaying transactions and we develop an augmented version of the gravity model of trade in order to identify socio-economic factors linked to the flow of Bitcoin between countries. In a nutshell our study provides a new insight on Bitcoin adoption by country and on the potential socio-economic drivers of the international Bitcoin flow.","[Parino, Francesco; Gauvin, Laetitia] ISI Fdn, Data Sci Lab, Turin, Italy; [Beiro, Mariano G.] Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, INTECIN, Fac Ingn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires","Gauvin, L (corresponding author), ISI Fdn, Data Sci Lab, Turin, Italy.","laetitia.gauvin@isi.it","","","Lagrange Project of the ISI Foundation - CRT Foundation","Lagrange Project of the ISI Foundation - CRT Foundation","The authors acknowledge support from the Lagrange Project of the ISI Foundation funded by the CRT Foundation.

The three Bitcoin addresses disclosed in this blackmail event are only restricted to receivers accepting Bitcoin sent by victims, and no further transaction has been found yet. Therefore, we acquire and verify experimental data by example of similar Bitcoin blackmail virus CryptoLocker occurred in 2013. We focus on how to track malicious Bitcoin transactions, and adopt a new heuristic clustering method to acquire incidence relation between addresses of Bitcoin and improved Louvain clustering algorithm to further acquire incidence relation between users. In addition, through a lot of experiments, we compare the performance of our algorithm with another related work. The new heuristic clustering method can improve comprehensiveness and accuracy of the results. The improved Louvain clustering algorithm can increase working efficiency. Specifically, we propose a method acquiring internal relationship between Bitcoin addresses and users, so as to make Bitcoin transaction deanonymisation possible, and realize a better utilization of Bitcoin in the future.","[Zheng, Baokun; Zhu, Liehuang; Shen, Meng; Yang, Jing; Gao, Feng; Li, Yandong; Zhang, Chuan] Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Baokun] China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Du, Xiaojiang] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Liu, Sheng; Yin, Shu] Union Mobile Financial Technol Co Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China","Beijing Institute of Technology; China University of Political Science & Law; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University","Shen, M (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.","zhengbk168@163.com; liehuangz@bit.edu.cn; shenmeng@bit.edu.cn; dxj@ieee.org; jingy@bit.edu.cn; gaofengbit@foxmail.com; leeyandong@bit.edu.cn; chuanzdlut@163.com; liusheng@umfintech.com; yinshu@umfintech.com","","","National Science Foundation of China [61602039]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [4164098]; CCF-Venustech Open Research Fund; BIT-UMF research and development fund; Education and Teaching Reform Project of China University of Political Science and Law [1000/10717130]","National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); CCF-Venustech Open Research Fund; BIT-UMF research and development fund; Education and Teaching Reform Project of China University of Political Science and Law","This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation of China under Grant 61602039, in part by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation under Grant 4164098, in part by CCF-Venustech Open Research Fund, in part by BIT-UMF research and development fund, and in part by Education and Teaching Reform Project of China University of Political Science and Law under Grant 1000/10717130.","","26","0","0","0","11","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES","1867-8211","","978-3-319-90775-8; 978-3-319-90774-1","L N INST COMP SCI SO","","","2018","235","","","","","","313","323","","10.1007/978-3-319-90775-8_25","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-90775-8_25","","","11","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Information Science & Library Science; Management; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Computer Science; Engineering; Information Science & Library Science; Business & Economics; Telecommunications","BL1WL","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000448503500025","View Full Record in Web of Science"

At the paper's heart is the paradox that if Bitcoin succeeds in its own terms as an ideology, it will fail in practical terms as a form of money. The main reason for this is that the new currency is premised on the idea of money as a 'thing' that must be abstracted from social life in order for it to be protected from manipulation by bank intermediaries and political authorities. The image is of a fully mechanized currency that operates over and above social life. In practice, however, the currency has generated a thriving community around its political ideals, relies on a high degree of social organization in order to be produced, has a discernible social structure, and is characterized by asymmetries of wealth and power that are not dissimilar from the mainstream financial system. Unwittingly, then, Bitcoin serves as a powerful demonstration of the relational character of money.","[Dodd, Nigel] London Sch Econ, Sociol, London, England","University of London; London School Economics & Political Science","Dodd, N (corresponding author), London Sch Econ, Sociol, London, England.","n.b.dodd@lse.ac.uk","","","","","","","43","95","95","2","20","SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD","LONDON","1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","0263-2764","1460-3616","","THEOR CULT SOC","Theory Cult.

The question that remains however is whether its price movements are linked with its transaction activity - a critical element of its growing market microstructure. Using number of Bitcoin transactions and unique addresses, respectively, to proxy for transaction activity, it is shown that a one standard deviation shock to transaction activity leads to just over a 0.30% gain in returns on the third day following the shock. By the sixth day, there is a reversal in price behavior and any such gams are expunged. When comparing the bidirectional linkages between returns and transaction activity, it is shown here that the contribution of return shocks to transaction activity is quantitatively larger in magnitude.

Data is prepared for time series analysis by performing data preprocessing steps such as time stamp conversion and feature selection. Although the time series analysis has a univariate characteristics, it is aimed to include some additional variables to each model to improve the forecasting accuracy. Those additional variables are selected based on different correlation studies between cryptocurrencies and real currencies. The model selection for both ARIMA and PROPHET is done by using threefold splitting technique considering the time series characteristics of the dataset. The threefold splitting technique gave the optimum ratios for training, validation, and test sets. Filially two different models are created and compared in terms of performance metrics.

For a transaction chain we call transaction chain frequency the number of transactions of the chain divided by the time interval of the chain. In this paper, we first analyze to which extent Bitcoin transactions are involved in high frequency transaction chains, in the short and in the long term. Based on this analysis, we then argue that a large fraction of transactions do not refer to explicit human activity, namely to transactions between users that trade goods or services. Finally, we show that most of the transactions are involved into chains whose frequency is roughly stable over time and that we call Bitcoin Heartbeat.","[Di Battista, Giuseppe; Di Donato, Valentino; Pizzonia, Maurizio] Roma Tre Univ, Dept Engn, Rome, Italy","Roma Tre University","Di Battista, G (corresponding author), Roma Tre Univ, Dept Engn, Rome, Italy.","gdb@ing.uniroma3.it; didonato@ing.uniroma3.it; pizzonia@ing.uniroma3.it","","","","","","","16","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-319-75178-8; 978-3-319-75177-1","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","10659","","","","","","507","516","","10.1007/978-3-319-75178-8_41","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-75178-8_41","","","10","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT7UI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000851014500041","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Unfortunately, numerous seminal works have demonstrated that Bitcoin only offers weak anonymity in practice. Indeed, the practical technologies of clustering and flow analysis are much effective for tracing Bitcoin transaction and thereby revealing the owner involved. Otherwise said, user's privacy in Bitcoin has been sadly degenerated to be linkable. In this paper, we propose a completely decentralized scheme that can provide full anonymity in Bitcoin. The idea behind the output is to exploit a secure escrow address, which is consensual by all the involved users. The escrow address is generated from the trick of cryptographically secure distributed key generation and can then be used for mixing transactions in Bitcoin. Our protocol is secure against malicious adversaries. The users can jointly perform the protocol and successfully accomplish the transaction without the help of any (trusted) third party and no extra fees. Besides, our proposal is completely compatible with the current Bitcoin architecture.","[Wang, Qi; Li, Xiangxue] East China Normal Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Yu, Yu] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200000, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiangxue; Yu, Yu] Xian Univ Posts & Telecommun, Natl Engn Lab Wireless Secur, Xian 710121, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiangxue; Yu, Yu] Westone Cryptol Res Ctr, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China","East China Normal University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Xi'an University of Posts & Telecommunications","Li, XX (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.;Yu, Y (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200000, Peoples R China.;Li, XX; Yu, Y (corresponding author), Xian Univ Posts & Telecommun, Natl Engn Lab Wireless Secur, Xian 710121, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Li, XX; Yu, Y (corresponding author), Westone Cryptol Res Ctr, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China.","xxli@cs.ecnu.edu.cn; yuyu@yuyu.hk","","Li, Xiangxue/0000-0002-1779-6178; Wang, Qi/0000-0002-6201-7890","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61472249, 61472114, 61572192]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0802003]; International Science and Technology Cooperation and Exchange Projects of Shaanxi Province [2016KW-038]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; International Science and Technology Cooperation and Exchange Projects of Shaanxi Province","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61472249, Grant 61472114, and Grant 61572192, in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFB0802003, and in part by the International Science and Technology Cooperation and Exchange Projects of Shaanxi Province under Grant 2016KW-038.","","26","12","12","3","17","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2018","6","","","","","","12336","12341","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2787563","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2787563","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","GA8KH","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000428588500001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We find that the 1-min return distribution is fat tailed, and kurtosis largely deviates from the Gaussian expectation. Although for large sampling periods, kurtosis is anticipated to approach the Gaussian expectation, we find that convergence to that is very slow. Skewness is found to be negative at time scales shorter than one day and becomes consistent with zero at time scales longer than about one week. We also investigate daily volatility-asymmetry by using GARCH, GJR, and RGARCH models, and find no evidence of it. On exploring multifractality using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis, we find that the Bitcoin time series exhibits multifractality. The sources of multifractality are investigated, confirming that both temporal correlation and the fat-tailed distribution contribute to it. The influence of Brexit on June 23, 2016 to GBP-USD exchange rate and Bitcoin is examined in multifractal properties. We find that, while Brexit influenced the GBP-USD exchange rate, Bitcoin was robust to Brexit. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

One of the typical scams that operate on Bitcoin are the so-called Ponzi schemes. These are fraudulent investments which repay users with the funds invested by new users that join the scheme, and implode when it is no longer possible to find new investments. Despite being illegal in many countries, Ponzi schemes are now proliferating on Bitcoin, and they keep alluring new victims, who are plundered of millions of dollars. We apply data mining techniques to detect Bitcoin addresses related to Ponzi schemes. Our starting point is a dataset of features of real-world Ponzi schemes, that we construct by analysing, on the Bitcoin blockchain, the transactions used to perform the scams. We use this dataset to experiment with various machine learning algorithms, and we assess their effectiveness through standard validation protocols and performance metrics. The best of the classifiers we have experimented can identify most of the Ponzi schemes in the dataset, with a low number of false positives.","[Bartoletti, Massimo; Pes, Barbara; Serusi, Sergio] Univ Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy","University of Cagliari","Bartoletti, M (corresponding author), Univ Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.","bart@unica.it; pes@unica.it; sergio.serusi@unica.it","","","Aut.

The analysis of cryptocurrency Bitcoin within currency relations framework is subject for next chapter. Each commodity, which has a role of money, must fulfil three criteria. This commodity must be convertible, relative stable and liquid. This paper discusses the evaluation of these aspects.

However, beside its advantages consisting in secured, cheaper and faster transactions, borderless use, anonymity of the participants and lack of inflation, which makes it attractive for many people, Bitcoin also generates significant threats not only towards banks and economy, in general, but also to the society. Its private nature, beyond the supervision of any authority and especially the anonymity ensured for the participants in transactions with Bitcoin opens possibilities of using it in money laundering and terrorism activities, but also for speculative attacks on traditional currencies. Moreover, intermediating the sales of goods and services it interferes with traditional payment systems and may affect the monetary policies of governments from all over the world, including European Union countries. Therefore, debating on the issue of finding ways to regulate the use of Bitcoin in order to prevent such threats become justified and led us to the conclusion that beyond the need of regulations to be created by each country, because of its borderless use, there needed also regulatory measures to be taken on global scale by institutions like IMF or European Commission. Moreover, because of its dual nature, for regulating Bitcoin there is a need to combine the legislation applicable to traditional currencies with the one applicable to financial assets.","[Filip, Bogdan Florin] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania","Alexandru Ioan Cuza University","Filip, BF (corresponding author), Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.","bogdan.filip@feaa.uaic.ro","Filip, Bogdan Florin/AAG-6091-2021","","","","","","21","0","0","0","6","EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI","IASI","STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA","","","978-606-714-492-5","","","","2018","","","","","","","147","163","","","","","","17","Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Area Studies; Business & Economics","BL8FU","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000456271700010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Stakeholders use imaginaries to negotiate their differences and identify shared visions. The ways in which these stakeholders negotiate these differences to agree on concrete artifacts and practices is known as crystallization. However, the CSCW literature has not studied crystallization in detail. Our case study examines imaginaries and crystallization within the infrastructuring of Bitcoin, an open source digital currency and payment platform that is the first of emerging forms of peer-to-peer computer networks facilitating digital transactions. We conducted participant observation of two Bitcoin conferences held in December 2015. Each conference lasted between two to three days, amounting to 40 hours of observation. In these conferences, we examined Bitcoin infrastructuring taking place across different contexts, including open source development and startup communities. Each of these contexts contains pre-existing infrastructures along with powerful gatekeepers (e.g., software committers and financial regulators) who maintain its system of practices and artifacts. The Bitcoin actors, including open source developers and entrepreneurs, make use of imaginaries to identify differences among them, negotiate, and reach points of crystallization in order to integrate with these infrastructures. Based on these findings, we contribute the concept of imaginaries branching and discuss roles of imaginaries in an expansive infrastructuring work interacting with multiple installed bases, some of which also introduce practical limits to the imagined information system.","[Kow, Yong Ming] City Univ Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lustig, Caitlin] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA USA","City University of Hong Kong; University of California System; University of California Irvine","Kow, YM (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","yongmkow@cityu.edu.hk; clustig@uci.edu","","","City University of Hong Kong [7004760]","City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong)","The work described in this paper was partially supported by grants from City University of Hong Kong (Project No. 7004760).","","45","3","3","2","46","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0925-9724","1573-7551","","COMPUT SUPP COOP W J","Comput.

Bitcoin transactions are written by using a scripting language. The hash value of a transaction's script is used to identify the transaction over the network. In February 2014, a Bitcoin exchange company, Mt. Gox, claimed that they had lost hundreds of millions US dollars worth of Bitcoins in an attack known as transaction malleability. Although known about since 2011, this was the first known attack that resulted in a company loosing multi-millions of US dollars in Bitcoins. Our reason for writing this paper is to understand Bitcoin transaction malleability and to propose an efficient solution. Our solution is a softfork (i.e., it can be gradually implemented). Towards the end of the paper we present a detailed analysis of our scheme with respect to various transaction malleability-based attack scenarios to show that our simple solution can prevent future incidents involving transaction malleability from occurring. We compare our scheme with existing approaches and present an analysis regarding the computational cost and storage requirements of our proposed solution, which shows the feasibility of our proposed scheme.","[Rajput, Ubaidullah; Abbas, Fizza] Quaid E Awam UEST, Dept Comp Syst Engn, Nawabshah, Pakistan; [Oh, Heekuck] Hanyang Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, ERICA Campus, Ansan, South Korea","Hanyang University","Oh, H (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, ERICA Campus, Ansan, South Korea.","ubaidullah@quest.edu.pk; fizza_alvi@quest.edu.pk; hkoh@hanyang.ac.kr","","","Korea National Research Foundation (NRF) - Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology MEST [NRF-2015R1D1A1A09058200]; MSIT(Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea under ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) [IITP-2018-2014-1-00636]","Korea National Research Foundation (NRF) - Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology MEST; MSIT(Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea under ITRC (Information Technology Research Center)","This work was supported by the Korea National Research Foundation (NRF) grant that is funded by the Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology MEST (No. NRF-2015R1D1A1A09058200).; This research was supported by the MSIT(Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program (IITP-2018-2014-1-00636) supervised by the IITP (Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion).","","17","8","10","0","6","KOREA INFORMATION PROCESSING SOC","SEOUL","1002HO YONGSUNGBIZTEL 314-1 2GA HANKANGRO YONGSAN-GU, SEOUL, 140-750, SOUTH KOREA","1976-913X","2092-805X","","J INF PROCESS SYST","J.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and a decentralized worldwide payment system for digital currency where transactions take place among users without any intermediary. Bitcoin transactions are performed and verified by network nodes and then registered in a public ledger called blockchain, which is maintained by network entities running Bitcoin software. To date, this cryptocurrency is worth close to U.S. $150 billion and widely traded across the world. However, as Bitcoin's popularity grows, many security concerns are coming to the forefront. Overall, Bitcoin security inevitably depends upon the distributed protocols-based stimulant-compatible proof-of-work that is being run by network entities called miners, who are anticipated to primarily maintain the blockchain (ledger). As a result, many researchers are exploring new threats to the entire system, introducing new countermeasures, and therefore anticipating new security trends. In this survey paper, we conduct an intensive study that explores key security concerns. We first start by presenting a global overview of the Bitcoin protocol as well as its major components. Next, we detail the existing threats and weaknesses of the Bitcoin system and its main technologies including the blockchain protocol.

To do so, the functionalities, potentialities and limitations of the blockchain, technology underlying the cryptocurrency, are introduced. Afterwards, relevant aspects of the National Financial System are highlighted. Next, the article seeks the most appropriate legal conceptual classification for Bitcoin.

The collaborative contribution of its online software development community gradually shaped the functionality and performance of Bitcoin. To date, most discussions around Bitcoin are from technologies underlying the product, as well as market applications. There are very few studies on the development and evolution processes of the Bitcoin software. It is important to investigate on such developmental issues, in order to better understand the development methodologies and lessons learnt from such a spearheaded Blockchain system. This paper serves this purpose by examining the issues data extracted from the Bitcoin GitHub repository from 2011 to 2018. It reports the trends of the major development issues from a longitude perspective. The main results include: 1) the average lifespan of an issue in Bitcoin issue repository is approximately 57 days; and 2) the Top-7 issue types including refactoring, tests, doe, RPC.REST.ZMQ, GUI, bugs, and wallet, accounting for 64.3% of all issues; 3) topic modeling techniques are beneficial in mining popularity and evolution of key issue topics and most problematic architecture components.

Many people invest money on creating new Bitcoins because of Bitcoin's market increase. They actually buy hardware and power to participate in Bitcoin mining. The market value of Bitcoin has also absorbed cybercriminals. They steal the process cycles from victims' machines and use them in mining activities by malware programs. There have been several security reports about these types of malicious activities. Although there are methods to detect botnets, to the best of our knowledge, none of non-commercial and published papers present detection method for these types. In this paper, we present Botcointrap, a novel approach to identify Bitcoin miner botnets (called Botcoin) based on dynamic analysis of executable binary files. This method benefits from a parameter value that all Botcoins must use across their computations and detect them in the lowest level of execution; therefore, our method can be used to overcome weaknesses of many other approaches. Our evaluation shows that the proposed approach efficiently identifies all simulated Botcoins.","[Zareh, Atefeh; Shahriari, Hamid Reza] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Comp Engn & Informat Technol, Tehran, Iran","Amirkabir University of Technology","Zareh, A (corresponding author), Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Comp Engn & Informat Technol, Tehran, Iran.","zareh@aut.ac.ir; shahriari@aut.ac.ir","","","","","","","14","0","0","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2475-2363","","978-1-5386-7582-3","INT ISC CONF INFO SE","","","2018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO5AX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000516617000004","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this paper, we present ZombieCoin, a botnet command-and-control (C&C) mechanism that leverages the Bitcoin network. ZombieCoin offers considerable advantages over existing C&C techniques, most notably the fact that Bitcoin is designed to resist the very same takedown campaigns and regulatory processes that are the most often-used methods to combat botnets today. Furthermore, we describe how the Bitcoin network enables novel C&C techniques, which dramatically expand the scope of this threat, including the possibilities of flexible rendezvous scheduling, efficient botnet partitioning, and fine-grained control over bots. We validate our claims by implementing ZombieCoin bots which we then deploy and successfully control over the Bitcoin network. Our findings lead us to believe that Bitcoin-based C&C mechanisms are a highly desirable option that botmasters will pursue in the near future.

"J","Ram, AJ","","","","Ram, Asheer Jaywant","","","Taxation of the Bitcoin: initial insights through a correspondence analysis","MEDITARI ACCOUNTANCY RESEARCH","","","English","Article","","","","","","Taxation; Correspondence analysis; Bitcoin; Mixed method; Cryptocurrency","CAPITAL GAINS TAX; SOUTH-AFRICA; ECONOMICS; FAIRNESS; SYSTEM","Purpose - The Bitcoin has experienced wide popularity in academic and commercial spheres during the years following 2012. Research has been conducted in respect of information technology, finance and reporting paradigms, but there has been little research into the taxation of the Bitcoin. The purpose of this paper is to present a conceptual approach for developing a taxation policy for the Bitcoin, using a multi-jurisdictional analysis. Design/methodology/approach - An interpretive mixed-method approach is followed. The traits of the Bitcoin are determined through a review of the literature, followed by the determination of key taxation themes using a multi-jurisdictional view where the jurisdictions were determined using the largest Bitcoin exchanges. These form the row and column headings of the correspondence table research instrument, respectively. The correspondence table was completed by 40 tax experts. Correspondence analysis (a multivariate statistical technique) was then used to determine correlations between the Bitcoin traits and taxation themes, further used to present initial insights into developing a taxation policy for the Bitcoin. Findings - The correspondence analysis reveals that, contrary to current tax laws, the manner of acquisition as opposed to the reason (intention) for acquisition is key in determining how the Bitcoin is to be taxed. For taxing purposes, Bitcoin is seen as being distinct from currency, given that transactions with the Bitcoin are seen as barter transactions. Finally, because of the unique characteristics of the Bitcoin, it is shown that exchanges and the Bitcoin need to be regulated in the same manner as a currency. Research limitations/implications - This research focuses on income tax including capital gains tax and consumption taxes and was conducted with a sample of purposefully selected South African tax experts, given that the Bitcoin is experiencing enhanced popularity in South Africa. As a result, this research does not provide generalisable positivist conclusions and does not purport to represent the views of all tax practitioners. This paper does, however, provide an initial mechanism to develop taxation treatments for transactions not covered by existing legislation. Originality/value - This paper is the first to provide normative recommendations on the taxation of the Bitcoin. Using correspondence analysis, this paper offers an innovative approach for developing taxation policies when a transaction is not specifically included in the extant legislation. Further value is added through the use of a third dimension in the correspondence analysis which enhances the exploratory potential of the research.","[Ram, Asheer Jaywant] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Accountancy, Johannesburg, South Africa","University of Witwatersrand","Ram, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Accountancy, Johannesburg, South Africa.","Asheer.Ram@wits.ac.za","Ram, Asheer Jaywant/AAT-7966-2021","Ram, Asheer Jaywant/0000-0002-8212-2487","","","","","86","9","10","1","32","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","2049-372X","2049-3738","","MEDITARI ACCOUNT RES","Meditari Account.

However, anonymity is less secure than it is believed to be because it is based on using pseudonyms for addresses. To demonstrate this weakness, we used statistics related to transaction histories and the frequency of transactions to deanonymize a set of bitcoin addresses. In this paper, we explore the fundamental properties of Bitcoin addresses based on actual Bitcoin transaction data. We propose a new method for deanonymizing Bitcoin addresses from a set of output addresses and we demonstrate that 80.5% of addresses could be identified.","[Nagata, Kodai] Meiji Univ, Grad Sch Adv Math Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Kikuchi, Hiroaki] Meiji Univ, Sch Interdisciplinary Math Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Fan, Chun-I] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kaohsiung, Taiwan","Meiji University; Meiji University; National Sun Yat Sen University","Nagata, K (corresponding author), Meiji Univ, Grad Sch Adv Math Sci, Tokyo, Japan.","","","","","","","","6","2","2","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-5790-4","","","","2018","","","","","","","349","354","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BM3FW","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000462054900045","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We study the risk that investors face from the closure of Bitcoin exchanges, which convert between Bitcoins and hard currency. We examine the track record of 80 Bitcoin exchanges established between 2010 and 2015. We find that nearly half (38) have since closed, with customer account balances sometimes wiped out. Fraudsters are sometimes to blame, but not always. Twenty-five exchanges suffered security breaches, 15 of which subsequently closed. We present logistic regressions using longitudinal data on Bitcoin exchanges aggregated quarterly. We find that experiencing a breach is correlated with a 13 times greater odds that an exchange will close in that same quarter. We find that higher-volume exchanges are less likely to close (each doubling in trade volume corresponds to a 12% decrease in the odds of closure). We also find that exchanges that derive most of their business from trading less popular (fiat) currencies, which are offered by at most one competitor, are less likely to close.","[Moore, Tyler] Univ Tulsa, Tandy Sch Comp Sci, 800 South Tucker Dr, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA; [Christin, Nicolas; Szurdi, Janos] Carnegie Mellon Univ, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","University of Tulsa; Carnegie Mellon University","Moore, T (corresponding author), Univ Tulsa, Tandy Sch Comp Sci, 800 South Tucker Dr, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA.","tyler-moore@utulsa.edu; nicolasc@cmu.edu; jszurdi@cmu.edu","Christin, Nicolas/E-3038-2016","Christin, Nicolas/0000-0002-2506-8031","National Science Foundation under ITR award [CCF-0424422]; Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate, Cyber Security Division (DHSS&T/CSD) Broad Agency Announcement 11.02, the Government of Australia; SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific [N66001-13-C-0131]","National Science Foundation under ITR award; Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate, Cyber Security Division (DHSS&T/CSD) Broad Agency Announcement 11.02, the Government of Australia; SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific","This article is a thoroughly expanded and revised version of a short paper that appeared at the 2013 International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security (Moore and Christin 2013).

Recent works, however, show how users can be reidentified and their payments linked based on Bitcoin's most central element, the blockchain, a public ledger of all transactions. Thus, many regard Bitcoin's central promise of financial privacy as broken. In this paper, we propose CoinParty, an efficient decentralized mixing service that allows users to reestablish their financial privacy in Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies. CoinParty, through a novel combination of decryption mixnets with threshold signatures, takes a unique place in the design space of mixing services, combining the advantages of previously proposed centralized and decentralized mixing services in one system. Our prototype implementation of CoinParty scales to large numbers of users and achieves anonymity sets by orders of magnitude higher than related work as we quantify by analyzing transactions in the actual Bitcoin blockchain. CoinParty can easily be deployed by any individual group of users, i.e., independent of any third parties, or provided as a commercial or voluntary service, e.g., as a community service by privacy-aware organizations.

However, this reliance has proven to be high risk, since Bitcoin and other blockchain-based transactions are not easily reversible. Many of the attacks have shown that the traditional intrusion detection system is not enough to safeguard against all possible attacks, and most importantly, in some cases, it takes a long time to assess the damage. In this paper, we first describe three types of intrusion models in Bitcoin exchanges and propose a detection and mitigation system using blockchain analysis for each. The proposed detection and mitigation system exploit the decentralized and public nature of Bitcoin blockchain to complement the existing traditional intrusion detection system as a fail-safe. The proposed method provides real-time intrusion detection capability that the existing work cannot provide.

During both periods, the USD-BTC exchange rate rose by an average of four percent on days when suspicious trades took place, compared to a slight decline on days without suspicious activity. Based on rigorous analysis with extensive robustness checks, the paper demonstrates that the suspicious trading activity likely caused the unprecedented spike in the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013, when the rate jumped from around $150 to more than $1,000 in two months.

This paper investigates the implications of replacing gold in an investment portfolio with bitcoin (digital gold). Our approach is to use several different multivariate GARCH models (dynamic conditional correlation (DCC), asymmetric DCC (ADCC), generalized orthogonal GARCH (GO-GARCH)) to estimate minimum variance equity portfolios.

Notably, Bitcoin has become popular since it maintains the anonymity of the users and enables peer-to-peer instant payments across the world. It is a decentralized money transfer protocol that does transactions without exposing user credentials and does verifications without any third-party intervention. Though it maintains anonymity, decentralization concept introduced vulnerabilities leading to severe security issues like double spending, block withholding and 51% attacks. These issues necessitate security specific enhancements in Bitcoin protocol. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of incorporating criteria check for miners to participate in mining process and a verification process to join the mining pool. The proposed idea mitigates double spending, block withholding, and 51% attacks. Further, a new approach is proposed namely, refining block creation and verification strategy for improving transaction rate without compromising security.","[Bala, R.; Manoharan, R.] Pondicherry Engn Coll, Pondicherry, India","Pondicherry Engineering College","Bala, R (corresponding author), Pondicherry Engn Coll, Pondicherry, India.","balasekar.bs@pec.edu; rmanoharan@pec.edu","","","","","","","12","0","0","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-3624-4","","","","2018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BM7CP","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000467740000038","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This premise of a free decentralized transactional network however requires, in its current implementation, unrestricted access to the ledger for peer-based transaction verification. A number of studies have shown that, in this pseudonymous context, identities can be leaked based on transaction features or off-network information. In this work, we analyze the information revealed by the pattern of transactions in the neighborhood of a given entity transaction. By definition, these features which pertain to an extended network are not directly controllable by the entity, but might enable leakage of information about transacting entities. We define a number of new features relevant to entity characterization on the Bitcoin Blockchain and study their efficacy in practice. We show that even a weak attacker with shallow data mining knowledge is able to leverage these features to characterize the entity properties.","[Jourdan, Marc; Blandin, Sebastien; Wynter, Laura; Deshpande, Pralhad] IBM Res, 10 Marina Blvd, Singapore 18983, Singapore","","Jourdan, M (corresponding author), IBM Res, 10 Marina Blvd, Singapore 18983, Singapore.","mjourdan@sg.ibm.com; sblandin@sg.ibm.com; lwynter@sg.ibm.com; pralhad@sg.ibm.com","","JOURDAN, Marc/0000-0002-2449-4549","","","","","27","29","30","0","12","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2375-9232","","978-1-5386-9288-2","INT CONF DAT MIN WOR","","","2018","","","","","","","55","62","","10.1109/ICDMW.2018.00016","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2018.00016","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BM5YT","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000465766800009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Here, we describe Niji, a new cross-chain payment protocol that allows parties to perform Bitcoin payment securely on a consortium chain, without any trusted third-party or mediator. Niji introduces templatization of a transaction to validate Bitcoin payments efficiently on different consortium blockchains. The process from payment to service provision runs autonomously without any interaction between parties.

In Bitcoin blockchain, miners provide computational services (i.e. mining) to get profits from the fixed rewards of newly found block and also transaction fees from recording the users' transactions to the blocks. With the decreasing of the fixed new block reward, transaction fees will play the role as the main profit source of miners, thus provide important supports for the sustainability and vitality of the Bitcoin system. Therefore, it is of great necessity to research transaction fees. In this paper, we investigate transaction fees in a queuing game with non-preemptive priority, in which both the miners' mining rewards and the users' time cost are highlighted. Then, we conduct theoretical analysis of the game, getting five types of Nash equilibria of the game. We also find that the over-long waiting time will bring negative marginal profits on transaction fees to some users with low time cost, therefore, they will not be willing to offer transaction fees.","[Li, Juanjuan; Yuan, Yong; Wang, Shuai; Wang, Fei-Yue] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, State Key Lab Management & Control Complex Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Juanjuan; Yuan, Yong] Qingdao Acad Intelligent Ind, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shuai] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fei-Yue] Natl Univ Def Technol, Res Ctr Mil Computat Expt & Parallel Syst, Changsha, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Automation, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; National University of Defense Technology - China","Yuan, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, State Key Lab Management & Control Complex Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Yuan, Y (corresponding author), Qingdao Acad Intelligent Ind, Qingdao, Peoples R China.","juanjuan.li@ia.ac.cn; yong.yuan@ia.ac.cn; wangshuai2015@ia.ac.cn; feiyue.wang@ia.ac.cn","Yuan, Yuan/GVS-5120-2022","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71472174, 61533019, 71702182]; Early Career Development Award of SKLMCCS [Y6S9011F4E, Y6S9011F4H, Y6S9011F52]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Early Career Development Award of SKLMCCS","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (#71472174, #61533019, #71702182) and the Early Career Development Award of SKLMCCS (#Y6S9011F4E, #Y6S9011F4H, #Y6S9011F52)","","24","14","15","1","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1931-0587","","978-1-5386-4452-2","IEEE INT VEH SYM","","","2018","","","","","","","114","119","","","","","","6","Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Robotics; Transportation Science & Technology","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Robotics; Transportation","BS4IK","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000719424500020","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We find that trading through the Bitcoin market produces higher transaction costs or requires higher risk compensation than trading through the conventional exchange market. Then, we explore the Venezuelan case. Comparing the estimates of the black market bolivars, which are generated from several popular media sources and the Web site Dolartoday.com, using Bitcoin can produce reliable bolivar exchange rates quickly and easily.

We utilize a Bayesian change point model to detect structural breaks and to partition the time series into segments. We find that structural breaks in average returns and volatility of Bitcoin are very frequent. By merging segments with similar properties into regimes we identify several regimes with positive average returns and one regime with negative average returns. Across regimes, higher volatility is associated with higher average returns, with exception of the most volatile regime, which is the only regime with negative average returns.","[Thies, Sven] Univ Bremen, Fac Business Studies & Econ, Bremen, Germany; [Molnar, Peter] Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, Stavanger, Norway; [Molnar, Peter] Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting Prague, Prague, Czech Republic","University of Bremen; Universitetet i Stavanger; Prague University of Economics & Business","Molnar, P (corresponding author), Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, Stavanger, Norway.;Molnar, P (corresponding author), Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.","peter.molnar@uis.no","Molnar, Peter/I-5426-2019","Molnar, Peter/0000-0003-1354-0113","","","","","21","48","49","0","18","ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE","SAN DIEGO","525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","1544-6123","1544-6131","","FINANC RES LETT","Financ.

To thwart such attacks, several Bitcoin mixers have been proposed, with the objective of providing unlinkability between payers and payees. However, existing Bitcoin mixers can be regarded as either insecure or inefficient. We present OBSCURO, a highly efficient and secure Bitcoin mixer that utilizes trusted execution environments (TEEs). With the TEE's confidentiality and integrity guarantees for code and data, our mixer design ensures the correct mixing operations and the protection of sensitive data (i.e., private keys and mixing logs), ruling out coin theft and address linking attacks by a malicious service provider. Yet, the TEE-based implementation does not prevent the manipulation of inputs (e.g., deposit submissions, blockchain feeds) to the mixer, hence OBSCURO is designed to overcome such limitations: it (1) offers an indirect deposit mechanism to prevent a malicious service provider from rejecting benign user deposits; and (2) scrutinizes blockchain feeds to prevent deposits from being mixed more than once (thus degrading anonymity) while being eclipsed from the main blockchain branch. In addition, OBSCURO provides several unique anonymity features (e.g., minimum mixing set size guarantee, resistant to dropping user deposits) that are not available in existing centralized and decentralized mixers. Our prototype of OBSCURO is built using Intel SGX and we demonstrate its effectiveness in Bitcoin Testnet. Our implementation mixes 1000 inputs in just 6.49 seconds, which vastly outperforms all of the existing decentralized mixers.","[Tran, Muoi; Kang, Min Suk; Saxena, Prateek] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Luu, Loi] Kyber Network, Singapore, Singapore; [Bentov, Iddo] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","National University of Singapore; Cornell University","Tran, M (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.","muoitran@comp.nus.edu.sg; loiluu@kyber.network; kangms@comp.nus.edu.sg; iddobentov@cornell.edu; prateeks@comp.nus.edu.sg","","Tran, Muoi/0000-0002-6049-5688","Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund [R-252-000-624-133]; National Science Foundation [CNS-1617676]","Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund(Ministry of Education, Singapore); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We thank the anonymous reviewers of this paper for their helpful feedback.

Therefore, it is necessary to hide some of the transaction information in the public data. This paper presents a Bitcoin transaction information hiding algorithm based on HEVC without intra-frame distortion drift. We embed the specified transaction data into the three-tuple of the 4 x 4 luminance DST blocks which meet our conditions to avert the distortion drift. With the cross using of multiple three-tuple, the visual quality of the embedded video had a better promotion than using single three-tuple.

In this paper, our goal is to explore the notion of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) to propose an augmented Bitcoin protocol that can scale gracefully. Our proposal aims to increase the transaction throughput by partitioning the UTXO space and splitting the block chain. In addition, a new type of Bitcoin node is introduced to preserve the capability to run validating nodes in low-bandwidth environments, despite the increased transaction throughput.","[Ozyilmaz, Kazim Rifat] Bogazici Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Istanbul, Turkey","Bogazici University","Ozyilmaz, KR (corresponding author), Bogazici Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Istanbul, Turkey.","kazim@monolytic.com; reach@harshpatel.space; ankit@ankitmalik.in","Özyılmaz, Kazım Rıfat/AAG-9469-2019","","","","","","16","5","6","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2327-0594","","978-1-5386-6565-7","INT CONF SOFTW ENG","","","2018","","","","","","","41","45","","","","","","5","Computer Science, Software Engineering","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BM6QK","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000467282900009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

On the other hand, this currency is hardly mineable at the moment, since it is a very energy-consuming procedure. Litecoin is a cryptocurrency which has the following advantages: it is much faster to mine than Bitcoin. One block of Litecoin takes up just 2.5 minutes of hashing in comparison to 10 minutes necessary for hashing a block of Bitcoin. Thus, Litecoin transactions are faster to process and confirm.

Our empirical findings signify the existence of long-range memory in Bitcoin market volatility, irrespectively of distributional inference. The same applies to entropy measurement, which indicates a high degree of randomness in the estimated series.

We aim to ascertain the magnitude and robustness of diversification gains for an already diversified portfolio due to inclusion of Bitcoin from the standpoint of an Indian investor. We use eight indices to build a portfolio spread across six asset classes, namely, equity, fixed income, commodities, real estate, gold and alternative investments. All asset classes except alternative investments are represented by indices which track performance of respective assets in India. We employ three investment strategies, namely, 'long only', 'constrained' and 'equally weighted' to construct optimal portfolios. Instead of the traditional mean-variance optimization methodology, we apply mean-CVaR approach for optimal allocation of weights to assets. Our findings suggest that portfolios containing Bitcoin have superior risk-adjusted returns as compared to portfolios without Bitcoin for two strategies, 'long only' and 'equally weighted'. Results suggest relatively stable weights across the investment horizon for Bitcoin in 'long only' strategy as compared to 'constrained' framework. The findings are relevant for institutional and retail investors looking to earn higher risk-adjusted returns for a portfolio denominated in Indian rupee. The study highlights the immense potential of Bitcoin as an investment alternative and also adds fresh evidence to the scarce literature on Bitcoin from a financial perspective.","[Aggarwal, Shivani; Santosh, Mayank] Delhi Technol Univ, Delhi, India; [Bedi, Prateek] Univ Delhi, Dept Financial Studies, Delhi, India","Delhi Technological University; University of Delhi","Bedi, P (corresponding author), Univ Delhi, Dept Financial Studies, Delhi, India.","shivani_bt2k14@dtu.ac.in; mayanksantosh_bt2k14@dtu.ac.in","","","","","","","30","8","8","0","2","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","2522-5006","2522-5014","978-3-319-78378-9; 978-3-319-78377-2","ADV THE PRA EMER MAR","","","2018","","","","","","","99","115","","10.1007/978-3-319-78378-9_6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-78378-9_6","10.1007/978-3-319-78378-9","","17","Business; Development Studies","Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH)","Business & Economics; Development Studies","BP1BP","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000538736100007","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Cybercriminals exploit these characteristics to commit immutable and presumably untraceable monetary fraud, especially via ransomware; a type of malware that encrypts files of the infected system and demands ransom for decryption. In this paper, we present our comprehensive study on all recent ransomware and report the economic impact of such ransomware from the Bitcoin payment perspective. We also present a lightweight framework to identify, collect, and analyze Bitcoin addresses managed by the same user or group of users (cybercriminals, in this case), which includes a novel approach for classifying a payment as ransom. To verify the correctness of our framework, we compared our findings on CryptoLocker ransomware with the results presented in the literature. Our results align with the results found in the previous works except for the final valuation in USD. The reason for this discrepancy is that we used the average Bitcoin price on the day of each ransom payment whereas the authors of the previous studies used the Bitcoin price on the day of their evaluation. Furthermore, for each investigated ransomware, we provide a holistic view of its genesis, development, the process of infection and execution, and characteristic of ransom demands. Finally, we also release our dataset that contains a detailed transaction history of all the Bitcoin addresses we identified for each ransomware. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Jumps to volatility are permanent, while jumps to mean returns have contemporaneous effects only. Results point to two high volatility periods: the first from late 2013 to early 2014, likely associated to the Mt.

Therefore, de-mixing algorithms are needed to identify illegal financial flows and to reduce criminal activity. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, few studies on analyzing mixing services and de-anonymizing transactions have been proposed. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of real-world mixing services, and propose a de-mixing algorithm for Helix, one of the most widely used Bitcoin mixing services. The proposed algorithm de-anonymizes the relationship between the input and output addresses of mixing services by exploiting the static and dynamic parameters of mixing services.

The performance of the proposed models are evaluated using daily bitcoin price data during 2018/1/1 to 2018/7/28 in total 208 records. The results confirmed the excellent forecasting accuracy of the proposed model with AR(2).

To increase its transaction rate and speed, micropayment channel networks have been proposed; however, these require to lock funds into specific channels. Moreover, the available space in the blockchain does not allow scaling to a worldwide payment system. We propose a new layer that sits in between the blockchain and the payment channels. The new layer addresses the scalability problem by enabling trustless off-blockchain channel funding. It consists of shared accounts of groups of nodes that flexibly create one-to-one channels for the payment network. The new system allows rapid changes of the allocation of funds to channels and reduces the cost of opening new channels. Instead of one blockchain transaction per channel, each user only needs one transaction to enter a group of nodes-within the group the user can create arbitrarily many channels. For a group of 20 users with 100 intra-group channels, the cost of the blockchain transactions is reduced by 90% compared to 100 regular micropayment channels opened on the blockchain. This can be increased further to 96% if Bitcoin introduces Schnorr signatures with signature aggregation.","[Burchert, Conrad; Wattenhofer, Roger] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Decker, Christian] Blockstream Inc, San Francisco, CA USA","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich","Burchert, C (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.","bconrad@ethz.ch","","Decker, Christian/0000-0002-8998-3570","","","","","30","27","29","0","19","ROYAL SOC","LONDON","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","2054-5703","","","ROY SOC OPEN SCI","R.

We apply the generalized sup Augmented Dickey-Fuller test method proposed by Phillips et al. (2013). The results show that there have been four explosive bubbles in China and the U.S. market, primarily occurring during the periods of huge surges in Bitcoin prices. This is consistent with the bubble model improved by Gurkaynak (2008), in which asset price is decomposed into fundamental and bubble components. In particular, exogenous shocks, including foreign or domestic economic events, lead to the origination of bubbles. A serious financial crisis may trigger long-term and large-scale bubbles, whereas relatively short-term bubbles are caused by domestic components. It can be inferred that Bitcoin can be used as a hedge against market-specific risk. Finally, Bitcoin bubbles collapse due to administrative intervention by economic authorities. Therefore, the government should manage public expectations to maintain confidence in authority and reduce speculation behavior to stabilize the asset price and financial market.

Firstly, we analyze and compare conditional variance properties of Bitcoin and Gold as well as other assets and find differences in their structure. Secondly, we implement a BEKK-GARCH model to estimate time-varying conditional correlations. Gold plays an important role in financial markets with flight-to-quality in times of market distress. Our results show that Bitcoin behaves as the exact opposite and it positively correlates with downward markets. Lastly, we analyze the properties of Bitcoin as portfolio component and find no evidence for stable hedging capabilities.

Such systems allow public read/ write access to an append-only blockchain database without the need for any mediating central authority. Instead, they guarantee access, security and protocol conformity through an elegant combination of cryptographic assurances and game theoretic economic incentives. Not until the advent of the Bitcoin blockchain has such a trusted, transparent, comprehensive and granular dataset of digital economic behaviours been available for public network analysis. In this article, by translating the cumbersome binary data structure of the Bitcoin blockchain into a high fidelity graph model, we demonstrate through various analyses the often overlooked social and econometric benefits of employing such a novel open data architecture. Specifically, we show: (i) how repeated patterns of transaction behaviours can be revealed to link user activity across the blockchain; (ii) how newly mined bitcoin can be associated to demonstrate individual accumulations of wealth; (iii) through application of the naive quantity theory of money that Bitcoin's disinflationary properties can be revealed and measured; and (iv) how the user community can develop coordinated defences against repeated denial of service attacks on the network. Such public analyses of this open data are exemplary benefits unavailable to the closed data models of the ` private permissioned' distributed ledger architectures currently dominating enterprise-level blockchain development owing to existing issues of scalability, confidentiality and governance.","[McGinn, D.; McIlwraith, D.; Guo, Y.] Imperial Coll London, Data Sci Inst, London, England","Imperial College London","McGinn, D (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Data Sci Inst, London, England.","d.mcginn@imperial.ac.uk","","","","","","","14","17","19","2","43","ROYAL SOC","LONDON","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","2054-5703","","","ROY SOC OPEN SCI","R.

Since all transactions recorded on the blockchain are public to everyone, Bitcoin users face a threat of leaking financial privacy. Many analysis and deanonymization approaches have been proposed to link transaction records to real identities. To eliminate this threat, we present an unlinkable coin mixing scheme that allows users to mix their bitcoins without trusting a third party. This mixing scheme employs a primitive known as ring signature with elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) to conceal the transfer of coins between addresses. The mixing server is only able to check whether the output addresses belong to its customers, but it cannot tell which address owned by which customer. Customers do not have to rely on the reputation of a third party to ensure his money will be returned, and his privacy will not be leaked. This scheme needs no modifications on current Bitcoin system and is convenient to deploy by any communities. We implemented a prototype of our scheme and tested it under the Bitcoin core's regtest mode. Security and privacy of our mixing scheme are ensured through the standard ring signature and ECDSA unforgeability.","[Liu, Yi; Liu, Xingtong; Tang, Chaojing; Wang, Jian; Zhang, Lei] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Elect Sci, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China","National University of Defense Technology - China","Liu, XT (corresponding author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Elect Sci, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China.","liuxingtong@nudt.edu.cn","","Liu, Yi/0000-0002-1502-0499","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61601476, 61672527]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Project 61601476 and Project 61672527.","","41","30","31","1","36","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2018","6","","","","","","23261","23270","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2827163","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2827163","","","10","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","GG8FP","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000432933500001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It starts with the basic hypothesis that surveyed respondents would show a positive perception for using bitcoin currency in order to get much better satisfaction than by using traditional payment methods, given the very high costs of banking services in the observed countries due to a greater degree of security and privacy of payment transactions. Also, an auxiliary hypothesis has been defined, which reads: the establishment and faster expansion of bitcoin payments depends on the establishment of institutional infrastructure. The research conducted in the South Eastern Europe countries showed a high correlation between defined dependent variable and independent variable, i.e. a high degree of perception of meeting the needs and expectations of future users by considered bitcoin currency payment technology.","[Nikic, Vinko] Adriatic Univ Bar, Fac Metiterranean Business Studies Tivat, Ul Luke Tomanovica 1, Tivat 85320, Montenegro","","Nikic, V (corresponding author), Adriatic Univ Bar, Fac Metiterranean Business Studies Tivat, Ul Luke Tomanovica 1, Tivat 85320, Montenegro.","nikicv@t-com.me","","","","","","","20","1","1","1","9","VILNIUS UNIV","VILNIUS","UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA","1648-4460","","","TRANSFORM BUS ECON","Transform.

As a result, miners tend to join a large open pool to get a more stable reward. Nowadays, mining pools take up over 98% of Bitcoins total computation power. In a sense, this is a manifestation of Bitcoin that tends to be centralized. Thus, researchers have shown an increased interest in pool mining payoff and security. The purpose of this paper is to review and summarize recent research in Bitcoin pool mining system. We first introduce several common reward distribution schemes, and analyze their advantages and disadvantages with some improvement mechanisms; In the second section, to address pool security problems, we examined the practical utility of some existing and potential attack strategies. To study those malicious attack in details, several defense methods are collected. Finally, we make an outlook on Bitcoin future.","[Zhu, Saide; Li, Wei; Cai, Zhipeng] Georgia State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Li, Hong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hu, Chunqiang] Chongqing Univ, Sch Big Data & Software Engn, Chongqing, Peoples R China","University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Engineering, CAS; Chongqing University","Li, W (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.","szhu5@student.gsu.edu; w1i28@gsu.edu; lihong@iie.ac.cn; chu@cqu.edu.cn; zcai@gsu.edu","Cai, Zhipeng/AAJ-3290-2021; Hu, Chunqiang/X-1142-2019; Cai, Zhipeng/AAA-7659-2021","","NSF [1704287, 1252292, 1741277]; Science and Technology Innovation Seed Project of Sichuan Province [2017RZ0008]; International cooperation and exchange Project of Sichuan Province [2017HH0075]; Chinese Scholarship Council [20173109]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61702062]; Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, China [cstc2018jcyjAX0334]; Overseas Returnees Support Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship of Chongqing [cx2018015]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Science and Technology Innovation Seed Project of Sichuan Province; International cooperation and exchange Project of Sichuan Province; Chinese Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, China(Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing); Overseas Returnees Support Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship of Chongqing","This research work was partly supported by the NSF NOs. 1704287, 1252292, 1741277, Science and Technology Innovation Seed Project of Sichuan Province under grant No.(2017RZ0008), International cooperation and exchange Project of Sichuan Province under grant No.(2017HH0075), Chinese Scholarship Council under grant No.(20173109), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61702062), the Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, China (cstc2018jcyjAX0334), and Overseas Returnees Support Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship of Chongqing (cx2018015).","","51","6","7","3","9","AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS","SPRINGFIELD","PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA","","2577-8838","","MATH FDN COMPUT","Math.

The adopted methodology allows us to identify causal networks based on the measurements of observed correlations and partial correlations, without relying on a priori assumptions. Results from the contemporaneous analysis indicate that the Bitcoin market is quite isolated, and no specific asset plays a dominant role in influencing the Bitcoin market. However, we find evidence of lagged relationships between Bitcoin and some assets, especially during the bear market state of Bitcoin. This finding suggests that the integration between the Bitcoin and other financial assets is a continuous process that varies over time. We conduct forecast error variance decompositions and find that the influence of each of the other assets on Bitcoin over a 20-day horizon does not account for more than 11% of all innovations.

The complexity of financial markets has always presented challenging issues and provided interesting findings, such as the inverse cubic law in the tails of stock price fluctuation distributions. Motivated by the rise of novel digital assets based on blockchain technology, we study the distributions of cryptocurrency price fluctuations. We consider Bitcoin returns over various time intervals and from multiple digital exchanges, in order to investigate the existence of universal scaling behavior in the tails, and ascertain whether the scaling exponent supports the presence of a finite second moment. We provide empirical evidence on slowly decaying tails in the distributions of returns over multiple time intervals and different exchanges, corresponding to a power-law. We estimate the scaling exponent and find an asymptotic power-law behavior with 2 < alpha < 2.5 suggesting that Bitcoin returns, in addition to being more volatile, also exhibit heavier tails than stocks, which are known to be around 3. Our results also imply the existence of a finite second moment, thus providing a fundamental basis for the usage of standard financial theories and covariance-based techniques in risk management and portfolio optimization scenarios.

While bitcoins stored on online devices are continually vulnerable to malware and other network-based attacks, offline reserves are endangered on access, as transferring bitcoins requires the exposure of otherwise encrypted and secured private keys. In particular, fluctuations in customer demand for deposited bitcoin require exchanges to periodically refill online storage systems with bitcoins held offline. This raises the natural question of what upper limit on online reserves minimizes losses due to theft over time. In this article, we investigate this optimization problem, developing a model that predicts the optimal ceiling on online reserves, given average rates of deposits, withdrawals, and theft. We evaluate our theory with an event-driven simulation of the setup, and find that our equation yields a numerical value for the threshold that differs by less than 2% from experimental results. We conclude by considering open questions regardingmore complex storage architectures.","[Jain, Samvit; Felten, Edward; Goldfeder, Steven] Princeton Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Princeton University","Jain, S (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.","samvit@eecs.berkeley.edu","","","Department of Computer Science at Princeton University; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE 1148900]","Department of Computer Science at Princeton University; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF))","S.J. is supported in part by the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University.

Currently cryptocurrencies are rather tokens and a highly volatile asset class of their own.","[Haiss, Peter; Schmid-Schmidsfelden, Jakob] WU Univ Econ & Business, Dept Global Business & Trade, Inst Export Management, Welthandelspl 1,Bldg D1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria","","Haiss, P (corresponding author), WU Univ Econ & Business, Dept Global Business & Trade, Inst Export Management, Welthandelspl 1,Bldg D1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.","peter.haiss@wu.ac.at; jakob.schmidsfelden@gmx.at","","","","","","","34","2","2","0","1","MASARYKOVA UNIV","BRNO","ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC","","","978-80-210-8980-8","","","","2018","","","","","","","128","138","","","","","","11","Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Area Studies; Business & Economics","BM4AM","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000462948800016","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A delegator (D) outsources a computation to a worker (W), who expects to get paid in return for delivering correct outputs. The delegator has to verify the output returned, to guard against malicious or malfunctioning worker. The worker may not trust the delegator to pay for computations performed by him. Blockchain systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum offer public verifiability of transactions generated in their networks. These transactions are of the form of a set of opcodes in Bitcoins or initiate execution of a contract in Ethereum, thus offering execution of small programs publicly. A fair protocol for verifiable computation between two parties D and W must provide the following guarantee: (1) Fast verification: The work performed to verify the correctness of output of a function is less than the work performed to compute function. (2) Pay to learn output: W obtains pay from D iff D received the correct output of the computation from W. In this work, we design two ideal functionalities F*(CRR) for single worker case and F*(CCRR) for multiple workers case. Existing methods do not allow Mutual revocation of deposit transaction which reduces the cost of script execution. Our ideal functionalities offer mutual revocation of the deposit transaction made by D. We show the realization of our ideal functionality F*(CRR) in Bitcoin, and we also discuss fair protocols for verifiable computations of GCD of two large numbers and optimization problems. As our final work, we show a fair protocol for proofbased verifiable computing schemes.","[Reddy, Dorsala Mallikarjun; Sastry, V.

In Bitcoin, users do not use real names; instead, pseudonyms are used. Managing and verifying transactions and issuing of bitcoins are performed collectively by peers in the network. Since pseudonyms are used without providing any identity, it is perceived that Bitcoin provides anonymity. However, it is one of the most transparent payment networks since all transactions are publicly announced. Blockchain, which is the public ledger of Bitcoin, includes all transactions to prevent double-spending and to provide integrity. By using data in the blockchain, flow of bitcoins between transactions can be observed and activities of the users can be traced. When the implications obtained from the blockchain are combined with external data, identity and profile of a user can be revealed. This possibility has undesirable effects such as spending history of a user becomes accessible to other people, or cash flow of a merchant becomes exposed to competitors. There are several proposals as extensions or alternatives to Bitcoin, which improve anonymity and privacy. This survey presents an overview and detailed investigation of anonymity and privacy in Bitcoin-like digital cash systems. We examine the studies in the literature/Web in two major categories: 1) analyses of anonymity and privacy in Bitcoin and 2) extensions and alternatives to Bitcoin, which improve anonymity and privacy. We list and describe methods and outcomes for both categories and group studies according to these methods and outcomes. We also present relationships between outcomes of analyses and the improvement methods. We compare performances of the methods and show relationships between the proposals.

Due to this, the electronic payment systems that have started to be used since the second half of the 20th century in the world and the credit cards called plastic money have started to be widely used in our country since the 80 '. From the beginning of 2000's, it is observed that cash-based transactions are lagging e-money-based transactions. Since the beginning of the 90's the Internet and social media emerged with new media technologies and after 2004, it has become a dominant idea that these environments provide freedom and even create disorder. In the last 5-6 years we have seen the trade of crypto currencies like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a method of payment that people use for their purchases based on mutual trust, without an authority issuing it. It works independently of the state authority and the banking system. From this point of view, it is seen as the reflection of freedom originally envisaged for the internet environment. In this context, the question of how bitcoin systems are perceived, and the level of entrepreneurship are issues that needs to be investigated. In this study, a survey was conducted to measure the level of entrepreneurship of bitcoin miners, buyers and sellers. Twitter users were selected for the sample. The research is designed to examine the impact of entrepreneurship motivated by investors' interest in entering the arena that is said to be quite new and risky, and which sub-factors may dominate, which deals with bitcoin and similar crypto currencies. The findings show that users who are interested in mining, buying-selling and trading have very high level of entrepreneurial points.","[Sutcu, Cem Sefa; Aytekin, Cigdem] Marmara Univ, Istanbul, Turkey","Marmara University","Sutcu, CS (corresponding author), Marmara Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.","csutcu@marmara.edu.tr; cigdem.aytekin@marmara.edu.tr","Aytekin, Çiğdem/Q-8462-2019; SUTCU, CEM S/T-4083-2018","SUTCU, CEM S/0000-0002-9389-6832; Aytekin, Cigdem/0000-0002-1385-9864","","","","","23","2","2","1","13","ISTANBUL KULTUR UNIV","ISTANBUL","ATAKOY CAMPUS, BAKIRKOY, ISTANBUL, 34156, TURKEY","2146-5193","","","TURK ONLINE J DES AR","Turk.

To assess sustainability, we focus on the bitcoin miners as they play an important role in the proof-of-work consensus mechanism of bitcoin to create trust in the currency. Miners offer their services against a reward while recurring expenses. Our results show that bitcoin mining has become less profitable over time to the extent that profits seem to converge to zero. This is what economic theory predicts for a competitive market that has a single homogenous good. We analyze the actors involved in the bitcoin system as well as the value flows between these actors using the e(3)value methodology. The value flows are quantified using publicly available data about the bitcoin network. However, two important value flows for the miners, namely hardware investments and expenses for electricity power, are not available from public sources. Therefore, we contribute an approach to estimate the installed base of bitcoin hardware equipment over time. Using this estimate, we can calculate the expenses miner should have. At the end of our analysis period, the marginal profit of mining a bitcoin becomes negative, i.e., to a loss for the miners. This loss is caused by the consensus mechanism of the bitcoin protocol, which requires a substantial investment in hardware and significant recurring daily expenses for energy. Therefore, a sustainable crypto currency needs higher payments for miners or more energy efficient algorithms to achieve consensus in a network about the truth of the distributed ledger.","[Derks, Jona; Gordijn, Jaap] Vrije Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Siegmann, Arjen] Vrije Univ, Dept Finance, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam","Siegmann, A (corresponding author), Vrije Univ, Dept Finance, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.","a.h.siegmann@vu.nl","","Gordijn, Jaap/0000-0002-6401-3850; Siegmann, Arjen/0000-0002-0285-745X","","","","","35","19","18","2","18","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","1019-6781","1422-8890","","ELECTRON MARK","Electron.

Transaction security is secured in Bitcoin by using blocks with a hash-based Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism. Bitcoin PoW takes an average of 10-minutes to complete and 6 consecutive blocks are recommended for a single transaction in the system. PoW is a functional protocol that validates every incoming data to overcome spam attacks and DDoS attacks (Distributed Denial of Service). Selfish miner is an attack on the integrity of the Bitcoin network. The selfish miner succeeds because the honest miners are forced to spend part of their computing cycle on blocks that are destined not to be in the public chain. To achieve higher scalability, network latency must be low, that is the time required for the protocol to confirm the transaction should be effectively reduced. In this study, the author will make a simulation of the effect of latency on block receive time on Bitcoin with selfish-miner attack using NS3. The experimental results show the use of the latency variation and the more number of generated blocks, the lower the MBRT value. The average MBRT of each parameter shows the required receive time by the block number of about 15 minutes to 16 minutes. This amount exceeds the PoW's tolerance time limit when making a transaction. This is due of selfish-miner attack and Latency.","[Putri, Bellia Dwi Cahya; Sari, Riri Fitri] Univ Indonesia, Dept Elect Engn, Depok, Indonesia","University of Indonesia","Putri, BDC (corresponding author), Univ Indonesia, Dept Elect Engn, Depok, Indonesia.","bellia.dwi@ui.ac.id; riri@ui.ac.id","","","Shera USAID Grant Universitas Indonesia [140/UN2, R3.SC/HKP.05.01/2018]","Shera USAID Grant Universitas Indonesia","This paper is funded by Shera USAID Grant Universitas Indonesia - No 140/UN2.R3.SC/HKP.05.01/2018.","","10","4","4","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2372-7314","","978-1-5386-6940-2","INT C TELECOMMUN SYS","","","2018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5","Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Telecommunications","BM8JI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000469274400010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The LSTM achieves the highest classification accuracy of 52% and a RMSE of 8%. The popular ARIMA model for time series forecasting is implemented as a comparison to the deep learning models. As expected, the non-linear deep learning methods outperform the ARIMA forecast which performs poorly. Finally, both deep learning models are benchmarked on both a GPU and a CPU with the training time on the GPU outperforming the CPU implementation by 67.7%.","[McNally, Sean; Caton, Simon] Natl Coll Ireland, Sch Comp, Dublin 1, Ireland; [Roche, Jason] Dublin Business Sch, Dublin 2, Ireland","National College of Ireland","McNally, S (corresponding author), Natl Coll Ireland, Sch Comp, Dublin 1, Ireland.","sean.mcnally@ncirl.ie; jason.roche@dbs.ie; simon.caton@ncirl.ie","Caton, Simon/ABC-1531-2020","Caton, Simon/0000-0001-9379-3879","","","","","40","153","155","4","39","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1066-6192","","978-1-5386-4975-6","EUROMICRO WORKSHOP P","","","2018","","","","","","","339","343","","10.1109/PDP2018.2018.00060","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PDP2018.2018.00060","","","5","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BK8UW","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000443807600051","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Specifically, the model attempts to identify different regimes throughout the history of Bitcoin using the different available Bitcoin network characteristics, such as cost per transaction, number of transactions per block, number of active addresses and number of transactions. Estimation and diagnostic checks are performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In the empirical analysis, we show that our model is able to identify periods of crashes as one of these regimes, which is also a period of declining returns and declining number of active users. We also find that the number of users and the number of transactions determine the magnitude or persistence of a crash period.","[de Guzman, Rodolfo Angelo Magtanggol, III; So, Mike K.

In particular, the empirical results show that: (1) there exist power-law cross-correlations between CGT and Bitcoin returns as well as CGT and changes of volume; (2) the cross-correlations between CGT and returns have a higher degree of multifractal in the long-term and weak multifractal in the short-term, while the cross-correlations between CGT and change of volume show the opposite trend.

In the paradigms of fog computing, the fog user (outsourcer) with resource constraint devices can outsource the distributed computation tasks to the untrusted fog nodes (workers) and pays for them. Recently, plenty of research work has been done on fair payments. However, all existing solutions adopt the traditional e-cash system to generate payment token, which needs a trusted authority (i.e. a bank) to prevent double-spending. The bank will become the bottleneck of the payments system. In this paper, we propose a new fair payment scheme for outsourcing computations based on Bitcoin. Due to the advantages of Bitcoin syntax, the users can transact directly without needing a bank. Besides, the proposed construction can guarantee that no matter how a malicious outsourcer behaves, the honest workers will be paid if he completed the computing tasks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we propose PrivateNH, a privacy-enhancing and practical solution that offers anonymity and accountability for NHS users without relying on any trusted third party. PrivateNH leverages the recent progress of Bitcoin techniques such as Colored Coins and Coin-Shuffle to generate and maintain anonymous credentials for NHS participants. The credential holders (NHS hosts or guests) can then lease or rent short-term lodging and interact with the service provider in an anonymous and accountable manner. An anonymous and secure reputation system is also introduced to establish the trust between unfamiliar hosts and guests in a peer-to-peer fashion. The proposed scheme is compatible with the current Bitcoin blockchain system, and its effectiveness and feasibility in NHS scenario are also demonstrated by security analysis and performance evaluation.","[Zhou, Hengyu; Niu, Yukun; Zhang, Chi; Wei, Lingbo] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Hefei 230027, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Hengyu; Wei, Lingbo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, State Key Lab Informat Secur, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jianqing; Fang, Yuguang] Univ Florida, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Engineering, CAS; State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Zhang, C (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Hefei 230027, Peoples R China.","chizhang@ustc.edu.cn","zhang, chi/GRX-3610-2022; Fang, Yuguang/A-7484-2009","Fang, Yuguang/0000-0002-1079-3871; Liu, Jianqing/0000-0001-7568-015X","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0802202]; Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61702474]; US National Science Foundation [IIS-1722791]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under grant 2017YFB0802202 and by the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under grant 61702474.

Cryptography-based currencies, called as cryptocurrencies, are now leading the world's economy. With the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency exchanges have emerged to support cryptocurrency-related services. Among cryptocurrencies, bitcoin takes the lead and it is widely accepted by the world community. Lots of security issues are arising day by day and the exchange should handle all of of them sensibly. It is necessary that the exchange should be solvent all the time in terms of its assets and liabilities for its survival. For this, periodic settlement of the accounts should be done using appropriate techniques. The information exchange needed for this should be concealed from the adversaries. Cryptography-based techniques with zero-knowledge protocols are suitable for this purpose. Maxwell's proof of liabilities is the first cryptography-based method to verify the user assets. It makes use of binary Merkle hash trees for representing the proof of liabilities. The root node reveals the total assets of the exchange, which will attract the adversaries to execute an attack. Later the Dagher et al scheme, a privacy preserving proof of asset for bitcoin exchanges, was proposed. The scheme works in an interactive manner that requires the collaboration of the exchange and the user. This paper proposes an efficient non-interactive proof of assets for bitcoin exchanges.","[Mohan, Maya] NSS Coll Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Palakkad 678008, India; [Devi, M. K.

While these clusters can remain largely anonymous, the authors are able to ascribe many of them to particular business categories by analyzing some of their specific transaction patterns (TPs), as observed during the period from 2009 to 2015. The authors are then able to extract and create a map of the network of payment relationships among them, and analyze transaction behavior found in each business category. They conclude by identifying three marked regimes that have evolved as the Bitcoin economy has grown and matured: from an early prototype stage; to a second growth stage populated in large part with sin enterprise (i.e. gambling, black markets); to a third stage marked by a sharp progression away from sin and toward legitimate enterprises. Design/methodology/approach Data mining. Findings Four primary business categories are identified in the Bitcoin economy: miners, gambling services, black markets and exchanges. Common patterns of transaction behavior between the business categories and their users are a one-day holding period for bitcoin transactions is somewhat typical. That is, a one-day effect where traders, gamblers, black market participants and miners tend to cash out on a daily basis. There seems to be a strong preference to do business within the bitcoin economy in round lot amounts, whether it is more typical of traders exchanging for fiat money, gamblers placing bets or black market goods being bought and sold. Distinct patterns of transaction behavior among the business categories and their users are flows between traders and exchanges average just around 20 BTC, and traders buy or sell on average every 11 days. Meanwhile, gamblers wager just 0.5 BTC on average, but re-bet often within the same day. Three marked regimes have evolved, as the Bitcoin economy has grown and matured: from an early prototype stage, to a second growth stage populated in large part with sin enterprises (i.e. gambling, black markets), to a third stage marked by a sharp progression away from sin and toward legitimate enterprises. This evolution of the Bitcoin economy suggests a trend toward legitimate commerce. Originality/value The authors propose a new theoretical framework that allows investigating and exploring the network of payment relationships in the Bitcoin economy. This study starts by gathering together the minimum units of Bitcoin identities (the individual addresses), and it goes forward in grouping them into approximations of business entities, what is called super clusters, by using tested techniques from the literature. A super cluster can be thought of as an approximation of a business entity in that it describes a number of individual addresses that are owned or controlled collectively by the same beneficial owner for some special economic purposes. The majority of these important clusters are initially unknown and uncategorized. The novelty of this study is given by the pure user group and the TP analyses, by means of which the authors are able to ascribe the super clusters into specific business categories and outline a map of the network of payment relationships among them.","[Tasca, Paolo] UCL, London, England; [Hayes, Adam] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI USA; [Liu, Shaowen] Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany","University of London; University College London; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Deutsche Bank","Tasca, P (corresponding author), UCL, London, England.","p.tasca@ucl.ac.uk","Hayes, Adam/GVS-6281-2022","Hayes, Adam/0000-0001-5481-8906","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/R009724/1, ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/P031730/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/P031730/1] Funding Source: UKRI; ESRC [ES/R009724/1, ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","","","21","35","37","3","43","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1526-5943","2331-2947","","J RISK FINANC","J.

What determines its valuation is an important open question with far-reaching business and policy implications. Building on information systems and finance literature, we examine the dynamic interactions between social media and the monetary value of bitcoin using textual analysis and vector error correction models. We show that more bullish forum posts are associated with higher future bitcoin values. Interestingly, social media's effects on bitcoin are driven primarily by the silent majority, the 95 percent of users who are less active and whose contributions amount to less than 40 percent of total messages. In addition, messages on an Internet forum, relative to tweets, have a stronger impact on future bitcoin value. Overall, our findings reveal that social media sentiment is an important predictor in determining bitcoin's valuation, but not all social media messages are of equal impact.

We analyze the structure and the dynamics of this web of trust with a multilayer network approach distinguishing the rewarding and the punitive behaviors. We show that the rewarding and the punitive behavior have similar emergent topological properties (apart from the clustering coefficient being higher for the rewarding layer) and that the resultant reputation originates from the complex interaction of the more regular behaviors on the layers. We show which are the behaviors that correlate (i.e. the rewarding activity) or not (i.e. the punitive activity) with reputation. We show that the network activity presents bursty behaviors on both the layers and that the inequality reaches a steady value (higher for the rewarding layer) with the network evolution.

And we use the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) to analyze the inner fractal features of each time series's small and large fluctuations. The corresponding shuffled time series are also utilized to do the above two kinds of analysis, in order to distinguish what lead to the complexity synchronization and multifractal properties, the different long-range correlations for the times series' small and large fluctuations or the probability density functions for fluctuations of those nonstationary times series, or both of them.

Using daily data from July 17, 2010 to February 2, 2017, we employed several advanced autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models. The nonlinear ARDL approach was applied to uncover short- and long-run asymmetries, whereas the quantile ARDL was applied to account for a second type of asymmetry, known as the distributional asymmetry according to the position of a dependent variable within its own distribution. Moreover, we extended the nonlinear ARDL to a quantile framework, leading to a richer new model, which allows testing for distributional asymmetry while accounting for short- and long-run asymmetries. Overall, our results indicate the possibility to predict Bitcoin price movements based on price information from the aggregate commodity index and gold prices. Importantly, we report the nuanced result that most often the relations between bitcoin and aggregate commodity, on the one hand, and between bitcoin and gold, on the other, are asymmetric, nonlinear, and quantiles-dependent, suggesting the need to apply non-standard cointegration models to uncover the complexity and hidden relations between Bitcoin and asset classes.","[Bouri, Elie] Holy Spirit Univ Kaslik USEK, USEK Business Sch, POB 446, Jounieh, Lebanon; [Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa; [Lahiani, Amine] Univ Orleans, LEO, Orleans, France; [Lahiani, Amine; Shahbaz, Muhammad] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France","University of Pretoria; Universite de Orleans; Montpellier Business School","Bouri, E (corresponding author), Holy Spirit Univ Kaslik USEK, USEK Business Sch, POB 446, Jounieh, Lebanon.","eliebouri@usek.edu.lb; rangan.gupta@up.ac.za; amine.lahiani@univ-orleans.fr; muhdshahbaz77@gmail.com","Bouri, Elie/ABC-4197-2020; Bouri, Elie/N-1368-2015; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAD-9038-2019","Bouri, Elie/0000-0003-2628-5027; Bouri, Elie/0000-0003-2628-5027; ","","","","","34","100","100","4","39","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0301-4207","1873-7641","","RESOUR POLICY","Resour.

However, beside of its advantages, blockchain still face several challenges, one of them is scalability. One of the scalability challenges is increasing block size for every new transaction. The size of blockchain reached more than 180 GB. The block size will burden the node in conducting transaction verification. To overcome this problem, this paper has an objective to make summary blocks and compression for the summary blocks so that it can increase the space saving of blockchain and make it easier for nodes to verify transactions. The proposed method used for transactions whose entities can be transferred. This method combines block summarization algorithm and deflate compression algorithm. The proposed method applied to Bitcoin blockchain. Space saving is calculated by comparing the total size of original block with the total size of block that has been summarized and the total size of summary block which has been compressed. From the experiment results, the value of space saving for summary blocks is 22.318% and space saving for summary blocks that have been compressed is 78.104%.","[Nadiya, Ulfah] Indonesian Inst Sci, Tech Implementat Unit Instrumentat Dev, Bandung, Indonesia; [Mutijarsa, Kusprasapta; Cahyo, Rizqi Y.] Inst Teknol Bandung, Sch Elect Engn & Informat, Dept Elect Engn, Bandung, Indonesia","Indonesian Institute of Sciences; Institute Technology of Bandung","Nadiya, U (corresponding author), Indonesian Inst Sci, Tech Implementat Unit Instrumentat Dev, Bandung, Indonesia.","ulfahnadiya@gmail.com; soni@stei.itb.ac.id; yuwono.rizqi@gmail.com","","","","","","","16","11","11","0","5","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-6670-8","","","","2018","","","","","","","159","162","","","","","","4","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BL9TM","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000458316600033","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Ironically, as cryptocurrencies reached collective valuations of hundreds of billions of dollars the Bitcoin project failed in its original purpose as an alternative currency governed by code rather than trust. Not only has Bitcoin not become a popular means of global peer-to-peer transactions but the much vaulted purity of algorithmic governance is heavily entangled in social relations. This article reviews blockchain's computer architectures, its connections to materiality and space and the complexity of its established practices. This analysis shows that rather than occupying an algorithmic place apart, blockchain contains multiple and conflicting agencies and is messily embedded in the code/space of materiality. Nevertheless the faith in the superiority of algorithmic governance has injected a powerful discourse in economies that has proven more important and disruptive than the actual practices of Bitcoin or blockchain.","[Zook, Matthew A.; Blankenship, Joe] Univ Kentucky, Dept Geog, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","University of Kentucky","Zook, MA (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Geog, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.","zook@uky.edu","","","","","","","71","44","44","1","43","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0016-7185","1872-9398","","GEOFORUM","Geoforum","NOV","2018","96","","","","","","248","255","","10.1016/j.geoforum.2018.08.023","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2018.08.023","","","8","Geography","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Geography","GZ1LY","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000449130800026","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Importantly, sentiment is considered the crucial ingredient in price formation of now increasingly attractive digital currencies. Investors' beliefs affect exchange rates of those currencies considerably simply because of lack of fundamentals and regulation. In this paper we will examine the relationship between sentiment and price of the most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.

New business models and regulatory environments disrupt more traditional fee-based strategies, and new entrants seek to displace legacy players by leveraging new mobile platforms and new sources of data. In this increasingly diversified industry landscape, start-ups and established players are attempting to embed payment in 'social' experience through novel technologies of accounting for trust. This imagination of the social, however, is being materialized in gated platforms for payment, accounting, and exchange. This paper explores the ambiguous politics of such experiments, specifically those, like Bitcoin or the on-demand sharing economy, that delineate an economic imaginary of 'just us' - a closed and closely guarded community of peers operating under the illusion that there are no mediating institutions undergirding that community. This provokes questions about the intersection of payment and publics. Payment innovators' attenuated understanding of the social may, we suggest, evacuate the nitty-gritty of politics.","[Nelms, Taylor C.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Anthropol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Maurer, Bill] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Social Sci, Anthropol & Law, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Swartz, Lana] Univ Virginia, Dept Media Studies, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Mainwaring, Scott] Interval Res Corp, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Mainwaring, Scott] Intel Labs, Santa Clara, CA USA; [Mainwaring, Scott] Univ Calif Irvine, Intel Sci & Technol Ctr ISTC Social Comp, Irvine, CA USA","University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of Virginia; Intel Corporation; University of California System; University of California Irvine","Nelms, TC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Anthropol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.","tnelms@uci.edu","Maurer, Bill M/L-8561-2015","Maurer, Bill M/0000-0001-5339-9893","Filene Research Institute; US National Science Foundation Law and Social Sciences Program [SES 1455859, SES 0960423]; Balzan Prize; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1455859] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Filene Research Institute; US National Science Foundation Law and Social Sciences Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Balzan Prize; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Although we write as a collective, we wish to acknowledge that Nelms took the lead in producing this article.

In this paper we analyze the network performance of the Bitcoin public ledger when used as a massaging substrate. We present several real-world observations on its characteristics, transaction visibility, and fees paid to miners; and we propose two models for fee-cost estimation.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic payment system where payment transactions are stored in a data structure named the block-chain. Based on a fully decentralized network, the blockchain is maintained by a community of participants. In Bitcoin system, mining is the fundamental concept. In this paper, we design a new Bitcoin mining scheme based on the multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game model. To effectively implement the peer-to-peer relationship of Bitcoin system agents, we assume that mining pool operators are leaders and mining participating users are followers in our Stackelberg game. By using the dynamics of feedback-based repeated process, leaders, and followers can be interacting with one another and make their decisions in a way to reach an efficient system solution. Without the influence of any central authorities and organizations, the proposed method is practically applied to a distributed Bitcoin system. Through system level simulations, we show that our game approach outperforms the existing Bitcoin schemes in providing a better fair-efficient system performance.","[Kim, Sungwook] Sogang Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Seoul 121742, South Korea","Sogang University","Kim, S (corresponding author), Sogang Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Seoul 121742, South Korea.","swkim01@sogang.ac.kr","","","Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea, through the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) Support Program [IITP-2018-2018-0-01799]; IITP through the Korean Government (MSIT), under the Development of Deidentification Technique-Based on Differential Privacy [2017-0-00498]","Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea, through the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) Support Program; IITP through the Korean Government (MSIT), under the Development of Deidentification Technique-Based on Differential Privacy","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea, through the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) Support Program, supervised by the Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion (IITP), under Grant IITP-2018-2018-0-01799, and in part by IITP through the Korean Government (MSIT), under the Development of Deidentification Technique-Based on Differential Privacy under Grant 2017-0-00498.","","25","5","6","1","17","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2018","6","","","","","","48902","48912","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2867631","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2867631","","","11","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","GU6ID","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000445413500001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Instead of generating pairs of keys randomly which are hard to be stored, hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets derive all the keys from a single seed, thus storing that seed is sufficient to recover keys. In an HD wallet, it allows users to generate child public keys from parent public keys without knowledge of any private key. A suitable case for this feature is that an auditor is permitted to derive all the public keys for auditing. However, this impressive feature makes HD wallets suffered from so-called privilege escalation attacks that the leakage of any one of child private key along with its parent public key will cause the exposure of the other child private keys. To confront with this severe problem, we propose a novel HD wallet scheme that gives out a signature with trapdoor hash functions instead of directly giving anyone private keys for signing. Since it conceals private keys from any child nodes, it can prevent from privilege escalation attacks. Nevertheless, the proposed scheme also provides unlinkability between two public keys in order to achieve anonymity of user identity and high scalability to the derivations of keys. Thus, the proposed scheme achieves user anonymity, public key derivation and high scalability.","[Fan, Chun-I; Tseng, Yi-Fan; Su, Hui-Po] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Hsu, Ruei-Hau] Inst Infocomm Res Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Singapore, Singapore; [Kikuchi, Hiroaki] Meiji Univ, Dept Frontier Media Sci, Tokyo 1648525, Japan","National Sun Yat Sen University; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R); Meiji University","Fan, CI (corresponding author), Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.","cifan@mail.cse.nsysu.edu.tw; rhhsu0711@gmail.com; kikn@meiji.ac.jp","Hsu, Ruei-Hau/A-5298-2016","Hsu, Ruei-Hau/0000-0003-0856-9229","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST 105-2923-E-110-001-MY3, MOST 107-2218-E-110-014]; Intelligent Electronic Commerce Research Center from The Featured Areas Research Center Program by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Intelligent Electronic Commerce Research Center from The Featured Areas Research Center Program by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan","This work was partially supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan under grants MOST 105-2923-E-110-001-MY3, MOST 107-2218-E-110-014, and financially supported by the Intelligent Electronic Commerce Research Center from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan.","","20","0","0","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-5790-4","","","","2018","","","","","","","308","315","","","","","","8","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BM3FW","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000462054900040","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We found that chaos is only present in prices during both periods, whilst the level of uncertainty in returns has significantly increased during the high-price time period. Furthermore, both prices and returns exhibit long-range correlations and multi-fractality. The fat-tailed probability distributions are the main source of multi-fractality in the time series of prices and returns. Finally, short (long) fluctuations in returns are dominant during low (high) price-regime time period, respectively. Overall, the high-price regime phase has profoundly revealed consistent nonlinear dynamical patterns in the Bitcoin market. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It is a process that makes Bitcoin extremely energy-hungry by design, as the currency requires a huge amount of hash calculations for its ultimate goal of processing financial transactions without intermediaries (peer-to-peer). The primary fuel for each of these calculations is electricity. The Bitcoin network can be estimated to consume at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future, making it comparable with countries such as Ireland (3.1 gigawatts) and Austria (8.2 gigawatts). Economic models tell us that Bitcoin's electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter number. A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018.","[de Vries, Alex] Experience Ctr PwC, Amsterdam, Netherlands","","de Vries, A (corresponding author), Experience Ctr PwC, Amsterdam, Netherlands.","alex.de.vries@pwc.com","de Vries, Alex/HCI-0924-2022","de Vries, Alex/0000-0002-9594-1289","","","","","15","179","180","3","52","CELL PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA","2542-4351","","","JOULE","Joule","MAY 16","2018","2","5","","","","","801","805","","10.1016/j.joule.2018.04.016","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2018.04.016","","","5","Chemistry, Physical; Energy & Fuels; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Chemistry; Energy & Fuels; Materials Science","GJ2IM","","Bronze","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000435093800002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The main factor that determines the presence or absence of resources to finance investment processes is the amount of money in circulation. In this regard, in recent decades, the world financial system has been increasingly faced with the issue of the money supply increase. The process of increasing the currency in circulation should not get out of control; it has to satisfy the needs of world economy sustainable development and at the same time ensure the stability of the international financial markets functioning. Thus, today the issue of finding an international payment facility that would ensure the sustainable development of the world economy on the basis of a controlled growth of the money supply in circulation is an acute one. The way to solve the problem of the money in circulation optimization can be found in so-called cryptographic currencies, the leader among which nowadays is Bitcoin. The purpose of this study is to find the answer to the question: Can Bitcoin's usage as an international means of payment be a way to solve the issue of the money in circulation optimization in order to maintain sustainable development of the world economy? The study is based on an analysis of the statistical data available at The World Bank, Blockchain Luxembourg SA, MS Brokers Europe Limited.

Interestingly, there is no consensus on the properties and abstractions that fully capture the behaviour of distributed ledgers. The interest in formalising the behaviour of distributed ledgers is twofold. Firstly, it helps to prove the correctness of the algorithms that implement existing distributed ledgers and explore their limits with respect to an unfriendly environment and target applications. Secondly, it facilitates the identification of the minimal building blocks necessary to implement the distributed ledger in a specific environment. Even though the behaviour of distributed ledgers is similar to abstractions that have been deeply studied for decades in distributed systems no abstraction is sufficiently powerful to capture the distributed ledger behaviour. This paper introduces the Distributed Ledger Register, a register that mimics the behaviour of one of the most popular distributed ledger, i.e. the Bitcoin ledger. The aim of our work is to provide formal guarantees on the coherent evolution of Bitcoin. We furthermore show the conditions under which the Bitcoin blockchain maintenance algorithm satisfies the distributed ledger register properties. Moreover, we prove that the Distributed Ledger Register verifies the specification of a regular register. We show that in partially synchronous systems, the strongest coherency implemented by Bitcoin is regularity when reads are sparse. This study contradicts the common belief that Bitcoin implements strong coherency criteria in a totally asynchronous system. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one that makes the connection between the distributed ledgers and the classical theory of distributed shared registers.","[Anceaume, Emmanuelle] CNRS IRISA, Campus Beaulieu, Rennes, France; [Ludinard, Romaric] CREST ENSAI, Rennes, France; [Potop-Butucaru, Maria] Univ P&M Curie, LIP6, Paris, France; [Tronel, Frederic] Cent Supelec, Rennes, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Analyse de l'Information (ENSAI); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay","Anceaume, E (corresponding author), CNRS IRISA, Campus Beaulieu, Rennes, France.","anceaume@irisa.fr","","","","","","","17","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-319-69084-1; 978-3-319-69083-4","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","10616","","","","","","456","468","","10.1007/978-3-319-69084-1_34","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-69084-1_34","","","13","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR8RR","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000672799500034","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This paper proposes solutions to assist law enforcement agencies in piecing together the disparate and complex technical, behavioural and criminological elements that make up cybercriminal offending. Design/methodology/approach A literature review was conducted to highlight the main law enforcement challenges and discussions and examine current discourse in the areas of anonymity and attribution. The paper also looked at other research and projects that aim to identify illicit transactions involving cryptocurrencies and the darknet. Findings An optimal solution would be one which has a predictive capability and a machine learning architecture which automatically collects and analyses data from the Bitcoin blockchain and other external data sources and applies search criteria matching, indexing and clustering to identify suspicious behaviours. The implementation of a machine learning architecture would help improve results over time and would be less manpower intensive. Cyber investigators would also receive intelligence in a format and language that they understand and it would allow for intelligence-led and predictive policing rather than reactive policing. The optimal solution would be one which allows for intelligence-led, predictive policing and enables and encourages information sharing between multiple stakeholders from the law enforcement, financial intelligence units, cyber security organisations and fintech industry. This would enable the creation of red flags and behaviour models and the provision of up-to-date intelligence on the threat landscape to form a viable intelligence product for law enforcement agencies so that they can more easily get to the who, what, when and where.

In spite of this intense battle, the answer to a primary question is absent - Do Bitcoin users themselves care about anonymity? This paper demystifies this doubt via analyzing the Bitcoin transaction graphs with the following three contributions: 1). We outline three representative metrics that can signify whether users concern about anonymity. 2). We examine the collective trend of anonymity concerns from a macroscope. 3). We pay particular attention on critical addresses in a microscope to unveil their anonymity concerns. This paper arrives at both expected conclusions and unexpected surprises. In particular, the expected ones are: rich addresses concern more about anonymity than poor ones. Miner addresses start caring about anonymity when exchange rate soars. Stock addresses never hide their intent of jump-and-dump. The surprises are: the majority of the users show weak concerns on anonymity. One can easily find both hot and cold wallet addresses owned by big organizations.","[Gaihre, Anil; Luo, Yan; Liu, Hang] Univ Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, MA 01854 USA","University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Lowell","Gaihre, A (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, MA 01854 USA.","","Gaihre, Anil/AAB-5486-2020","","XSEDE supercomputers; Amazon AWS; US National Science Foundation [1547428, 1541434, 1738965, 1450996]","XSEDE supercomputers; Amazon AWS; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We thank the anonymous reviewers, Hans-Edward Hoene and Zhenlin Wu for their helpful suggestions.

Bitcoin is a decentralized recordkeeping system, with updating of the record of transactions in the blockchain. Potentially, Bitcoin could be useful if it is widely used as a means of payment or as a safe-haven asset.

One of its most important properties is the high level of anonymity it provides for its users. The users are identified by their Bitcoin addresses, which are random strings in the public records of transactions, the blockchain. When a user initiates a Bitcoin transaction, his Bitcoin client program relays messages to other clients through the Bitcoin network. Monitoring the propagation of these messages and analyzing them carefully reveal hidden relations. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model using a probabilistic approach to link Bitcoin addresses and transactions to the originator IP address. To utilize our model, we carried out experiments by installing more than a hundred modified Bitcoin clients distributed in the network to observe as many messages as possible. During a two month observation period we were able to identify several thousand Bitcoin clients and bind their transactions to geographical locations.","[Juhasz, Peter L.; Steger, Jozsef; Kondor, Daniel; Vattay, Gabor] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Phys Complex Syst, Budapest, Hungary; [Juhasz, Peter L.] Ericsson Telecommun Hungary, Business Unit IT & Cloud Prod, Budapest, Hungary; [Kondor, Daniel] MIT, SENSEable City Lab, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Eotvos Lorand University; Ericsson; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)","Steger, J (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Phys Complex Syst, Budapest, Hungary.","steger@complex.elte.hu","Vattay, Gabor/G-9638-2017; Stéger, József/ABC-5922-2021; Vattay, Gabor/Q-4266-2019; Kondor, Daniel/AAD-9871-2019","Vattay, Gabor/0000-0002-0919-9429; Stéger, József/0000-0003-2836-1855; Kondor, Daniel/0000-0003-3720-7462; Juhasz, Peter Laszlo/0000-0002-5890-6310","Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office [KH125280, 125280]; Ericsson Ltd.; Ericsson Inc.","Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office(National Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary); Ericsson Ltd.(Ericsson); Ericsson Inc.(Ericsson)","The authors thank the Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office under Grant No. 125280 and the grant of Ericsson Ltd.

We use a quantile-on-quantile regression approach to capture the dependence structure between the considered market returns under different Bitcoin market conditions, while considering nuances of oil price movements, compared to gold. Our findings show that both Bitcoin and gold would serve the roles of a hedge, a safe haven and a diversifier for oil price movements. However, this property seems to be sensitive to the Bitcoin's and gold's different (bear, normal or bull) market conditions and to whether the oil price is in a downside, normal or upside regime. By controlling for new and relevant U.S. and global uncertainty indicators, we confirm that both Bitcoin and gold, but not oil, are assets where investors may park their cash during times of political and economic turmoil. The conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) approach to risk management is then conducted, providing robust evidence of the usefulness of each of the Bitcoin and gold in expanded oil portfolios, in terms of diversification opportunities and downside risk reductions.

In this paper, we consider the threats a quantum-capable adversary could impose on Bitcoin, which currently uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to sign transactions. We then propose a simple but slow commit-delav-reveal protocol, which allows users to securely move their funds from old (non-quantum-resistant) outputs to those adhering to a quantum-resistant digital signature scheme. The transition protocol functions even if ECDSA has already been compromised.

Our approach consists of predicting the price through reproducing synthetic yet realistic behaviors of rational agents in a simulated market, instead of estimating relationships between the price and price-related factors. IRL provides a systematic way to find the behavioral rules of each agent from Blockchain data by framing the trading behavior estimation as a problem of recovering motivations from observed behavior and generating rules consistent with these motivations. Once the rules are recovered, an agent-based model creates hypothetical interactions between the recovered behavioral rules, discovering equilibrium prices as emergent features through matching the supply and demand of Bitcoin. One distinct aspect of our approach with ABM is that while conventional approaches manually design individual rules, our agents' rules are channeled from IRL. Our experimental results show that the proposed method can predict short-term market price while outlining overall market trend.","[Lee, Kamwoo; Ulkuatam, Sinan; Beling, Peter; Scherer, William] Univ Virginia, Dept Syst & Informat Engn, 151 Engineers Way, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA","University of Virginia","Lee, K (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Syst & Informat Engn, 151 Engineers Way, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.","kl9ch@virginia.edu","","Scherer, William/0000-0002-1069-7898; Beling, Peter/0000-0003-2196-6982","","","","","16","11","11","1","22","J A S S S","GUILDFORD","UNIV SURREY, DEPT SOCIOLOGY, GUILDFORD GU2 7XH, SURREY, ENGLAND","1460-7425","","","JASSS-J ARTIF SOC S","JASSS","JUN 30","2018","21","3","","","","","","","5","10.18564/jasss.3733","http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.3733","","","11","Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Social Sciences - Other Topics","GO3AC","","gold, Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000439852500005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Trust is a notion that has been studied extensively in sociology, psychology, economics and compuer science, with an objective to provide measures for quantifying user behavior in specific social settings and contexts. While in the domain of online social networks, the trust has been thoroughly analyzed from various points of view, in cryptocurrency exchange platforms, the questions about quantifying the levels of emerging trust, are still open. In this work, we elaborate on quantifying trust in the context of cryptocurrency exchange platforms. We focus on two well known bitcoin exchange platforms: BitcoinOTC and Bitcoin-Alpha. Using the existing data about user ratings upon interactions in these two platforms, we show how trust is related with the network structure and how to identify communities where trust level is high among participants.

Each offers a theory not just of money, but also of relations, identities, and the larger imaginaries we call society' and the economy'. In particular, they offer distinct visions of what it means to be a peer' in a peer-to-peer money system, and perhaps, a peer-to-peer society.

Although Bitcoin participants which create new blocks cannot modify their order, they can manipulate timestamps almost undetected. This undermines the Bitcoin protocol as a reliable timestamping service. In particular, a newcomer that synchronizes the entire blockchain has a little guarantee about timestamps of all blocks. In this paper, we present a simple yet powerful mechanism that increases the reliability of Bitcoin timestamps. Our protocol can provide evidence that a block was created within a certain time range. The protocol is efficient, backward compatible, and surprisingly, currently deployed SSL/TLS servers can act as reference time sources.

Due to their frequent charging needs, not only public and private charging stations are being built, but also V2V charging options are considered. This forms a charging network with various suppliers and EV customers which can communicate to schedule charging operations. While an app can be designed to develop matching algorithms for charging schedules, the system also needs a convenient payment method that will enable privacy-preserving transactions among the suppliers and EVs. In this paper, we adopt a Bitcoin-based payment system for the EV charging network payments. However, Bitcoin has a transaction fee which would be comparable to the price of the charging service most of the time and thus may not be attractive to users. High transaction fees can be eliminated by building a payment network in parallel to main ledger, with permission and signatures. In this paper, we design and implement such a network among charging stations and mobile EVs with flow, connectivity and fairness constraints, and demonstrate results for the feasibility of the scheme under different circumstances. More specifically, we propose a payment network optimization model for determining payment channels among charging stations. We present numerical results on the characteristics of the network model by using realistic use cases.","[Erdin, Enes; Cebe, Mumin; Akkaya, Kemal; Uluagac, Selcuk] Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Solak, Senay] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA USA; [Bulut, Eyuphan] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA USA","State University System of Florida; Florida International University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Virginia Commonwealth University","Erdin, E (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA.","eerdi001@fiu.edu; mcebe@fiu.edu; kakkaya@fiu.edu; solak@isenberg.umass.edu; ebulut@vcu.edu; suluagac@fiu.edu","Erdin, Enes/AAY-8226-2020; Erdin, Enes/AAZ-4970-2021","Erdin, Enes/0000-0003-2979-8143; Cebe, Mumin/0000-0003-2843-8904","","","","","24","11","11","5","7","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-7975-3","","","","2018","","","","","","","1609","1615","","10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00269","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00269","","","7","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BN4AE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000481634500234","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Extremist xenophobia is on the rise. In contrast, we propose an optimistic analysis for the future. It is flows and trends that characterize flows. Born in advanced thermodynamics, the constructal theory of design and evolution in nature proposes that 'for a finite-size flow system to persist in time (to live) it must evolve such that it provides greater and greater access to the currents that flow through it.' Papers [1-2] demonstrate that constuctal law applies to both inanimate systems with flow (rivers basins, turbulent flow, self-lubrication) and animate systems with flow (lungs, cardio-vascular system, animal locomotion). Constructal law also applies to man made systems ([3-5]). Social, political, or economic systems (financial and monetary system, trade and exchanges of raw materials, industrial products and services), intangible capital flows globally (knowledge, human capital, market capital, and process capital, including cyber-attacks), are all governed by the constructal law of design and evolution in nature. We propose a research agenda to verify how constructal law predicts global policy making. Evolution of monetary system from barter exchanges to rise of virtual currencies, rise of cyber attacks, and latest with bitcoin, all fit constructal law.","[Petrescu, Adrian S.] InnovationTrek, 3212 Cass St, Omaha, NE 68131 USA; [Panea, Ovidiu] CoEvolve, 11 Eroii Sanitari Blvd, Bucharest 050471, Romania","","Petrescu, AS (corresponding author), InnovationTrek, 3212 Cass St, Omaha, NE 68131 USA.","ASPetrescu@InnovationTrek.org","","","","","","","10","0","0","0","11","EDITURA ACAD ROMANE","BUCURESTI","CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCURESTI 050711, ROMANIA","1454-9069","","","P ROMANIAN ACAD A","Proc.

With the increasing importance of bitcoin, many related topics require further clarification. Because bitcoin is a popular financial asset, determining whether the price information is fully circulated among trading platforms has been the focus of many studies in recent years. The method for verifying the efficient market hypothesis relates to whether the price series is a random walk; that is, whether a unit root exists. According to the literature, whether the price of bitcoin satisfies the efficient market hypothesis remains controversial; however, these studies have not considered nonlinear data structures. To deal with the structural change of data, this study employed different unit root tests, namely the Zivot-Andrews unit root test and Kapetanios-Shin unit root test, to investigate bitcoins' relationship to the efficient market hypothesis. If the efficient market hypothesis is validated, the price formed by the bitcoin trading platform is close to a perfectly competitive mechanism, and the information can be quickly and completely reflected in the price, with information of different trading platforms having mutual influence. Therefore, this study applied the threshold vector autoregressive model to explore price information transmission between various trading platforms. The contribution of this research is its exploration of the financial tools derived from the highly developed fields of financial science and technology. This is helpful for providing new methods for completing financial transactions or a platform for speculators to engage in arbitrage.","[Chang, Tin-Chang] Asia Univ, Dept Digital Media Design, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chang, Tin-Chang; Chen, Yung-Lin] Asia Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taichung, Taiwan","Asia University Taiwan; Asia University Taiwan","Chang, TC (corresponding author), Asia Univ, Dept Digital Media Design, Taichung, Taiwan.;Chang, TC (corresponding author), Asia Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taichung, Taiwan.","","","","","","","","35","0","0","1","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2159-5100","","978-1-8908-4337-3","PORTL INT CONF MANAG","","","2018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Management","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Engineering; Business & Economics","BT0GR","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000787774300195","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In order to achieve this, Mining pools distribute amongst the workers the task of finding a block so that each worker works on a different subset of the candidate solutions. In most mining pools the selection of transactions to be part of the next block is performed by the pool manager and thus becomes more centralized. A mining Pool is expected to give priority to the most lucrative transactions in order to increase the block reward however changes to the transaction policy done without notification of workers would be difficult to detect. In this paper we treat the transaction selection policy performed by miners as a classification problem; for each block we create a dataset, separate them by mining pool and apply feature selection techniques to extract a vector of importance for each feature. We then track variations in feature importance as new blocks arrive and show using a generated scenario how a change in policy by a mining pool could be detected.","[Pontiveros, Beltran Borja Fiz; Norvill, Robert; State, Radu] Univ Luxembourg, Sedan Grp, SnT, 29 Av John F Kennedy, L-1855 Luxembourg, Luxembourg","University of Luxembourg","Pontiveros, BBF (corresponding author), Univ Luxembourg, Sedan Grp, SnT, 29 Av John F Kennedy, L-1855 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.","beltran.fiz@uni.lu; robert.norvill@uni.lu; radu.state@uni.lu","","","","","","","36","4","4","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1542-1201","","978-1-5386-3416-5","IEEE IFIP NETW OPER","","","2018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP2CO","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000541820800216","View Full Record in Web of Science"

To do this, we monitor the Pastebin feed from Sep 2017-Mar 2018 to find exposed secret Bitcoin keys, revealing that attackers could have stolen 22.40 BTC worth roughly $178,000 given current exchange rates. Then, we focus on implicit key leakage by exploiting the wrong usage of cryptographic primitives and scan Bitcoin's blockchain for ECDSA nonce reuse. We systematically outline how an attacker can use duplicate r values to leak nonces and secret keys, which goes beyond the simple case where the same nonce and the same key have been used in conjunction more than once. Our results show that ECDSA nonce reuse has been a recurring problem in the Bitcoin ecosystem and has already been exploited by attackers. In fact, an attacker could have exploited nonce reuse to steal 412.80 BTC worth roughly $3.3 million.","[Brengel, Michael; Rossow, Christian] Saarland Univ, CISPA, Saarbrucken, Germany","Saarland University","Brengel, M (corresponding author), Saarland Univ, CISPA, Saarbrucken, Germany.","michael.brengel@cispa.saarland; rossow@cispa.saarland","","","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, RAMSES [700326]","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, RAMSES","This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, RAMSES, under grant agreement No. 700326.","","16","14","16","0","2","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-00470-5; 978-3-030-00469-9","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","11050","","","","","","623","643","","10.1007/978-3-030-00470-5_29","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00470-5_29","","","21","Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BN2MA","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000476933900029","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We propose a novel DRM scheme based on P2P to protect valuable digital content. The digital content is firstly encrypted with a symmetric cryptographic algorithm, and then the symmetric key is encrypted by the RSA scheme such that any unpaid user cannot access the digital content. The symmetric key is only held by the content provider for avoiding the risk of the server leaking the symmetric key. By exploiting Bitcoin system, the content provider and the user have the ability to make a direct payment without relying on the server. Moreover, the payment is a timely payment, that is, when the user's payment is completed, he/she will obtain the private key of RSA immediately. In our scheme, users can download ciphertext of the digital content from any peer who owns the digital content early. In addition, a payment voucher is used to verify users who have paid for the digital content, which can also against the collusion attack. We anonymize the authentication process for protecting the users' privacy. The security analysis shows that our scheme can provide message confidentiality, anonymity of users, and can resist poisoning attack and collusion attack. The simulation shows that our scheme is efficient and practical.","[Wang, Danni; Gao, Juntao; Yu, Haiyong] ISN State Key Lab China, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Xuelian] Xidian Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Xidian University","Gao, JT (corresponding author), ISN State Key Lab China, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.","jtgao@mail.xidian.edu.cn","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFB0800601]; Natural Science Foundation of China [61303217, 61502372]; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi province [2013JQ8002, 2014JQ8313]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi province(Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province)","This work is supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2016YFB0800601), the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61303217, 61502372), the Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi province (No. 2013JQ8002, 2014JQ8313).","","25","5","5","0","2","SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD","SINGAPORE","152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE","1865-0929","1865-0937","978-981-13-3095-7; 978-981-13-3094-0","COMM COM INF SC","","","2018","879","","","","","","227","240","","10.1007/978-981-13-3095-7_18","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-3095-7_18","","","14","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BQ8UM","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000621770200018","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We propose a solution for enabling instore payments with waiting times in the order of a few seconds, which is still compatible with the current Bitcoin protocol. The idea is based on a payment card in combination with a protocol for ensuring that losing a card does not mean losing the money on it.

The security of Bitcoin heavily relies on the incentive-compatible proof-of-work (PoW) based distributed consensus protocol, which is run by the network nodes called miners. In exchange for the incentive, the miners are expected to maintain the blockchain honestly. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150 billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its major components along with their functionality and interactions within the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving solutions. Finally, we summarize the critical open challenges, and we suggest directions for future research towards provisioning stringent security and privacy solutions for Bitcoin.","[Conti, Mauro; Lal, Chhagan] Univ Padua, Dept Math, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Kumar, E.

Such an attack was first given by Biryukov, Khovratovich and Pustogarov based on their observation that a node can be uniquely identified in a single session by their directly-connected neighbouring nodes (ACM CCS'15). However, the BKP15 attack is less effective across multiple sessions. To address this issue, Biryukov and Pustogarov later on devised a new strategy exploiting certain properties of address-cookies (IEEE S&P'15). Unfortunately, the BP15 attack is also rendered ineffective by the present modification to the Bitcoin client. In this paper, we devise an efficient method to link the sessions of unreachable nodes, even if they connect to the Bitcoin network over the Tor. We achieve this using a new approach based on organizing the block-requests made by the nodes in a Bitcoin session graph. This attack also works against the modified Bitcoin client. We performed experiments on the Bitcoin main network, and were able to link consecutive sessions with a precision of 0.90 and a recall of 0.71. We also provide counter-measures to mitigate the attacks.","[Mastan, Indra Deep] Indian Inst Technol Gandhinagar, Gandhinagar, India; [Paul, Souradyuti] Indian Inst Technol Bhilai, Raipur, Madhya Pradesh, India","Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Gandhinagar; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bhilai","Mastan, ID (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Gandhinagar, Gandhinagar, India.","immastan@gmail.com; souradyuti.paul@gmail.com","","","","","","","8","10","8","1","3","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-02641-7; 978-3-030-02640-0","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","11261","","","","","","277","298","","10.1007/978-3-030-02641-7_13","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-02641-7_13","","","22","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BQ7CL","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000614509900013","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Its security rests critically on the distributed protocol that maintains the blockchain, run by participants called miners. Conventional wisdom asserts that the mining protocol is incentive-compatible and secure against colluding minority groups, that is, it incentivizes miners to follow the protocol as prescribed. We show that the Bitcoin mining protocol is not incentive-compatible. We present an attack with which colluding miners' revenue is larger than their fair share. The attack can have significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational miners will prefer to join the attackers, and the colluding group will increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system ceases to be a decentralized currency. Unless certain assumptions are made, selfish mining may be feasible for any coalition size of colluding miners. We propose a practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects Bitcoin in the general case. It prohibits selfish mining by a coalition that command less than 1/4 of the resources. This threshold is lower than the wrongly assumed 1/2 bound, but better than the current reality where a coalition of any size can compromise the system.","[Eyal, Ittay] Technion, Initiat Cryptocurrencies & Contracts, Elect Engn, Haifa, Israel; [Sirer, Emin Gun] Cornell Univ, Initiat Cryptocurrencies & Contracts, Comp Sci, Ithaca, NY USA","Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Cornell University","Eyal, I (corresponding author), Technion, Initiat Cryptocurrencies & Contracts, Elect Engn, Haifa, Israel.","ittay@technion.ac.il; egs@systems.cs.cornell.edu","","","NSF Trust STC; DARPA","NSF Trust STC; DARPA(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA))","This research was supported by the NSF Trust STC and by DARPA.","","23","140","148","3","62","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA","0001-0782","1557-7317","","COMMUN ACM","Commun.

However, there have been few measurement studies on the level of decentralization they achieve in practice. We present a measurement study on various decentralization metrics of two of the leading cryptocurrencies with the largest market capitalization and user base, Bitcoin and Ethereum. We investigate the extent of decentralization by measuring the network resources of nodes and the interconnection among them, the protocol requirements affecting the operation of nodes, and the robustness of the two systems against attacks. In particular, we adapted existing internet measurement techniques and used the Falcon Relay Network as a novel measurement tool to obtain our data. We discovered that neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum has strictly better properties than the other.

Starting around Bitcoin addresses of potential interest, neighborhood subgraphs are analyzed in terms of path length and confluence to detect suspicious Bitcoin flow and other wallet addresses controlled by the suspected perpetrators.

The information is verified and stored across the nodes as a distributed data ledger, the Blockchain. A node can have a maximum of 8 outgoing connections. The selection of outgoing connections are carried out in a random manner and information is broadcasted to these nodes by flooding. Transaction propagation delays in the network results in temporary inconsistencies in the ledger information resulting in blockchain forks. These can lead to possible double spending attacks. This paper addresses the issue of transaction propagation delay in the network. We present a simulation model of Bitcoin network. The effect of varying the number of outgoing connections and its implication in propagation delay is analyzed to determine the optimum limit of outgoing connections. Further, the idea of selection of nodes based on combination of two parameters, proximity to the sending node and random selection and its effect on transaction propagation delay is explored. Simulation results prove that this method further decreases transaction propagation delay.","[Sudhan, Amool; Nene, Manisha J.] Def Inst Adv Technol DU, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Pune, Maharashtra, India","Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO); Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT)","Sudhan, A (corresponding author), Def Inst Adv Technol DU, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Pune, Maharashtra, India.","avengermceme@gmail.com; mjnene@diat.ac.in","Nene, Manisha/AIA-8741-2022","","","","","","17","3","3","0","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-2842-3","","","","2018","","","","","","","679","684","","","","","","6","Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science","BM8AW","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000468730700125","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Here we address the problem of validating open scripts, i.e. we address the validation of redeeming scripts against the whole set of possible inputs, i.e. under which general conditions can Bitcoins be redeemed? Even if likely not one of the most complex languages and demanding verification problems, we advocate the merit of formal verification for the Bitcoin validation framework. We propose a symbolic verification theory for open script, a verifier toolkit, and illustrate examples of use on Bitcoin transactions. Contributions include (1) a formalisation of (a fragment of script) the language; (2) a novel symbolic approach to SCRIPT verification, suitable, e.g. for the verification of newly defined and non-standard payment schemes; and (3) building blocks for a larger verification theory for the developing area of Bitcoin smart contracts.

In order to clarify how Bitcoin is used, it is in great importance to identify what kind of services are operated by Bitcoin addresses. In this paper, we propose a multi-class service identification scheme in Bitcoin based on novel transaction history summarization. Our novelty is to propose how transaction history is retrieved and how the retrieved transactions are processed for better identification. When a Bitcoin address is given, the characteristics of its transaction history is calculated as features. Then, the set of calculated features is fed into a supervised classifier and the services operated by the given Bitcoin addresses are identified among seven major services: (i) exchange, (ii) faucet, (iii) gambling, (iv) investment scam, (v) marketplace, (vi) mining pool, and (vii) mixer. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose a multi-class identification.

In addition, we assess the time-variations in the market efficiency level through using a rolling-window framework. Our evidence shows that the efficiency of the Bitcoin market changes over time and this market seems to be more efficient during downward than upward periods. We also find that Bitcoin is marked by a persistent long memory phenomenon in its short- term components, which could be interpreted as a possible speculation by investors.","[Selmi, Refk] ESC Pau Business Sch, IRMAPE, Pau, France; [Selmi, Refk] Univ Pau, CATT, Pau, France; [Tiwari, Aviral Kumar; Hammoudeh, Shawkat] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Tiwari, Aviral Kumar] Rajagiri Business Sch, Kochi, Kerala, India; [Hammoudeh, Shawkat] Drexel Univ, Lebow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour; Montpellier Business School; Rajagiri Business School (RBS); Drexel University","Selmi, R (corresponding author), ESC Pau Business Sch, IRMAPE, Pau, France.;Selmi, R (corresponding author), Univ Pau, CATT, Pau, France.","s.refk@yahoo.fr; aviral.eco@gmail.com; shawkat.hammoudeh@gmail.com","Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/C-5556-2011","Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/0000-0002-1822-9263","","","","","24","13","14","0","3","ECONOMICS BULLETIN","NASHVILLE","C/O JOHN CONLEY, DEPT ECONOMICS, 414 CALHOUN HALL, NASHVILLE, TN 37235 USA","1545-2921","","","ECON BULL","Econ.

Bitcoin is the first and most prevalent decentralized crypto-currency to date. It is decentralized peer-to-peer digital currency in which coins are produced by an appropriated set of excavators and exchange are communicated by means of a peer-to-peer organize. While Bitcoin gives some level of secrecy by urging clients to have any number of irregular looking Bitcoin addresses, late research demonstrates that this level of obscurity is fairly low. This urges clients to associate with the Bitcoin arrange through anonymizers like Tor and propels advancement of default Tor usefulness for prevalent versatile customers. A low-asset aggressor can increase full control of data streams between all clients who utilized Bitcoin over Tor. Specifically, the aggressor can connect together client's exchanges paying little respect to pen names, control which Bitcoin squares and exchanges are handed-off to the client and can defer or dispose of client's exchanges and pieces. Bitcoins have risen as a conceivable competitor to regular monetary forms, yet other crypto-monetary forms have similarly showed up as competitors to the Bitcoin currency. The extending business sector of crypto-monetary forms now includes capital comparable to 1010 US Dollars, furnishing the scholarly community with a bizarre chance to examine the development of significant worth. Bitcoin is an absolutely online virtual currency, unbaked by either physical wares or sovereign commitment; rather, it depends on a mix of cryptographic security and a peer-to-peer protocol for seeing settlements.

In order to understand the stochastic behavior of the transaction-confirmation process, we consider a queueing model with batch service and general input. In our queueing model, we assume that the transaction interarrival times are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and follow a general distribution, and that the transactions waiting in the queue are served in a batch manner. We define the number of transactions in queue just before a transaction arrival as the system state, deriving the steady-state distribution and the mean transaction-confirmation time by matrix analytic method. In numerical examples, we compare analytical results with trace-driven simulation, discussing the applicability of our queueing model to the prediction of the transaction-confirmation time. It is found that exponential-type distributions such as exponential distribution and hyper-exponential one can accurately estimate the mean transaction-confirmation time for the current maximum block-size limit of 1 Mbyte.","[Kawase, Yoshiaki; Kasahara, Shoji] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Takayama 8916-5, Nara 6300192, Japan","Nara Institute of Science & Technology","Kawase, Y (corresponding author), Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Takayama 8916-5, Nara 6300192, Japan.","kawase.yoshiaki.km3@is.naist.jp; kasahara@ieee.org","","Kasahara, Shoji/0000-0001-9785-8350","SCAT Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15H04008]","SCAT Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","This research was supported in part by SCAT Foundation, and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science under Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) No. 15H04008.","","19","9","8","0","5","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-7975-3","","","","2018","","","","","","","1440","1447","","10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00245","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00245","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BN4AE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000481634500210","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Based on this observation, in this paper, we focus on explicit cancellation of transactions to improve the fairness for users. We propose a novel scheme with which it is possible to cancel a transaction, whether it is confirmed in a block or not, under certain conditions.

While the output of a Publicly Verifiable Randomness is provably unpredictable for a strong adversary, it is expected that its closeness to a uniform distribution is verifiable for any party. The inherent randomness in public blockchains such as Bitcoin has been the topic of several research papers and been used in lotteries and other multi-party protocols. However, recently it has been argued that an adversary can have a significant impact on the probability distribution of the output with much lower financial cost. Here, in this paper, we propose a new scheme based on the properties of Verifiable Secret Sharing protocols and Threshold Cryptosystems, that uses semi-trusted third parties to improve the security of Verifiable Public Randomness from any public blockchain.

However, the anonymity makes illegal trades possible because nobody is able to reveal the real identities of the illegal users. In this paper, we propose a regulation scheme based on the ciphertext-policy hierarchical attribute-based encryption (CP-HABE). In the scheme, users' identities are encrypted by using access policy and are contained in their transaction. A type of user is defined as the dependable regulation node, which is responsible for the regulation of transactions and encrypted identities. A new signature algorithm instead of the elliptic curve signature is adopted to generate wallet key pairs, this establishes a connection between wallet addresses and encrypted identities. When a transaction is doubted to involve illegal activities, the authorized regulation nodes are capable of revealing the users' real identities and add the illegal identities to a public blacklist.

Order book, consisting of buy and sell orders over time, reflects the intention of the market and is closely related to the evolution of volatility. We propose temporal mixture models capable of adaptively exploiting both volatility history and order book features. By leveraging rolling and incremental learning and evaluation procedures, we demonstrate the prediction performance of our model as well as studying the robustness, in comparison to a variety of statistical and machine learning baselines. Meanwhile, our temporal mixture model enables to decipher the time-varying effect of order book features on volatility. It demonstrates the prospect of our temporal mixture model as an interpretable forecasting framework over heterogeneous Bitcoin data.","[Guo, Tian; Antulov-Fantulin, Nino] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bifet, Albert] Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; Institut Polytechnique de Paris","Guo, T (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.","tian.guo@gess.ethz.ch; albert.bifet@telecom-paristech.fr; nino.antulov@gess.ethz.ch","Bifet, Albert/E-4984-2017","Bifet, Albert/0000-0002-8339-7773","EU Horizon 2020 SoBigData project [654024]","EU Horizon 2020 SoBigData project","The work has been funded by the EU Horizon 2020 SoBigData project under grant agreement No. 654024.","","29","14","14","1","6","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1550-4786","","978-1-5386-9159-5","IEEE DATA MINING","","","2018","","","","","","","989","994","","10.1109/ICDM.2018.00123","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2018.00123","","","6","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BM5BB","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000464691700109","View Full Record in Web of Science"

To increase its transaction rate and speed, micropayment channel networks have been proposed, however these require to lock funds into specific channels. Moreover, the available space in the blockchain does not allow scaling to a world wide payment system. We propose a new layer that sits in between the blockchain and the payment channels. The new layer addresses the scalability problem by enabling trust-less off-blockchain channel funding. It consists of shared accounts of groups of nodes that flexibly create oneto-one channels for the payment network. The new system allows rapid changes of the allocation of funds to channels and reduces the cost of opening new channels. Instead of one blockchain transaction per channel, each user only needs one transaction to enter a group of nodes - within the group the user can create arbitrary many channels. For a group of 20 users with 100 intra-group channels, the cost of the blockchain transactions is reduced by 90% compared to 100 regular micropayment channels opened on the blockchain. This can be increased further to 96% if Bitcoin introduces Schnorr signatures with signature aggregation.","[Burchert, Conrad; Wattenhofer, Roger] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, ETZ G 83,Gloriastr 35, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Decker, Christian] Blockstream Inc, San Francisco, CA USA","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich","Burchert, C; Wattenhofer, R (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, ETZ G 83,Gloriastr 35, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.","bconrad@ethz.ch; wattenhofer@ethz.ch","","","","","","","27","10","11","0","1","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-319-69084-1; 978-3-319-69083-4","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","10616","","","","","","361","377","","10.1007/978-3-319-69084-1_26","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-69084-1_26","","","17","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR8RR","","Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000672799500026","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Evidence of the massive growth of these digital assets can be seen in the massive spikes in new clients at companies like Coinbase, adding 100,000 users in a 24-hour period, and Binance, which recently expanded its user base by 240,000 users in just one hour. The financial industry and Silicon Valley are not the only groups who have caught the cryptocurrency fever. Malicious actors have discovered that cryptocurrency newbies are unwitting targets that offer a consistent stream of revenue. Through our global network visibility, Cisco has observed many of these attacks originating from bulletproof hosting infrastructures located in the Eastern European region. This area is a hotbed for crypto theft and other computer crimes such as ransomware, botnets, DDoS services and credit card fraud. Some criminals have even extended beyond the digital world by kidnapping and demanding ransoms in Bitcoin, such as the case in the reported kidnapping and ransom of Pavel Lerner. Lerner was a lead analyst at Ukraine-based digital currency exchange, Exmo, who was released by his kidnappers after a $1 million Bitcoin payment was made. The event illustrates the desperate lengths some criminals will go in order to steal cryptocurrency. Joining the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance in 2017, Cisco is committed to protecting these new crypto technologies. Over the past year Cisco researchers have teamed up with the Ukraine Cyber Police to track a Bitcoin phishing operation dubbed the Coinhoarder campaign that has been tied to the theft of tens of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. Credential phishing continues to be one of the biggest security challenges for internet users, and cryptocurrency phishers have found it to be a very lucrative form of attack. In 2017, Chainalysis reported Ethereum phishing as being the number one source of theft in that ecosystem with estimates placing the total amount stolen at $115 million. Google also recently published a research paper stating credential phishing is one of their top security challenges. Cisco has been proactive in detecting phishing domains in predictive fashion to help protect our customers. Additionally, we have been working with security personnel at top cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, such as Blockchain. info and Coinbase, to help protect the cryptocurrency community members from having their tokens stolen.

In a nutshell, these works conclude that Bitcoin is secure if and only if the majority of the mining power is honest. Despite their great impact, however, these works do not address an incisive question asked by positivists and Bitcoin critics, which is fuelled by the fact that Bitcoin indeed works in reality: Why should the real-world system adhere to these assumptions? In this work we employ the machinery from the Rational Protocol Design (RPD) framework by Garay et al. [FOCS 2013] to analyze Bitcoin and address questions such as the above. We show that under the natural class of incentives for the miners' behavior-i.e., rewarding them for adding blocks to the blockchain but having them pay for miningwe can reserve the honest majority assumption as a fallback, or even, depending on the application, completely replace it by the assumption that the miners aim to maximize their revenue. Our results underscore the appropriateness of RPD as a rational cryptography framework for analyzing Bitcoin. Along the way, we devise significant extensions to the original RPD machinery that broaden its applicability to cryptocurrencies, which may be of independent interest.","[Badertscher, Christian; Maurer, Ueli; Tschudi, Daniel] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Garay, Juan] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX USA; [Tschudi, Daniel] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark; [Zikas, Vassilis] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Zikas, Vassilis] IOHK, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Zikas, Vassilis] RPI, Troy, NY USA","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Aarhus University; University of Edinburgh; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute","Badertscher, C (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.","christian.badertscher@inf.ethz.ch; garay@tamu.edu; maurer@inf.ethz.ch; tschudi@cs.au.dk; vassilis.zikas@ed.ac.uk","","Badertscher, Christian/0000-0002-1353-1922; Tschudi, Daniel/0000-0001-6188-1049","","","","","31","15","15","0","1","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-319-78375-8; 978-3-319-78374-1","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","10821","","","","","","34","65","","10.1007/978-3-319-78375-8_2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-78375-8_2","","","32","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO5CB","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000517098700002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Bitcoin was conceived in 2008 as an attempt to alleviate trust in government and banks which was at a low during this period of financial crisis. However, with bitcoin trust does not dissipate, rather it shifts. Trust moves from trust in banks or states to trust in algorithms and encryption software. There is a move from conventional trust in the gold standard-In Gold We Trust-to the trust announced on U.S. currency-In God We Trust-to trust in software and networks- In Digital We Trust. The hyperbole of bitcoin discourse is deemed to be an expression of the Californian Ideology, which itself often conceals a right-wing agenda. The paper analyses the hype behind the celebration of decentralised digital networks. It proposes that a form of network fetishism operates here. The failure of bitcoin as a currency (rather than as a hoarded commodity in an emergent bubble) and as an idea might be attributed to the failure to see how ultra-modern digital networks conceal very traditional consolidation of power and capital. The rise and fall of bitcoin, in terms of its original ambition, serves as a cautionary tale in the digital age-it reveals how ingenious innovations that might challenge power and the consolidation of capital become co-opted and colonised by capital. Finally, the paper offers a discussion of the possible progressive uses of the digital technology bitcoin has facilitated.","[Baldwin, Jon] London Metropolitan Univ, London, England","London Metropolitan University","Baldwin, J (corresponding author), London Metropolitan Univ, London, England.","j.baldwin@londonmet.ac.uk","","","","","","","41","17","18","3","12","PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD","BASINGSTOKE","BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND","","2055-1045","","PALGR COMMUN","Palgr.

Proponents of BTU have suggested to use a type of majority attack to force other Bitcoin miners to adopt BTU. In this paper we model this attack in Uppaal, and analyse how long it will take for an attack to succeed, depending on the share the attacker has of the total network, and the so-called confirmation depth.

Imagine working for a global business organization whose routine tasks are powered by a software protocol instead of being governed by managers and employees. Task assignments and rewards are randomized by the algorithm. Information is not channeled through a hierarchy but recorded transparently and securely on an immutable public ledger called blockchain. Further, the organization decides on design and strategy changes through a democratic voting process involving a previously unseen class of stakeholders called miners. Agreements need to be reached at the organizational level for any proposed protocol changes to be approved and activated. How do DAOs solve the universal problem of organizing with such novel solutions? What are the implications? We use Bitcoin as an example to shed light on how a DAO works in the cryptocurrency industry, where it provides a peer-to-peer, decentralized, and disintermediated payment system that can compete against traditional financial institutions.

The core of Bitcoin, the Blockchain, is the history of all transactions committed by the system. This distributed ledger is similar to a distributed shared register where miners write and read blocks. New blocks in the Blockchain contain the last transactions in the system and are added by miners after a block mining process that consists in solving a difficult cryptographic puzzle. Although, the reward is the main motivation for the mining process in Bitcoin, it also may be an incentive for attacks such as selfish mining. In this paper we propose and theoretically analyze a solution for one of the major problems in Bitcoin: selfish mining or block-withholding attack. This attack is conducted by adversarial miners in order to either earn undue rewards or waste the computational power of honest miners. Contrary to the best to date solution for preventing block-withholding [6], our solution, ZeroBlock, prevents this attack by using a novel timestamp-free technique that exploits the Poisson nature of the proof-of-work and the current knowledge on the propagation of information in Bitcoin [2]. Note that previous solutions are vulnerable to forgeable timestamps. Additionally, our solution is compliant with miners churn.","[Solat, Siamak; Potop-Butucaru, Maria] Sorbonne Univ, UMR, LIP6, UPMC CNRS, F-7606 Paris, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite","Solat, S (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, UMR, LIP6, UPMC CNRS, F-7606 Paris, France.","Siamak.Solat@lip6.fr; Maria.Potop-Butucaru@lip6.fr","","","","","","","9","1","1","0","1","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-319-69084-1; 978-3-319-69083-4","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","10616","","","","","","356","360","","10.1007/978-3-319-69084-1_25","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-69084-1_25","","","5","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR8RR","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000672799500025","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this regard, it seems extremely urgent to solve the problem that reveals the features of the development of the market under study, as well as the possibility of its forecasting for the medium and long periods of time. The aim of the work is to find and scientifically substantiate the tools and mechanisms for developing predictive assessments of the development of the crypto-currency market. The process of economic and mathematical modeling of time series characterizing the volatility of the bitcoin exchange rate, based on the use of the ARMA class of autoregressive moving average models is the subject of the study.

Indeed Bitcoin mining and transactions are an application of Blockchain technology employing an inefficient use of scarce energy resources for a financial activity at a point in human development where world governments are scrambling to reduce energy consumption through their Paris Agreement climate change commitments and beyond to mitigate future climate change implications. Without encouraging more sustainable development of the potential applications of Blockchain technologies which can have significant social and economic benefits, their resource-intensive design combined now pose a serious threat to the global commitment to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The article examines government intervention choices to desocialise negative environmental externalities caused by high-energy consuming Blockchain technology designs. The research question explores how to promote the environmentally sustainable development of applications of Blockchain without damaging this valuable sector. It studies existing regulatory and fiscal policy approaches towards digital currencies in order to provide a basis for further legal and policy tools targeted at mitigating energy consumption of Blockchain technologies. The article concludes by identifying appropriate fiscal policy options for this purpose, as well as further considerations on the potential for Blockchain technology in climate change mitigation.","[Truby, Jon] Qatar Univ, Coll Law, Ctr Law & Dev, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar","Qatar University","Truby, J (corresponding author), Qatar Univ, Coll Law, Ctr Law & Dev, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar.","jon.truby@qu.edu.qa","TRUBY, JON/AAJ-2754-2020","TRUBY, JON/0000-0002-9184-7033","","","","","115","126","128","39","299","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","2214-6296","2214-6326","","ENERGY RES SOC SCI","Energy Res.

One particular area at risk is cryptocurrencies, a market currently worth over 100 billion USD. We investigate the risk posed to Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, by attacks using quantum computers. We find that the proof-of-work used by Bitcoin is relatively resistant to substantial speedup by quantum computers in the next 10 years, mainly because specialized ASIC miners are extremely fast compared to the estimated clock speed of near-term quantum computers. On the other hand, the elliptic curve signature scheme used by Bitcoin is much more at risk, and could be completely broken by a quantum computer as early as 2027, by the most optimistic estimates. We analyze an alternative proof-of-work called Momentum, based on finding collisions in a hash function, that is even more resistant to speedup by a quantum computer. We also review the available post-quantum signature schemes to see which one would best meet the security and efficiency requirements of blockchain applications.","[Aggarwal, Divesh] NUS, Dept Comp Sci, Singapore, Singapore; [Aggarwal, Divesh; Santha, Miklos] NUS, Ctr Quantum Technol, Singapore, Singapore; [Brennen, Gavin] Macquarie Univ, N Ryde, NSW, Australia; [Lee, Troy] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Santha, Miklos] Univ Paris Diderot, CNRS, IRIF, Paris, France; [Tomamichel, Marco] Univ Technol Sydney, Quantum Informat, Sydney, NSW, Australia","National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; Macquarie University; University of Technology Sydney; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; University of Technology Sydney","Aggarwal, D (corresponding author), NUS, Dept Comp Sci, Singapore, Singapore.;Aggarwal, D (corresponding author), NUS, Ctr Quantum Technol, Singapore, Singapore.","dcsdiva@nus.edu.sg; gavin.brennen@mq.edu.au; troyjlee@gmail.com; miklos.santha@gmail.com; marco.tomamichel@uts.edu.au","Tomamichel, Marco/D-5441-2013; Brennen, Gavin/C-2293-2009","Tomamichel, Marco/0000-0001-5410-3329; Brennen, Gavin/0000-0002-6019-966X","Singapore National Research Foundation [NRF-NRFF2013-13]; Singapore Ministry of Education; National Research Foundation [R-710-000-012-135]; QuantERA ERA-NET Cofund project QuantAlgo","Singapore National Research Foundation(National Research Foundation, Singapore); Singapore Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, Singapore); National Research Foundation; QuantERA ERA-NET Cofund project QuantAlgo","MT and GB would like to thank Michael Bremner for initial discussions.

Pseudo-anonymous, decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash systems such as Bitcoin have caused a paradigm shift in the way that people conduct financial transactions and purchase goods. Although cryptocurrencies enable users to securely and anonymously exchange money, they can also facilitate illegal criminal activities. Therefore, it is imperative that law enforcement agencies develop appropriate analytical processes that will allow them to identify and investigate criminal activities in the Blockchain (a distributed ledger). In this paper, INTERPOL, through the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation, proposes a Bitcoin analytical framework and a software system that will assist law enforcement agencies in the real-time analysis of the Blockchain while providing digital crime analysts with tracing and visualization capabilities. By doing so, it is feasible to render transactions decipherable and comprehensible for law enforcement investigators and prosecutors.

The proposed model allows us to quickly collect information about identities owning Bitcoin addresses and to recover measures and statistics on the Bitcoin network. By exploiting algebraic formalism, we reconstructed an Entities network associated to Blockchain transactions gathering together Bitcoin addresses into the single entity holding permits to manage Bitcoins held by those addresses. The model allows also to identify a set of behaviors typical of Bitcoin owners, like that of using an address only once, and to reconstruct chains for this behavior together with the rate of firing.

However, the existing works analyze the transaction history in a static manner and none of them analyzes transaction history dynamically, i.e. without taking into account the time variation of how Bitcoin is transferred. The time analysis is in great demand for many practical cases, such as digital forensics tool that infers what was going on behind the scene of a fraudulent scam, and real-time inference of marketplace sales. In this paper, we propose a novel time series analysis for analyzing the history of Bitcoin transactions. In fact the main goal of our research is to detect changing points, namely anomaly detection, against a given (Bitcoin) address's transaction history. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, it is tested against the transaction history of Pirate@40's HYIP (High Yielding Investment Program) scheme, which raised 700,000 BTC from his investors and was charged by the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2013. It is shown that the proposed approach can successfully detect several remarkable points of Pirate@40's HYIP scheme, such as when its program's name was changed to Bitcoin Saving & Trust and when its investment rule was changed.","[Toyoda, Kentaroh; Ohtsuki, Tomoaki] Keio Univ, Dept Informat & Comp Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Mathiopoulos, Takis] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Athens, Greece","Keio University; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens","Toyoda, K (corresponding author), Keio Univ, Dept Informat & Comp Sci, Tokyo, Japan.","toyoda@ohtsuki.ics.keio.ac.jp","Ohtsuki, Tomoaki/D-7179-2014; Toyoda, Kentaroh/U-3230-2019; Mathiopoulos, P.

Bitcoin is known for resolving double-spending problems. When two or more miners generate a block that includes transaction information at nearly the same time, an accidental fork occurs. In this case, the longest chain of blocks is selected to avoid the double-spending problem. However, if there is an attacker node whose hash power is greater than half of the total hash power, that node can perform a double-spending attack, i.e., a 51% or majority attack. We propose a random mining group selection technique to reduce the probability of successful double-spending attacks. The analysis results demonstrate that if the number of groups is greater than or equal to two, the probability that the attacker will find the next block is less than 50%.","[Bae, Jaewon; Lim, Hyuk] GIST, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci EECS, Gwangju, South Korea","Gwangju Institute of Science & Technology (GIST)","Bae, J (corresponding author), GIST, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci EECS, Gwangju, South Korea.","jaewonbae@gist.ac.kr; hlim@gist.ac.kr","Lim, Hyuk/C-9928-2010","Lim, Hyuk/0000-0002-9926-3913","IITP - Korea government (MSIT) [2017-0-00421]; GRI - GIST","IITP - Korea government (MSIT); GRI - GIST","This work was supported by IITP grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2017-0-00421, Cyber Security Defense Cycle Mechanism for New Security Threats), and by GRI grant funded by the GIST in 2018.","","8","22","22","0","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2325-6648","2325-6664","978-1-5386-6553-4","I C DEPENDABLE SYST","","","2018","","","","","","","81","82","","10.1109/DSN-W.2018.00040","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DSN-W.2018.00040","","","2","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BO0ZU","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000494277000028","View Full Record in Web of Science"

On the Bitcoin Blockchain, an entity's real-world identity is hidden behind a pseudonym, a so-called address. Therefore, Bitcoin is widely assumed to provide a high degree of anonymity, which is a driver for its frequent use for illicit activities. This paper presents a novel approach for reducing the anonymity of the Bitcoin Blockchain by using Supervised Machine Learning to predict the type of yet-unidentified entities. We utilised a sample of 434 entities (with approximate to 200 million transactions), whose identity and type had been revealed, as training set data and built classifiers differentiating among 10 categories. Our main finding is that we can indeed predict the type of a yet-unidentified entity. Using the Gradient Boosting algorithm, we achieve an accuracy of 77% and F1-score of approximate to 0.75. We discuss our novel approach of Supervised Machine Learning for uncovering Bitcoin Blockchain anonymity and its potential applications to forensics and financial compliance and its societal implications, outline study limitations and propose future research directions.","[Harlev, Mikkel Alexander; Yin, Haohua Sun; Langenheldt, Klaus Christian; Mukkamala, Raghava Rao; Vatrapu, Ravi] Copenhagen Business Sch, Ctr Business Data Analyt, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Mukkamala, Raghava Rao; Vatrapu, Ravi] Westerdals Oslo Sch Arts Comm & Tech, Oslo, Norway","Copenhagen Business School; Westerdals Oslo School of Arts Communication & Technology","Harlev, MA (corresponding author), Copenhagen Business Sch, Ctr Business Data Analyt, Copenhagen, Denmark.","miharlev@gmail.com; awasunyin@gmail.com; klangenheldt@gmail.com; rrm.itm@cbs.dk; rv.itm@cbs.dk","Mukkamala, Raghava Rao/AAV-7667-2021","Mukkamala, Raghava Rao/0000-0001-9814-3883","","","","","32","39","42","1","1","HICSS","Honolulu","Dept IT Mgmt, Shidler College of Business, Univ Hawaii at Manoa 2404 Maile Way D307, Honolulu, Hawaii, UNITED STATES","","","978-0-9981331-1-9","","","","2018","","","","","","","3497","3506","","","","","","10","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BQ9JN","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000625208503071","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We find that these 52 cryptocurrencies are tightly interconnected and mega-cap cryptocurrencies are more likely to propagate volatility shocks to others.

However, beyond this original purpose, blockchains also irrevocably record arbitrary data, ranging from short messages to pictures. This does not come without risk for users as each participant has to locally replicate the complete blockchain, particularly including potentially harmful content. We provide the first systematic analysis of the benefits and threats of arbitrary blockchain content. Our analysis shows that certain content, e.g., illegal pornography, can render the mere possession of a blockchain illegal. Based on these insights, we conduct a thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis of unintended content on Bitcoin's blockchain. Although most data originates from benign extensions to Bitcoin's protocol, our analysis reveals more than 1600 files on the blockchain, over 99% of which are texts or images. Among these files there is clearly objectionable content such as links to child pornography, which is distributed to all Bitcoin participants. With our analysis, we thus highlight the importance for future blockchain designs to address the possibility of unintended data insertion and protect blockchain users accordingly.","[Matzutt, Roman; Hiller, Jens; Henze, Martin; Ziegeldorf, Jan Henrik; Hohlfeld, Oliver; Wehrle, Klaus] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Commun & Distributed Syst, Aachen, Germany; [Muellmann, Dirk] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Data Protect Res Inst, Frankfurt, Germany","RWTH Aachen University; Goethe University Frankfurt","Matzutt, R (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Commun & Distributed Syst, Aachen, Germany.","matzutt@comsys.rwth-aachen.de; hiller@comsys.rwth-aachen.de; henze@comsys.rwth-aachen.de; ziegeldorf@comsys.rwth-aachen.de; muellmann@jur.uni-frankfurt.de; hohlfeld@comsys.rwth-aachen.de; wehrle@comsys.rwth-aachen.de","Matzutt, Roman/N-7654-2019; Henze, Martin/I-3623-2014","Matzutt, Roman/0000-0002-4263-5317; Henze, Martin/0000-0001-8717-2523; Hiller, Jens/0000-0001-9067-8410; Wehrle, Klaus/0000-0001-7252-4186","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [16KIS0443]","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","This work has been funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under funding reference number 16KIS0443.

After that, the attackers' strategy has been further discussed by many other works, which analyze the strategy and behavior of a single attacker. The extension of the strategy research is greatly restricted by the assumption that there is only one attacker in the blockchain network, since, in many cases, a proof of work blockchain has multiple attackers. The attackers can be independent of others instead of sharing information and attacking the blockchain as a whole. In this paper, we will establish a new model to analyze the miners' behavior in a proof of work blockchain with multiple attackers. Based on our model, we extend the attackers' strategy by proposing a new strategy set publish-n. Meanwhile, we will also review other attacking strategies such as selfish mining and stubborn mining in our model to explore whether these strategies work or not when there are multiple attackers.

The findings are compared to the stylized facts of mature world markets. While early trading was affected by system-specific irregularities, it is found that over the months preceding April 2018 all these statistical indicators approach the features hallmarking maturity. This can be taken as an indication that the Bitcoin market, and possibly other cryptocurrencies, carry concrete potential of imminently becoming a regular market, alternative to the foreign exchange. Since high-frequency price data are available since the beginning of trading, the Bitcoin offers a unique window into the statistical characteristics of a market maturation trajectory.

Generally, free-riders are the users in the file sharing network who avoid contributing any resources but tend to consume the resources unethically from the P2P network whereas white-washers are more specific category of free-riders that voluntarily leave the system in a frequent fashion and appearing again and again with different identities to escape from the penal actions imposed by the network. BitTorrent being a collaborative distributed platform requires techniques for discouraging and punishing such user behavior. In this paper, we propose that Instead of punishing, we may focus more on rewarding the honest peers. This approach could be presented as an alternative to other mechanisms of rewarding the peers like tit-for-tat [10], reciprocity based etc., built for the BitTorrent platform. The prime objective of BitTrusty is: providing incentives to the cooperative peers by rewarding in terms of cryptocoins based on blockchain. We have anticipated three ways of achieving the above defined objective. We are further investigating on how to integrate these two technologies of distributed systems viz. P2P file sharing systems and blockchain, and with this new paradigm, interesting research areas can be further developed, both in the field of P2P cryptocurrency networks and also when these networks are combined with other distributed scenarios.","[Pant, Shruti; Kumar, Vishal] Bipin Tripathi Kumaon Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci Engn, Dwarahat, Uttarakhand, India","Bipin Tripathi Kumaon Institute of Technology","Pant, S (corresponding author), Bipin Tripathi Kumaon Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci Engn, Dwarahat, Uttarakhand, India.","shruti.panth7@gmail.com; vishalkumar@kecua.ac.in","Kumar, Vishal/AAQ-1095-2021; KUMAR, VISHAL/AAB-7692-2022","Kumar, Vishal/0000-0002-5842-4944; ","","","","","23","0","0","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-6227-4","","","","2018","","","","","","","148","155","","","","","","8","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BM0UQ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000459208100028","View Full Record in Web of Science"

McCorry et al. (FC 2016) showed that BIP70 is prone to refund attacks and proposed a fix that requires the customer to sign their refund request. They argued that this minimal change will provide resistance against refund attacks. In this paper, we point out the drawbacks of McCorry et al.'s fix and propose a new approach for protection against refund attacks using the Bitcoin multisignature mechanism. Our solution does not rely on merchants storing refund requests, and unlike the previous solution, allows updating refund addresses through email. We discuss the security of our proposed method and compare it with the previous solution. We also propose a novel application of our refund mechanism in providing anonymity for payments between a payer and payee in which merchants act as mixing servers. We finally discuss how to combine the above two mechanisms in a single payment protocol to have an anonymous payment protocol secure against refund attacks.","[Avizheh, Sepideh; Safavi-Naini, Reihaneh] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Shahandashti, Siamak F.] Univ York, York, N Yorkshire, England","University of Calgary; University of York - UK","Avizheh, S (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.","sepideh.avizheh1@ucalgary.ca","","","","","","","18","1","1","0","4","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-662-58387-6; 978-3-662-58386-9","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","10957","","","","","","369","387","","10.1007/978-3-662-58387-6_20","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-58387-6_20","","","19","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP1RW","","Green Submitted, Green Accepted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000540656400020","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This article assesses the effectiveness of the global anti-money laundering regime in balancing both the challenges and opportunities presented by these novel 'altcoins'. Two main arguments are advanced. First, the implications that crypto-coins presently pose for global anti-money laundering efforts stem less from the threats of their illicit uses as digital currencies and more from the opportunities presented by their underlying blockchain technologies. Second, despite several shortcomings, the risk-based approach pursued by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) strikes an effective balance between the existing threats and opportunities that crypto-coins currently present. Rather than a conclusive evaluation however this article stresses the need for continual monitoring and investigation of the wider ethical implications raised by CCs for global efforts to combat money laundering in an era of rapid technological change.","[Campbell-Verduyn, Malcolm] Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, 67 Erb St West,Off Room 336, Waterloo, ON N2L 6C2, Canada","University of Waterloo","Campbell-Verduyn, M (corresponding author), Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, 67 Erb St West,Off Room 336, Waterloo, ON N2L 6C2, Canada.","mcverduyn@balsillieschool.ca","","Campbell-Verduyn, Malcolm/0000-0003-1081-5417","","","","","157","38","39","4","131","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0925-4994","1573-0751","","CRIME LAW SOCIAL CH","Crime Law Soc.

The reviews may influence the decision of customers buying the product since E-commerce websites/services do not allow customers to validate and inspect products in-store. In this paper, we analyze data from two BITCOIN marketplaces which include transactions between marketplace users and the ratings of those transactions given by those users. In this analysis we create a synthetic network model with similar topological properties as the networks of the interactions of both marketplaces. The results of our analysis show an interesting phenomenon in which user ratings, which range from -10 to 10, converge to a value of approximately two as the number of a user's transactions increase. Finally, we suggest future work on our synthetic model to improve its agreement with the transaction networks in order to better understand how reviews influence user decisions on transactions.","[Aw, Ee Hong; Gera, Ralucca; Hicks, Kenneth] US Navy, Postgrad Sch, Dept Appl Math, Monterey, CA 93943 USA; [Koeppen, Nicholas] US Navy, Postgrad Sch, Mech & Aerosp Engn, Monterey, CA USA; [Teska, Christopher] US Navy, Postgrad Sch, Dept Oprat Res, Monterey, CA USA","United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Postgraduate School; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Postgraduate School; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Postgraduate School","Aw, EH (corresponding author), US Navy, Postgrad Sch, Dept Appl Math, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.","eaw@nps.edu; rgera@nps.edu; kahicks1@nps.edu; nrkoeppe@nps.edu; cjteska@nps.edu","","","DoD","DoD(United States Department of Defense)","The authors thank the DoD for partially sponsoring the current research.","","19","1","1","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-6051-5","","","","2018","","","","","","","1242","1249","","","","","","8","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BL7UA","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000455640600207","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Sub-trees corresponding to the sub-data sets are generated and analysed in parallel via multiple threads of execution running over multiple cores of multiple processors.

Research has found that, when faced with stigma, the most effective and robust strategy for established nondigital firms is to try to and create a distance from it. Open entrepreneurs with different ideologies would likely benefit from similar actions; however, the interdependencies created when they rely upon a digital infrastructure may make this strategy impossible. Given the tensions between ideological heterogeneity and a shared infrastructure, howand whydo open entrepreneurs respond to stigma? This paper extends existing literature on stigma by developing a model of ideologically mediated responses to stigma by open entrepreneurs through an inductive study based upon interviews, archival, and forum data. We further contribute to extant literature on open entrepreneurship by proposing a model of ideologically mediated responses to stigma, which is grounded in group identity theory. We also build on digital infrastructure literature by proposing the concept of digital infrastructure anchoring. Lastly, we show how ideological heterogeneity leads to business model heterogeneity among open entrepreneurs and discuss the practical implications of this research.","[Bogusz, Claire Ingram] Stockholm Sch Econ, Ctr Strategy & Competitiveness, Box 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Morisse, Marcel] Univ Hamburg, Dept Informat, Vogt Kolln Str 30, D-22527 Hamburg, Germany","Stockholm School of Economics; University of Hamburg","Bogusz, CI (corresponding author), Stockholm Sch Econ, Ctr Strategy & Competitiveness, Box 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden.","claire.ingram@hhs.se","Ingram Bogusz, Claire/Q-5402-2016","Ingram Bogusz, Claire/0000-0001-9160-347X; Morisse, Marcel/0000-0002-3777-4638","Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation","Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation","Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation","","132","14","14","5","34","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1350-1917","1365-2575","","INFORM SYST J","Inf.

Traditional architecture which relies on centralized cloud storage is depressingly beset by the security problems such as incomplete confidence and unreliable regulation. Moreover, an expensive, inefficient and incompatible design impedes the effort of evidence preservation. In contrast, the decentralized blockchain network is qualified as a perfect replacement for its secure anonymity, irrevocable commitment, and transparent traceability. Combining with subliminal channels in blockchain, we have weaved the transaction network with newly designed evidence audit network. In this paper, we have presented and implemented a lightweight digital evidence-preservation architecture which possesses the features of privacy-anonymity, audit-transparency, function-scalability and operation-lightweight. The anonymity is naturally formed from the cryptographic design, since the cipher evidence under encrypted cryptosystem and hash-based functions leakages nothing to the public. Covert channels are efficiently excavated to optimize the cost, connectivity and security of the framework, transforming the great computation power of Bitcoin network to the value of credit. The transparency used for audit, which relates to the proof of existence, comes from instant timestamps and irreversible hash functions in mature blockchain network. The scalability is represented by the evidence chain interacted with the original blockchain, and the extended chains on top of mainchain will cover the most of auditors in different institutions. And the lightweight, which is equal to low-cost, is derived from our fine-grained hierarchical services.

Complicating the issue are emerging technologies that threaten to blackbox and obscure the function of voting systems. In addition to discussing the longstanding issue of trust in voting technology, this article provides a review of useful macro-scale concepts for practitioners to consider when working on projects related to electoral systems. Method: After providing a synthesis and overview of the broad principles of electoral integrity, I overview blockchain (the technology underlying Bitcoin), discuss its possible application to voting systems, and consider its implications for the broader goal of fostering voter trust and legitimacy. Results: Technologies such as blockchain have the potential to not only change the mechanics of voting but to change the very definitions of transparent and trustworthy as applied to election systems. Conclusion: Trust in elections systems is ultimately a rhetorical, rather than technical, effect. As technical communicators are increasingly called upon to unblackbox election technologies, they must remain attentive to the potentially shifting values that define trustworthiness for the electorate at certain historical moments.","[Nugent, Jim] Oakland Univ, Major Writing & Rhetor, Rochester, MI 48063 USA","Oakland University","Nugent, J (corresponding author), Oakland Univ, Major Writing & Rhetor, Rochester, MI 48063 USA.","nugent@oakland.edu","","","","","","","41","1","1","0","4","SOC TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION","FAIRFAX","9401 LEE HIGHWAY, STE 300, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA","0049-3155","","","TECH COMMUN-STC","Tech.

We find that S&P 500 realized volatility has a negative and highly significant effect on long-term Bitcoin volatility. The finding is atypical for volatility co-movements across financial markets. Moreover, we find that the S&P 500 volatility risk premium has a significantly positive effect on long-term Bitcoin volatility. Finally, we find a strong positive association between the Baltic dry index and long-term Bitcoin volatility. This result shows that Bitcoin volatility is closely linked to global economic activity.

Global economic trade is often argued to be as old as trade. The question of the nature of the exchange, of who creates the value and how it is regulated is the issue. While tin from England may have reached Sumeria 4 000 years ago, or Phoenicians' ships entered the Africa area of Cape Palmas at about the same time, the problem of exchange is a central issue. Ideas of money are as diverse as the cultures that produce them, yet today global trade is experiencing modifications of the satisfaction of exchange with new platforms of electronic money. Blockchain technology is touted as foolproof, such claims have appeared in the past with various financial innovations. Such abstractions of value may not be new, but as a product of technology and complexity they create psychological novelty and a form of mesmerizing fetishism (Douglas, M. and Isherwood, B., ed.: The World of Goods: Towards an Anthropology of Consumption. Routledge, London, 1978). Manias of value are also not new, from stock (South Seas Corporation) to tulips (MacKay, C.: Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. Crown Press, London, 1841). The form of the mania is defined and expressed culturally but is often associated with technological change and distance of exchange of partners and clients (Baric, L.: Some aspects of credit, saving and investment in a 'non-monetary' economy (Rossel Island). In: Firth, R. and Yamey, B. S., eds.: Capital, Saving and Credit in Peasant Societies. Aldine Publishing, Chicago, pp. 35-52, 1964.). Inequality is also a feature, embedded in economic and technological disruption of trade and exchange. The role of redistribution and taxation are essential in maintaining social credit and equality. We can relate such behaviour to other systems of animal societies.","[Caldararo, Niccolo] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Anthropol, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA","California State University System; San Francisco State University","Caldararo, N (corresponding author), San Francisco State Univ, Coll Liberal & Creat Arts, Anthropol Dept, 1600 Holloway Ave SCI 377, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.","cald@sfsu.edu","","","","","","","96","2","2","1","9","CROATIAN INTERDISCIPLINARY SOC","SESVETE","SIMUNCEVECKA 38B, SESVETE, HR-10360, CROATIA","1334-4684","1334-4676","","INTERDISCIP DESCR CO","Interdiscip.

Based on this, the countermeasures for China to strengthen bitcoin supervision are put forward. The results showed that the factors for different supervision ideas are various. For the macro level, it includes social system; and for the micro level, it involves consumer's consumption concept.

The Bitcoin, for example, has several characteristics, which make it alternative money. The number of Bitcoins is limited (by design) to 21 million. In this respect Bitcoin is similar to gold. In addition, it is extremely easy to transfer Bitcoins between any locations in the world, at high speed and at very low cost. This paper looks at Bitcoin from the central bank's perspective. Taking into consideration central bank's goals and functions, possible consequences of Bitcoin usage are discussed. It is shown, that any purchase of Bitcoins in no way could increase inflation. To the contrary, it may tend to support deflation. What concerns financial stability: Bitcoin does not yet have the scale to act as a systemic contagion of instability or lapse in network integrity. But the real problem could be substantial involvement of financial institutions in cryptocurrencies. From a central bank's perspective this might be quite dangerous and should be limited by law. If Bitcoin begins to undermine the financial and tax systems they will be shut down and all contracts between traders would be unenforceable.","[Karwowski, Jacek] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland","Wroclaw University of Economics & Business","Karwowski, J (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.","jacek.karwowski@ue.wroc.pl","Karwowski, Jacek/P-2738-2018","Karwowski, Jacek/0000-0003-2754-5003","","","","","15","0","0","1","4","INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA","NORRISTOWN","34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA","","","978-0-9998551-1-9","","","","2018","","","","","","","848","857","","","","","","10","Business; Economics","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics","BO2TA","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000508553201031","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Blockchain is pushing forward a race of transaction-based applications with trust establishment without the need for a centralised authority, promoting accountability and transparency within the business process. However, a blockchain ledger (e.g., Bitcoin) tend to become very complex and specialised tools, collectively called Blockchain Analytics, are required to allow individuals, law enforcement agencies and service providers to search, explore and visualise it. Over the last years, several analytical tools have been developed with capabilities that allow, e.g., to map relationships, examine flow of transactions and filter crime instances as a way to enhance forensic investigations.

In this paper, we measure the return risk of VFAs based on GARCH-type model. By establishing a Markov regime-switching Regression (MSR) Model, we explore the asymmetric effects of speculation, investor attention, and market interoperability on return risks in different risk regimes of VFAs. The results show that the influences of speculation and investor attention on the risks of VFAs are significantly positive at all regimes, while market interoperability only admits a positive impact on risk under high risk regime. All of the three factors exert asymmetric effects on risks in different regimes. Further study presents that the risk regime-switching also shows asymmetric characteristic but the medium risk regime is more stable than any others. Therefore, transactions of investors and arbitrageurs are monitored by certain policies, such as limiting the number of transactions or restricting the trading amount at high risk regime. However, when return risk is low, it will return to a medium level if we encourage investors to access.","[Li, Zhenghui; Huang, Zhehao] Guangzhou Int Inst Finance, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhenghui; Huang, Zhehao] Guangzhou Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Dong, Hao] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Stat, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Failler, Pierre] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Dept Econ & Finance, Portsmouth P01 3DE, Hants, England","Guangzhou University; Guangzhou University; University of Portsmouth","Huang, ZH (corresponding author), Guangzhou Int Inst Finance, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Huang, ZH (corresponding author), Guangzhou Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.","zhehao.h@gzhu.edu.cn","","failler, pierre/0000-0002-9225-9399; Li, Zhenghui/0000-0002-7344-9912","Guangdong Natural Science Foundation [2018A030313115]","Guangdong Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province)","The work was supported by Guangdong Natural Science Foundation (No. 2018A030313115).","","42","48","48","0","10","AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS","SPRINGFIELD","PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA","2573-0134","","","QUANT FINANC ECON","Quant.

The core objective of this empirical inquiry is to look into the adoption of cryptocurrencies particularly Bitcoin, among the people of mainland China. To carry out the goals, this study was conducted to collect the essential information by applying a structured questionnaire from the people of mainland China via the online data collection system. The sample size is (n = 376) therefore, descriptive statistics, and structural equation modeling (SEM) has been applied to explore the causal relationship between explanatory factors and citizens intention to use. This study proposes that awareness and perceived trustworthiness are comparatively significant factors to determine the intention to use Bitcoin, while perceived usefulness partially mediates the relationship between perceived ease of use and intention to use. This study explores the factors influencing Bitcoin adoption in China demonstrating similarities and differences in terms of global adoption. The outcomes contribute to existing theories of Bitcoin adoption, providing policymakers with insight into how adoption is unfolding in this context.","[Shahzad, Fakhar; Xiu, GuoYi; Wang, Jian; Shahbaz, Muhammad] Harbin Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China","Harbin University of Science & Technology","Shahzad, F (corresponding author), Harbin Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.","fshahzad51@yahoo.com; xiugy@126.com; wjian1820@163.com; shahbaz755@yahoo.com","Shahzad, Fakhar/F-7336-2012; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAS-6190-2021; Wang, Jian/GPP-0722-2022","Shahzad, Fakhar/0000-0002-6408-2848; Shahbaz, Muhammad/0000-0003-2391-6997; Wang, Jian/0000-0003-3406-905X; Xiu, Guoyi/0000-0001-5907-4053","","","","","77","67","66","5","38","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0160-791X","1879-3274","","TECHNOL SOC","Technol.

Proof of Work (PoW) is at the heart of blockchain's security, asset generation, and maintenance. Although simple and secure, a hash-based PoW like Bitcoin's puzzle is often referred to as useless, and the used intensive computations are considered waste of energy. A myriad of Proof of something alternatives have been proposed to mitigate energy consumption; however, they either introduced new security threats and limitations, or the work remained far from being really useful. In this work, we introduce Proof of eXercise (PoX): a sustainable alternative to PoW where an eXercise is a real world matrix-based scientific computation problem. We provide a novel study of the properties of Bitcoin's PoW, the challenges of a more rational solution as PoX, and we suggest a comprehensive approach for PoX.","[Shoker, Ali] INESC TEC, HASLab, Porto, Portugal; [Shoker, Ali] Minho Univ, Braga, Portugal","INESC TEC; Universidade do Minho","Shoker, A (corresponding author), INESC TEC, HASLab, Porto, Portugal.;Shoker, A (corresponding author), Minho Univ, Braga, Portugal.","ali.shoker@inesctec.pt","Shoker, Ali/F-6882-2015","Shoker, Ali/0000-0002-4898-9394","European Union's Horizon 2020 - The EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2014-2020 [732505]; North Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement [NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000020]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)","European Union's Horizon 2020 - The EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2014-2020; North Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Commission)","The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 - The EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2014-2020, under grant agreement No. 732505.

In addition, several financial instruments providing investors an opportunity to participate in digital currencies, particularly bitcoins investments, have been introduced recently, which can been traded at stock exchanges. This article seeks to highlight this asset class as well as discuss certain aspects of taxation for such investments according to the German Income Tax Act. In the first step, digital currencies are classified within the scope of traditional and alternative asset classes, and the current investment opportunities at the stock exchange will be described. Based on these findings, the article focusses on the several special aspects of German tax resulting from the many opportunities to structure the investment.

By providing a persistent, distributed, and append-only ledger, blockchains enable numerous applications such as distributed consensus, robustness against equivocation, and smart contracts. However, recent studies show that blockchain systems such as Bitcoin can be (mis)used to store arbitrary content. This has already been used to store arguably objectionable content on Bitcoin's blockchain. Already single instances of clearly objectionable or even illegal content can put the whole system at risk by making its node operators culpable. To overcome this imminent risk, we survey and discuss the design space of countermeasures against the insertion of such objectionable content. Our analysis shows a wide spectrum of potential countermeasures, which are often combinable for increased efficiency. First, we investigate special-purpose content detectors as an ad hoc mitigation. As they turn out to be easily evadable, we also investigate content-agnostic countermeasures. We find that mandatory minimum fees as well as mitigation of transaction manipulability via identifier commitments significantly raise the bar for inserting harmful content into a blockchain.","[Matzutt, Roman; Henze, Martin; Ziegeldorf, Jan Henrik; Hiller, Jens; Wehrle, Klaus] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Commun & Distributed Syst, Aachen, Germany","RWTH Aachen University","Matzutt, R (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Commun & Distributed Syst, Aachen, Germany.","matzutt@comsys.rwth-aachen.de; henze@comsys.rwth-aachen.de; ziegeldorf@comsys.rwth-aachen.de; hiller@comsys.rwth-aachen.de; wehrle@comsys.rwth-aachen.de","Henze, Martin/I-3623-2014","Henze, Martin/0000-0001-8717-2523; Wehrle, Klaus/0000-0001-7252-4186; Matzutt, Roman/0000-0002-4263-5317; Hiller, Jens/0000-0001-9067-8410","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [16KIS0443]","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","This work has been funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under funding reference number 16KIS0443.

Because of their decentralized control, they are often considered a threat or alternative to the conventional centralized banking system. While the technological implication of some such currencies, especially of Bitcoin, has attracted much attention, so far there is little discussion about the entire field of cryptocurrencies and very little academic literature addressing its ethical significance. In this article, we thus address the impact of blockchain technology on the nature of financial transactions from a business ethics perspective. We begin with a survey on relevant literature from neighboring disciplines. Next, we work towards a 3x3 framework for current debates on the ethics of cryptocurrencies (see Table1): we combine the micro, meso, and macro levels of business and society with assessments of the potential ethical impact of cryptocurrencies as morally beneficial, detrimental, and ambiguous. In addition, we highlight possible avenues for future research, such as the changing roles of the miners and regulators, the prosocial use of cryptocurrencies, the antisocial use for shadow banking and transactions in the dark net' and cryptocurrencies' effect on inflation and deflation.","[Dierksmeier, Claus] Univ Tubingen, Weltethos Inst, Hintere Grabenstr 26, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Seele, Peter] USI, Corp Social Responsibil & Business Eth, Via G Buffi 13, CH-6904 Lugano, TI, Switzerland","Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Universita della Svizzera Italiana","Dierksmeier, C (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Weltethos Inst, Hintere Grabenstr 26, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.","clausdierksmeier@gmail.com; peter.seele@usi.ch","Dierksmeier, Claus/AAF-5563-2019","Dierksmeier, Claus/0000-0002-8760-9972; Seele, Peter/0000-0002-6456-4003","","","","","70","75","76","5","119","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0167-4544","1573-0697","","J BUS ETHICS","J.

While all computer systems are continuously under attack, those who operate conventional distributed network systems stand a far greater chance of being able to demonstrate compliance than those who use cloud based systems. The main reason for this discrepancy between the two approaches is down to the as yet unsolved cloud forensic problem, meaning many cloud users will be completely unable to demonstrate compliance with the new regulation, thus exposing themselves to potentially massive fines after 25th May. We consider the possible use of a crypto-currency based mechanism to address the as yet unsolved cloud forensic problem. Crypto-currencies are becoming a global phenomenon, gaining more attention from media, venture capitalists, financial and government institutions. We focus on the operational risk and the market risk related to crypto-currencies, especially the dominating Bitcoin. Operational risk encompasses the actions that undermine the technological infrastructure and security assumptions of crypto-currencies. We discuss how blockchain technology could improve the efficiency of financial infrastructures, as well as the inevitable vulnerabilities of operational risk of software, open-source governance, and code maintenance. We summarise the literature findings on the co-movement of cryptocurrencies with different currencies, indices, and commodities, to show the role of crypto-currency as a commodity, currency, or a speculative investment under portfolio diversification theory. Particularly now that we have seen successful attacks on cryptocurrencies in action, it is important to understand where these weaknesses lie, and to endeavour to find out to what extent the use of such technology might expose companies using this technology for GDPR compliance. In the light of the robustness of this approach, we consider whether the underlying blockchain technology could, in turn, be practically applied to addressing the cloud forensic problem. This paper looks at the pros and cons of the blockchain/bitcoin approach, seeking to identify weaknesses, potential benefits offered versus the additional resource costs/latency involved, and considers whether such an approach might be used to secure cloud forensic trails.","[Zhao, Yuan; Duncan, Bob] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen, Scotland","University of Aberdeen","Zhao, Y (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen, Scotland.","y.zhao@abdn.ac.uk; robert.duncan@abdn.ac.uk","","Duncan, Bob/0000-0002-9692-4667; Zhao, Yuan/0000-0002-9362-129X","","","","","46","3","3","1","17","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-7879-4","","","","2018","","","","","","","677","684","","10.1109/HPCS.2018.00111","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HPCS.2018.00111","","","8","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BL4RT","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000450677700093","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Modern blockchains underpin a variety of applications: from designing a global identity to improving satellite connectivity. In our research we look at the ability of blockchains to store metadata in an increasing volume of transactions and with evolving focus of utilization. We further show that basic approaches to improving blockchain privacy also rely on embedding metadata. This paper identifies and classifies real-life blockchain transactions embedding metadata of a number of major protocols running essentially over the bitcoin blockchain. The empirical analysis here presents the evolution of metadata utilization in the recent years, and the discussion suggests steps towards preventing criminal use. Metadata are relevant to any blockchain, and our analysis considers primarily bitcoin as a case study. The paper concludes that simultaneously with both expanding legitimate utilization of embedded metadata and expanding blockchain functionality, the applied research on improving anonymity and security must also attempt to protect against blockchain abuse.","[Faisal, Tooba; Courtois, Nicolas] UCL, London, England; [Serguieva, Antoaneta] nChain & LSE Syst Risk, London, England","University of London; University College London","Faisal, T (corresponding author), UCL, London, England.","tooba.hashmi@gmail.com; n.courtois@ucl.ac.uk; antoaneta@ncrypt.com","","","","","","","46","6","6","1","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2161-4393","","978-1-5090-6014-6","IEEE IJCNN","","","2018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BQ3NO","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000585967404119","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Bitcoin first documented by allies Satoshi Nakamoto, the first decentralized currency payment system has gained a considerable attention in the financial system, economics, social media and computer science due to its combination of peer-to-peer nature, encryption technology, and monetary unit. Predicting the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a great challenge because it is immensely complex and dynamic in nature. In this paper, we have tried to predict the future price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and used Twitter data to predict public mood. By combining both market sentiment and social sentiment because bitcoin price shows mixed properties. We also have selected some other important features from the blockchain information which has a major impact on Bitcoin's supply and demand and using them to train model that improves the predictive power of the future Bitcoin price. We have performed a deep study of how data from social media affect the price of Bitcoin and so we have included the twitter data in model training. Our model shows that how well LSTM predict the price of Bitcoin considering the high volatility. The precision given by our model is 60% and accuracy is 50%.

The goal of the paper is to analyze double-spend attacks on the different blockchain-based systems and compare resulting probabilities of attacker's success. Method. We presented two models for two types of attacks on the Ouroboros protocol (for the general and covert adversaries). The models allow calculating the exact number of slots needed to achieve the required level of security. It was shown that the Ouroboros protocol allows achieving the required security level with significantly shorter confirmation period in comparison with Bitcoin. We estimated minimal number of confirmation blocks and compare estimation time for Bitcoin, GHOST and Ouroboros protocols. As a measure of comparison, we considered transaction confirmation time for which the probability of a double-spend attack is less than 0.1%. We use different standard probability distribution and different properties of Markov chains and Random Walks to get comparison of estimated security properties of Bitcoin blockchain against three different models of Bitcoin double spend attack. The splitting attack based on the model where resources of honest participants are divided to compete different chains is applied to Bitcoin and GHOST consensus protocols. Properties of Markov chains and Random Walks are also applied to obtain security estimations for the Ouroboros protocol. Results. We developed methods to get specific numbers for average block confirmation time for Ouroboros protocol. We compared minimal number of confirmation blocks needed to ensure a high security for considered protocols: Bitcoin, GHOST and Ouroboros. Conclusions. The obtained results allow determination of security bounds for the Bitcoin, GHOST and Ouroboros consensus protocols. Users of the practically deployed blockchain systems may get specific parameters for a given assurance level.","[Kaidalov, D. S.; Kovalchuk, L. V.; Nastenko, A. O.; Rodinko, M. Yu.; Shevtsov, O.

Calling on both theoretical developments (such as Georg Simmel's) and social practice and even technical aspects, one of its central objectives is to pose a series of questions regarding digital currencies, particularly bitcoin, which, despite initially promising to be anti- capitalist, has, in fact, become its most sophisticated tool. Starting with two general views of money (functional and historical- political), the article then zooms in on a number of ideas that have come about since the end of the nineteenth century regarding the dematerialization of currency. Finally, it outlines questions on bitcoin and concludes with a reflection on the autonomization of money in light of the alienation of contemporary subjectivity.","[Gabriel Borisonik, Hernan] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)","Borisonik, HG (corresponding author), Godoy Cruz 2290,C1425FQB CABA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.","hborisonik@sociales.uba.ar","","Borisonik, Hernan/0000-0003-3247-043X","","","","","32","2","2","0","2","UNIV OBERTA CATALUNYA","BARCELONA","AV TIBIDABO 39-43, BARCELONA, 08035, SPAIN","1575-2275","","","DIGITHUM","Digithum","JAN","2018","","21","","","","","1","10","","10.7238/d.v0i21.3108","http://dx.doi.org/10.7238/d.v0i21.3108","","","10","Humanities, Multidisciplinary","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Arts & Humanities - Other Topics","GL8SS","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000437496300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, public blockchain systems like the Bitcoin system face a problem of scalability, primarily due to the significant and growing size of its blockchain. This paper introduces a method, termed block summarization, which reduces blockchain storage overhead for systems having transferable transactions. The proposed method allows resource-restricted light nodes to store a form of the blockchain such that it can validate the transactions independently which ultimately reduce dependency on full nodes. This way, we can achieve a middle ground between Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes which can only verify the membership of a transaction in the blockchain, and full nodes with pruning enabled which can only support pruning provided they have an infrastructure of full nodes. We implemented our algorithm for a custom blockchain using Bitcoin blocks and were able to achieve a compression ratio of 0.54.","[Palai, Asutosh; Vora, Meet; Shah, Aashaka] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India","Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Roorkee","Palai, A (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India.","asupl.ucs2014@iitr.ac.in; meetv.uee2014@iitr.ac.in; ash96.ucs2014@iitr.ac.in","","","","","","","8","23","24","1","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2157-4952","","978-1-5386-3662-6","INT CONF NEW TECHNOL","","","2018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BL2CQ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000448864200065","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Analyzing blockchain data is useful for tasks such as detecting fraudulent activities, studying the use and growth of the system, and understanding its levels of anonymity and traceability. Such analysis is challenging due to the high volume and rapidly changing characteristics of popular blockchains. In particular, online (soft real-time) analysis of blockchains requires methods that adapt organically to changes in the data.

Changes to blockchain data is achieved through consensus amongst blockchain network participants, rather than through a central node's authoritative decision. Similarly, governance, i.e., changes to features and underlying source code, is achieved through a decentralized mechanism. As adoption of blockchain has increased, the need to evolve and adopt new features has grown. These changes highlight the mechanism by which the network, rather than a central node, makes decisions. One change in particular, proposed increases to the block size to address scalability limitations, has been particularly demonstrative of the governance mechanisms employed by disparate blockchains. For example, two digital currency projects, Bitcoin and Dash, employ significantly different governance mechanisms: the Dash Decentralized Governance By Blockchain (DGBB) process, and the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process, to decide what changes to make to their blockchains. Dash governance was able to decide to alter the block size in a matter of hours, while Bitcoin governance took several years to make the same decision. This paper evaluates the governance mechanisms of blockchain projects using the change in block size as an exemplar. Two prominent governance mechanisms are described, compared, and assessed based upon how effective they came to consensus and made the decision to change to support the disparate needs of stakeholders.","[DiRose, Stephen; Mansouri, Mo] Stevens Inst Technol, Sch Syst & Enterprises, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA","Stevens Institute of Technology","DiRose, S (corresponding author), Stevens Inst Technol, Sch Syst & Enterprises, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA.","sdirose@me.com; mo.mansouri@stevens.edu","","","","","","","43","9","10","3","6","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-4876-6","","","","2018","","","","","","","195","202","","","","","","8","Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Operations Research & Management Science","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science","BO1SM","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000502320200030","View Full Record in Web of Science"

With more companies trying to adopt blockchain to modify their existing systems, blockchain working on old consensus methods and with scalability issues can't deliver the optimal solution. Specifically, with new trends like smart contracts and DAPPs, much better performance is needed to support any actual business applications. Such requirements are pushing the new platforms away from old methods of consensus and adoption of off-chain solutions. In this paper, we discuss various scalability issues with the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain and recent proposals like the lighting protocol, sharding, super quadratic sharding, DPoS to solve these issues. We also draw the comparison between these proposals on their ability to overcome scalability limits and highlighting major problems in these approaches.

Originality/value While the existing literature focuses simply on identifying areas that could play a role in financing terrorism, this paper describes concrete methods, taking both prevention and criminal perspectives into account.","[Teichmann, Fabian Maximilian Johannes] Teichmann Int AG, St Gallen, Switzerland","","Teichmann, FMJ (corresponding author), Teichmann Int AG, St Gallen, Switzerland.","teichmann@post.harvard.edu","","","","","","","36","6","6","3","19","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1758-7808","1368-5201","","J MONEY LAUND CONTRO","J.

Recently, cryptocurrencies with large market capitalization (mostly Bitcoin) have been studied theoretically, but a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms remains elusive. Here we explore the nonextensivity of price changes for 20 cryptocurrency exchanges from 2013 until 2017. We discover nonextensive triplets in the cryptocurrency market, where the three associated values for Bitcoin are remarkably close to those of the logistic map near the edge of chaos. The current findings strongly indicate that the cryptocurrency market represents a system whose physics is properly described by nonextensive statistical mechanics. Our results shed light on the complex and volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, and establish the first formal link with the nonextensive theory. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - The research took the form of a desk study, which analyzed various documents and reports such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) typologies reports in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2013 and 2014 on new payment methods (NPMs) which focused on the potential for NPM to be misused by criminals; the identification of risk factors which can significantly differ from one new payment product or service to another, depending on functionality; and risk mitigants which can be tailored to a particular new payment product or service to address its specific risk profile. Findings - This paper presents the following findings and recommendations: high-risk customers such as politically exposed persons (PEPs) could exploit the non-face-to-face feature of MMM by using the identity of low-risk customers (e.g. pensioners) to open MMM accounts. The Bitcoin funding option may present a higher money laundering risk than Bank wire, MasterCard, Visa Debit and Interac. The electronic nature of Bitcoins provides in principle a good foundation for effective record keeping and the monitoring of transactions. The money laundering risks associated with Goldmoney are very minimal when compared to Bitcoin. MMM Nigeria is therefore recommended to adopt Goldmoney as its preferred method of online payment for MMM transactions. Originality/value - While most publications on MMM are focused on fraud, this paper focuses on the money laundering risks and vulnerabilities associated with the MMM scheme.","[Esoimeme, Ehi Eric] Cardiff Univ, Dept Law, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Esoimeme, Ehi Eric] Deji Sasegbon & Co, Dept Publicat, Lagos, Nigeria","Cardiff University","Esoimeme, EE (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Dept Law, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.;Esoimeme, EE (corresponding author), Deji Sasegbon & Co, Dept Publicat, Lagos, Nigeria.","ehiesoimeme@yahoo.com","Esoimeme, Ehi Eric/L-7168-2018","Esoimeme, Ehi Eric/0000-0003-4054-3248","","","","","19","0","0","1","17","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1758-7808","1368-5201","","J MONEY LAUND CONTRO","J.

These distribute control among the players rather than requiring a centralized database, and so can reduce costs and speed-up transactions. However, when it is used for assets which exist outside the blockchain itself, an unmodified adoption of the technology would bypass legal and regulatory requirements which, for these kinds of assets, cannot be bypassed without fundamental change to the law. Building those requirements into any blockchain-based system introduces features which are not necessary for performing its core functions, and we call these 'legal impurities'. The most important legal impurities required are those relating to identification of the parties, and introducing the ability of a trusted third party to make modifications to the ledger. Not only does introducing these legal impurities make fundamental changes to the concept behind blockchain, but it is also essential that they are implemented in ways which do not threaten the integrity of the blockchain as evidence.

We propose this panel to engage the Information Systems Community about the current and future research trends in Blockchain based information systems.","[Salcedo, Eduardo; Pineda, Jose; Cousins, Karlene; Bouyad, Lina; Subramanian, Hemang] Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Conway, Daniel] Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Sheth, Alpen] MIT, Etherisc, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","State University System of Florida; Florida International University; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)","Salcedo, E (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA.","escalc007@fiu.edu; jpineda@fiu.edu; kcousins@fiu.edu; dconway@usf.edu; lbouyad@fiu.edu; alpen@etherisc.com; hsubrama@fiu.edu","","","","","","","8","0","0","0","2","ASSOC INFORMATION SYSTEMS","ATLANTA","P.O.

The use of blockchain, however, will be far beyond the financial sector; smart contracts, for example would allow business and legal agreements to be stored and executed online. It is anticipated that blockchain will do to middle-and back-office functions what the Internet and the Web have done to the front-office -automate functions. In this paper, we investigate what Chief Information Officers (CIOs) think of blockchain and how they plan to utilize it for their organizations. We conducted a survey that was completed by 25 CIOs in the United Arab Emirates and found mixed feelings about the technology and barriers for use. In this paper, we also discuss opportunities and challenges in adopting blockchain.","[AlTaei, May] Zayed Univ, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Al Barghuthi, Nedaa Baker] British Univ Dubai, Higher Coll Technol, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Mahmoud, Qusay H.] Univ Ontario Inst Technol, Oshawa, ON, Canada; [Al Barghuthi, Sonia] Minist Finance, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Said, Huwida] Zayed Univ, Dubai, U Arab Emirates","Zayed University; Higher Colleges of Technology - United Arab Emirates; Ontario Tech University; Zayed University","AlTaei, M (corresponding author), Zayed Univ, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.","may.altaei@zu.ac.ae; nedaa.albarghuthi@hct.ac.ae; qusay.mahmoud@uoit.ca; sbalbarghuthi@mof.gov.ae; huwida.said@zu.ac.ae","Sánchez-Gómez, Nicolás/K-3758-2014","","","","","","26","6","6","0","2","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1819-9127","","978-1-5386-6673-9","IEEE INT CONF INNOV","","","2018","","","","","","","157","162","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BM0FH","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000458718800028","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Following its development became a difficult task with the success of cryptocurrencies (CCs) other than Bitcoin. For fiat currency markets, the IMF offers the index SDR and, prior to the EUR, the ECU existed, which was an index representing the development of European currencies. Index providers decide on a fixed number of index constituents which will represent the market segment. It is a challenge to fix a number and develop rules for the constituents in view of the market changes. In the frequently changing CC market, this challenge is even more severe. A method relying on the AIC is proposed to quickly react to market changes and therefore enable us to create an index, referred to as CRIX, for the cryptocurrency market. CRIX is chosen by model selection such that it represents the market well to enable each interested party studying economic questions in this market and to invest into the market. The diversified nature of the CC market makes the inclusion of altcoins in the index product critical to improve tracking performance. We have shown that assigning optimal weights to altcoins helps to reduce the tracking errors of a CC portfolio, despite the fact that their market cap is much smaller relative to Bitcoin.

The blockchain serves as a decentralized, cryptographically signed ledger that enables payments in a trustless manner. While there are limitless applications of the blockchain, the problem that persists is the limited scaling of the blockchain. The bitcoin blockchain and the ethereum blockchain, are able to process only 7 transactions per second and 15 transactions per second respectively. All the participating mining nodes in the blockchain network perform heavy computation and compete to mine a block, but only one of them succeeds and others waste their computation. In this paper, we propose a new node count based transaction propagation protocol for less competitive mining called as NoCo. NoCo distributes a transaction from a node to the nearby miners based on the node count between them and thereby decreasing the competition, and hence this is beneficial for the miners as well as for the networks scalability. The protocol tries to parallelize the mining in the network. The protocol scales the transaction rates almost linearly.","[Sarda, Akash; Ghandare, Vijesh; Malu, Aditya; Abraham, Jibi] Coll Engn, Dept Comp & Informat Technol, Pune, Maharashtra, India","College of Engineering Pune","Sarda, A (corresponding author), Coll Engn, Dept Comp & Informat Technol, Pune, Maharashtra, India.","sardaa14.comp@coep.ac.in; ghandarevb14.comp@coep.ac.in; maluao14.comp@coep.ac.in; ja.comp@coep.ac.in","","","","","","","14","1","1","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-4146-0","","","","2018","","","","","","","41","47","","","","","","7","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BO5TP","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000518817300008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Nevertheless, users are selfish in nature and they may refuse to cooperate due to their concerns on energy and bandwidth consumption. Thus each user should receive a satisfying reward to compensate its resource consumption for cooperation. However, suitable incentive mechanisms that can meet the diverse requirements of users in dynamic and distributed P2P environments are still missing. On the other hand, we observe that Blockchain is a decentralized secure digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions and Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies get more and more market capitalization. Therefore in this paper, we propose a Blockchain based truthful incentive mechanism for distributed P2P applications that applies a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin to incentivize users for cooperation. In this mechanism, users who help with a successful delivery get rewarded. As users and miners in the Blockchain P2P system may exhibit selfish actions or collude with each other, we propose a secure validation method and a pricing strategy, and integrate them into our incentive mechanism. Through a game theoretical analysis and evaluation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness and security strength of our proposed incentive mechanism.","[He, Yunhua] North China Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Beijing 100144, Peoples R China; [Li, Hong; Sun, Limin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Xiuzhen] George Washington Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Liu, Yan] Peking Univ, Sch Software & Microelect, Beijing 102600, Peoples R China; [Yang, Chao] Xidian Univ, Sch Syber Engn, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","North China University of Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Engineering, CAS; George Washington University; Peking University; Xidian University","Li, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.","lihong@iie.ac.cn","",", Yunhua/0000-0001-8971-3936","Beijing Natural Science Foundation [4184085]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61702503, 61602053, 61672415]; Youth Science and Technology Innovation Foundation (North China University of Technology) [1473009]; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province [2017JM6054]","Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Science and Technology Innovation Foundation (North China University of Technology); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province)","This work was supported in part by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation under Grant 4184085, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61702503, Grant 61602053, and Grant 61672415, in part by the Youth Science and Technology Innovation Foundation (North China University of Technology) under Grant 1473009, and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province under Grant 2017JM6054.","","38","93","98","4","68","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2018","6","","","","","","27324","27335","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2821705","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2821705","","","12","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","GI6DQ","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000434460100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

For security reasons, the technical detail of digital coins (for example Bitcoin) are studied to stop security breaches. Bitcoin work dependently on a blockchain. Blockchain holds the record of all user's transactions. The user opens a wallet with public/private key pairs. The user then buy/sell his coin through the wallet. The security of the user's wallet depends on how secure the user's private key. Some people hide bitcoins (which in this case refers to the private key) in their house. Others hide the security key into a plain-text. In this paper we proposed a robust steganography technique to hide bitcoins into steganographic fractals. Steganographic fractal is our novel approach, it is not explored before. The fractal tree is selected for its simple recursive structure. The private-key bit stream is hidden by discretizing the angles and lengths of the tree branches. The tree can then be printed without the fear of being lost or stolen. The proposed approach showed high security and robustness to attacks.","[Hosam, Osama] Taibah Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Engn Yanbu, Yanbu, Saudi Arabia; [Hosam, Osama] SRTA City, Alexandira, Egypt","Taibah University","Hosam, O (corresponding author), Taibah Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Engn Yanbu, Yanbu, Saudi Arabia.;Hosam, O (corresponding author), SRTA City, Alexandira, Egypt.","mohandesosama@yahoo.com","Hosameldeen, Osama/ABG-1630-2022","","","","","","20","2","2","1","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2162-7843","","978-1-5386-7568-7","IEEE INT SYMP SIGNAL","","","2018","","","","","","","512","519","","","","","","8","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BM3PX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000462529100093","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It is important to know the key components, functional characteristics, and architecture of blockchain to understand its impact and applicability to various applications. The most well-known use case of blockchain is bitcoin: a cryptocurrency. Being a distributed ledger, consensus mechanism is needed among peer nodes of a blockchain network to ensure its proper working. Many consensus algorithms have been proposed in literature each having its own performance and security characteristics. One consensus algorithm cannot serve the requirements of every application. It is vital to technically compare the available consensus algorithms to highlight their strengths, weaknesses, and use cases. We have identified and discussed parameters related to performance and security of consensus in blockchain. The consensus algorithms are analyzed and compared with respect to these parameters. Research gap regarding designing an efficient consensus algorithm and evaluating existing algorithms is presented.

It does so by reviewing and synthesising recent cybercrime research from fields such as cybersecurity, law and criminology. The article also examines ways in which gaps between the aforementioned fields arise and how to lessen them to increase cybersecurity. This article is divided into four main parts. The first part offers background on cybercrime and some of its main elements. It defines terminology, sets out a legal taxonomy of cybercrime offences and presents the estimated costs, threat agents and characteristics of various illicit activities and technical aspects of cybercrime. Parts two, three and four build on this preceding analysis by (separately) examining three prominent threat vectors within the ecosystem - malware, the darknet and Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For each threat vector, the article identifies and investigates features, history, functions and current and expected states of development within the ecosystem. Through its attention to and synthesis of current research and results from different fields, this article offers a synoptic account of the cybercrime ecosystem, which can bridge potential knowledge gaps between fields.

While application-specific blockchains are powerful tools for fulfilling their niche use cases, there are blockchains like Ethereum that have a set of use cases comprising a superset of the use cases of many blockchains. These generalized blockchains are powerful tools for extending decentralization to new use cases without designing entirely new blockchains. This paper considers tradeoffs in the design and implementation of blockchain systems that intend to deliver general functionality and examines various current and Merged-mining, fragmentation, the network effect, scalability, and generalized blockchain approaches are all considered and put into context. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and Rootstock are considered in various aspects of the current limitations, and potential future solutions to problems noted. This paper weighs the chances of success of various generalized blockchain paradigms, including the network effect scalability and potential client-side use. We conclude that the network effect likely favors a Bitcoin/sidechain solution while scalability favors a direct Ethereum solution. The likelihood of success of mainstream adoption of any single decentralized application appears to favor an Ethereum solution.","[Worley, Carl] Auburn Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Skjellum, Anthony] Univ Tennessee, SimCtr, Chattanooga, TN USA; [Skjellum, Anthony] Univ Tennessee, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Chattanooga, TN USA","Auburn University System; Auburn University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee at Chattanooga; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee at Chattanooga","Worley, C (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.","crw0034@auburn.edu; tony-skjellum@utc.edu","","","National Science Foundation [1547164, 1547245, 1821926]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants Nos. 1547164, 1547245, and 1821926.

The following chapter identifies many questions which can guide lecturers through their own process of creating a blockchain syllabus. The list of topics and figures presented indicate how much time could be spent on these topics. This list does not present a definite syllabus, because the essence of blockchain is that it is a holistic approach which goes beyond naming topics. It raises certain questions and is intended to start a broader discussion which will eventually lead to a systematic approach to this multidimensional challenge. Structuring this journey leads to the following four main questions, which are considered relevant in this discussion: What are the key research topics in blockchain? What is the impact of blockchain and by what criteria do we define impact? Which building blocks of blockchain are relevant to understanding the blockchain mechanism? Which applications (beside Bitcoin) should be discussed and are expected to become important in the near and distant future? This journey closes with some methodological remarks based on my experience of teaching blockchain classes. Finally, it is obvious that any curriculum will be condemned to continuous adaption because blockchain technology is changing in an ongoing way.","[Dettling, Walter] Univ Appl Sci & Arts Northwestern Switzerland, Inst Informat Syst, Peter Merian Str 86, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland","FHNW University of Applied Sciences & Arts Northwestern Switzerland","Dettling, W (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci & Arts Northwestern Switzerland, Inst Informat Syst, Peter Merian Str 86, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.","walter.dettling@fhnw.ch","","","","","","","21","5","5","1","3","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","2198-4182","2198-4190","978-3-319-74322-6; 978-3-319-74321-9","STUD SYST DECIS CONT","","","2018","141","","","","","","213","225","","10.1007/978-3-319-74322-6_14","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-74322-6_14","10.1007/978-3-319-74322-6","","13","Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications","Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)","Business & Economics; Computer Science","BL0GH","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000445782200015","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The subject of the study is the specificities of using cryptocurrency in contracts of purchase and sale. Methodology. The research is based on an analysis of legal acts on the legal regulation of cryptocurrency in Ukraine. By means of the comparative legal method of investigation of certain provisions of Ukrainian legislation, the possibilities and limits of the use of cryptocurrency in contractual relations, in particular, contracts of purchase and sale are determined. The results of the study revealed that the cryptocurrency regime in Ukraine and in many countries is in a legal vacuum. Such a conclusion is based on the lack of clear legal clarification and consolidation of the concept and types of cryptocurrency in the relevant rules of the tax, banking, civil, and commercial law. In case of eliminating this gap, it is advisable to review the state policy on Bitcoin and its analogues. Practical implications. It is necessary and appropriate to introduce a corresponding license for cryptocurrency activities that can minimize the laundering of proceeds from crime or terrorism financing. It is suggested that eventually the relations concerning the digital currency will be regulated in Ukraine, but most likely, it will copy the experience of another state, which may have negative consequences. Relevance/originality. Analysis of a possible use of cryptocurrency in contracts of purchase and sale can become the basis for the development of the most promising directions of domestic civil law in contractual relations.","[Drozd, Oleksii] Natl Acad Internal Affairs, Dept Res Work Org, Kiev, Ukraine; [Basai, Oleg; Churpita, Hanna] Natl Acad Internal Affairs, Dept Civil Law & Procedure, Kiev, Ukraine","","Drozd, O (corresponding author), Natl Acad Internal Affairs, Dept Res Work Org, Kiev, Ukraine.","alex0674682444@gmail.com; basay_ov@gmail.com; alex0674682444@gmail.com","Churpita, Anna/T-2883-2019; Drozd, Oleksii/AAX-6521-2021","Churpita, Anna/0000-0003-3915-347X; ","","","","","5","1","1","1","10","BALTIC JOURNAL ECONOMIC STUDIES","RIGA","VALDEKU IELA 62-156, RIGA, LV-1058, LATVIA","2256-0742","2256-0963","","BALT J ECON STUD","Balt.

If the dust attacks occur in the blockchain, which sends large amounts of dust transactions to the blockchain, the time of transactions' confirmation will be more longer, which will lead to more security problems, such as double-spending or blockchain forks. In order to identify and prevent dust attacks, this paper proposes an innovative Anti-Dust security model, which analyzes the characteristics of dust attacks and learns from the historical transactions big data, uses the Gaussian distribution to construct a dust recognition algorithm. At the same time, a dust transaction pool will be added to improve the blockchain architecture. In the experiment, a large amount of dust transactions will be send to the blockchain. Taking 50000 dust attacks and 500 normal transactions as an example, the conformation time of blockchain without Anti-Dust is about 20000 seconds, and Anti-Dust is about 210 seconds. The results show that Anti-Dust is an effective defense method to identify and prevent the dust attacks.","[Wang, Yunpeng; Zhu, Fangdong] Sichuan Univ, Coll Comp, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jin; Li, Tao; Zhou, Xiaojun] Sichuan Univ, Coll Cybersecur, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yunpeng] Southwest China Inst Elect Technol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Sichuan University; Sichuan University","Yang, J (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Coll Cybersecur, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.","yunhuasheng@163.com; yangjin66@scu.edu.cn","王, 运鹏/U-9628-2019","","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFB0800600]; Natural Science Foundation of China [U1736212, 61572334]; Sichuan Province Key Research and Development Project of China [2018GZ0183]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [YJ201727]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Sichuan Province Key Research and Development Project of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This work is supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFB0800600) Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. U1736212 and No. 61572334) and Sichuan Province Key Research and Development Project of China (Grant No. 2018GZ0183) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. YJ201727).","","15","4","4","0","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-5738-6","","","","2018","","","","","","","274","280","","","","","","7","Computer Science, Information Systems","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BM7RS","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000468332100042","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The objective of the present paper is to identify similarities and differences between to two currency systems which represent a new generation of money that exists alongside the official and legal money system. The paper includes an analysis of the major characteristics of both currencies, their operating mechanisms in global and local contexts, as well as their risks and challenges for the financial markets. The article uses a mainly documentary research method and presents selected contributions of experts on the topics of social currencies and cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, empirical evidence is presented to highlight some important characteristics of the Bitcoin currency. The principal result of the paper is that, indeed there exist similarities between social currencies and cryptocurrencies, as for example the absence of a central bank, a lack of regulation and a limited minting process. However, because of aspects like their different origins, their local vs. global character and their inherent financial risks, the two money systems need to be interpreted as fundamentally different. Especially with reference to globally operating cryptocurrencies, given that there does not exist any public cover of the currency nor sufficient regulation, risk management mechanisms need to be improved in order to diminish the speculative tendencies inherent to this currency.","[Lara Gomez, Graciela; Demmier, Michael] Autonomous Univ Queretaro, Cerro Campanas S-N Col Ctr Hist, Queretaro 76016, Mexico","Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro","Gomez, GL; Demmier, M (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Queretaro, Cerro Campanas S-N Col Ctr Hist, Queretaro 76016, Mexico.","michael.demmler@uaq.mx","","","","","","","57","8","8","4","14","CIRIEC-ESPANA","VALENCIA","AVE NARANJOS, S-N, EDIF DEP ORIENTAL 2P21, VALENCIA, 46022, SPAIN","0213-8093","1989-6816","","CIRIEC","CIRIEC","AUG","2018","93","","","","","","265","291","","10.7203/CIRIEC-E.93.10978","http://dx.doi.org/10.7203/CIRIEC-E.93.10978","","","27","Economics","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Business & Economics","GT4NS","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000444482100009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It is the technology behind all the crypto currencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Etherum and now finding its way to record everything possible.

While all cryptocurrencies can theoretically and practically serve as a medium of exchange, they are unlikely to become common and liquid media of exchange unless they can illustrate utility in one of the other functions of money. Digital currencies' rigidly inflexible supply and wildly fluctuating demand make them too unstable to be used as a unit of account for the foreseeable future. Of the five, only Bitcoin has the potential to serve as a store of value, due to its strict commitment to low supply growth, credibly backed by the network's distributed protocol and credible demonstration of the absence of any authority capable of altering the supply schedule. Other cryptocurrencies' centralized control, and use as tokens for specific applications make them unlikely to fulfil monetary functions. (C) 2018 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

We show that under a plausible hardness assumption, the most efficient SNARK schemes proposed in the literature, including the one underlying Zcash and contingent payments, satisfy subversion ZK or can be made to at very little cost. In particular, we prove subversion ZK of the original SNARKs by Gennaro et al. and the almost optimal construction by Groth; for the Pinocchio scheme implemented in libsnark we show that it suffices to add 4 group elements to the CRS.

Bitcoin, as the most common type of cryptocurrency, is a decentralized digital money system, developed by an open community that uses it. Bitcoins are part of financial activities directly connected to IT sector, but due to the challenges they have recently caused they became the subject of legislative interest. The greatest problem of cryptocurrencies is the lack of specific legal regulation. The national legislation of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina on prevention of money laundering did not include virtual money as a potential means of money laundering yet. When something is not regulated it is the opportunity for frauds and other malversations. The authors elaborate procedures of obtaining the evidences on money laundering and point out future challenges and difficulties of possible money laundering throughout the cryptocurrencies on national and international level. They emphasize the role of the insurance industry in recognition of cryptocurrencies as the new industry and part of financial market. Whether they will be part of future business or not the cryptocurrenncies have already attracted enough attention to require the necessity to become the part of specific legal regulation.","[Maleta, Nikolina; Stipanovic, Ivana] Univ Mostar, Fac Law, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg","University of Mostar","Maleta, N (corresponding author), Univ Mostar, Fac Law, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg.","nikolina.maleta@pf.sum.ba; ivana.stipanovic@pf.sum.ba","Maleta, Nikolina/ABF-5274-2020","","","","","","18","0","0","2","5","VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY","VARAZDIN","MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA","1849-6903","1849-7535","","EC SOC DEVELOP","","","2018","","","","","","","589","598","","","","","","10","Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law","BP1SI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000540727600067","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A Blockchain is known by a public ledger and public transactions stored in a chain. The properties of blockchain demonstrate in decentralization as distribution blocks, stability, anonymity, and auditing. Blockchain can enhance the results of network efficiency and improve the security of network. It also can be applied in several fields like financial and banking services, healthcare systems, and public services. However, the research is still opening at this point. It includes a big number of technical challenges which prevents the wide application of blockchain, for example, scalability problem, privacy leakage, etc. This paper shows a proposed comprehensive study of blockchain technology. It also examines the research efforts in blockchain. It presents a proposed blockchain lifecycle which refers to an evolution and a linked ring between business process management improvement and Internet-of-Things concepts. Then, this paper presents a practical proof of this relationship for smart city. It presents a new algorithm and a proposed blockchain framework for 38 blocks (which recognized as smart-houses). Finally, the future directions are well presented in blockchain field.","[Hussein, Doaa Mohey El-Din M.; Taha, Mohamed Hamed N.; Khalifa, Nour Eldeen M.] Cairo Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Cairo, Egypt","Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University","Hussein, DMEM (corresponding author), Cairo Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Cairo, Egypt.","","Khalifa, Nour Eldeen/J-6441-2015; Taha, Mohamed/H-9470-2015","Khalifa, Nour Eldeen/0000-0001-8614-9057; Taha, Mohamed/0000-0003-0200-2918","","","","","40","7","7","1","52","SCIENCE & INFORMATION SAI ORGANIZATION LTD","WEST YORKSHIRE","19 BOLLING RD, BRADFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE, 00000, ENGLAND","2158-107X","2156-5570","","INT J ADV COMPUT SC","Int.

This cryptocurrency is supported by an immutable database and is distributed throughout a network of thousands of nodes, known as Blockchain. One way to ensure that all the concepts behind the Blockchain technology and infrastructure are seized is to conduct the development of one of the most popular context applications for it: a wallet for well-known cryptocurrencies. Yet Another Bitcoin Wallet (YABW) is a hybrid application available for both Android and iOS, which was developed with the Ionic and Angular frameworks. This application communicates with Bitcoin Blockchain to send, receive and store bitcoins; provides a set of features focused on security and user experience, and is available on the Play Store and Apple Store. A rather relevant issue that is becoming a major subject of current research is the application of the Blockchain infrastructure to other contexts that are neither directly connected to cryptocurrencies, nor are finance related. The implementation of a proof-of-concept application proposes the use of a blockchain for a specific case study: the exchange of meal vouchers of an institution amongst students. This is achieved using the decentralized platform Ethereum, which allows us to create a Smart Contract using the Solidity programming language to create a token that follows the Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC), the ERC-20 standard and represents the meal vouchers. This second application uses the architecture defined for YABW, reusing major components and custom developing specific modules to enhance the required features. There is still a lot of research to be done on the non-financial applicability of the Blockchain infrastructure and technology, but for the moment, we have left further evidence that it is possible and is a relative straight-forward process to accomplish from the technological perspective.","[Ferreira, Micael; Rodrigues, Sven] Polytech Inst Leiria, Sch Technol & Management, P-2411901 Leiria, Portugal; [Reis, Catarina I.; Maximiano, Marisa] Polytech Inst Leiria, Sch Technol & Management, Comp Sci & Commun Res Ctr CIIC, P-2411901 Leiria, Portugal","","Reis, CI (corresponding author), Polytech Inst Leiria, Sch Technol & Management, Comp Sci & Commun Res Ctr CIIC, P-2411901 Leiria, Portugal.","micaelsfer@gmail.com; sven.nogueira@gmail.com; catarina.reis@ipleiria.pt; marisa.maximiano@ipleiria.pt","Reis, Catarina/X-9840-2018; da Silva Maximiano, Marisa/H-6712-2019; Sánchez-Gómez, Nicolás/K-3758-2014","Reis, Catarina/0000-0003-1529-629X; da Silva Maximiano, Marisa/0000-0002-1212-7864; ","FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology [UID/CEC/04524/2016]; FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology","FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology)","This research was funded by the FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology, I.P. grant number UID/CEC/04524/2016 And The APC was funded by the FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology, I.P.","","28","6","6","0","27","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2076-3417","","APPL SCI-BASEL","Appl.

In this work, we introduce CLoTH, a simulator for HTLC payment networks (of which LN is the best working example). It simulates input-defined payments on an input-defined HTLC network and produces performance measures in terms of payment-related statistics (such as time to complete payments and probability of payment failure). CLoTH helps to predict issues and obstacles that might emerge in the development stages of an HTLC payment network and to estimate the effects of an optimisation action before deploying it. We conducted simulations on a recent snapshot of the HTLC payment network of LN. These simulations allowed us to identify network and payments configurations for which a payment is more likely to fail than to succeed. We proposed viable solutions to avoid such configurations.","[Conoscenti, Marco; Vetro, Antonio; De Martin, Juan Carlos] Politecn Torino, Nexa Ctr Internet & Soc, Dept Control & Comp Engn DAUIN, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Spini, Federico] Roma Tre Univ, Dept Engn, I-00154 Rome, Italy","Polytechnic University of Turin; Roma Tre University","Conoscenti, M (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Nexa Ctr Internet & Soc, Dept Control & Comp Engn DAUIN, I-10129 Turin, Italy.","marco.conoscenti@polito.it; antonio.vetro@polito.it; demartin@polito.it; federico.spini@uniroma3.it","Vetro', Antonio/P-7939-2018; Vetrò, Antonio/M-9042-2019","Vetro', Antonio/0000-0003-2027-3308; Vetrò, Antonio/0000-0003-2027-3308; De Martin, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-7867-1926; Conoscenti, Marco/0000-0003-2483-7692","TIM S.p.A. - M.C.'s Ph.D. Scholarship","TIM S.p.A. - M.C.'s Ph.D. Scholarship","This research was supported in part by TIM S.p.A., which sponsored M.C.'s Ph.D. Scholarship.","","15","11","11","2","8","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2078-2489","","INFORMATION","Information","SEP","2018","9","9","","","","","","","223","10.3390/info9090223","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info9090223","","","26","Computer Science, Information Systems","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Computer Science","GU3QM","","Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000445194300018","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Design/methodology/approach: The article describes the capabilities and tools for using cryptocurrency for entrepreners. Selected cryptocurrencies are subjected to statistical analyzes, and so analyze the daily values of the exchange rates from the time of the occurrence of the given cryptochange. Based on the data of selected cryptocurrencies, the possibilities of speculation with cryptocurrency for entrepreneurs are subsequently proposed in the article. Findings: Entrepreneurs can also use cryptocurrencies to pay for ordinary businesses in a number of ways without the use of above-standard computing. At the present time, the greater spread of cryptocurrencies payments defends them high volatile and relatively large charges. The cryptocurrencies can be use entrepreneurs for trading. Research/practical implications: In the Czech Republic there is a relevant legal regulation that allows transactions to be carried out in cryptocurrencies in accordance with Czech law, using appropriate electronic sales records. The issue contains many other topics for research. Originality/value: Cryptocurrencies are considered the biggest innovation in the financial markets over the last 20 years. The use of these entrepreneur's tools has been small for now; however, they may still be a tool to develop enreprenur in the financial markets.","[Kolkova, Andrea] VSB TU Ostrava, Ekon Fak, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic","Technical University of Ostrava","Kolkova, A (corresponding author), VSB TU Ostrava, Ekon Fak, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic.","andrea.kolkova@vsb.cz","Kolkova, Andrea/G-9036-2018","Kolkova, Andrea/0000-0002-4764-3164","","","","","11","0","0","1","11","OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE","PRAGUE 3","UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC","","","978-80-245-2274-6","","","","2018","","","","","","","541","552","","","","","","12","Business; Management","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics","BM2RL","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000461375200045","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The subject of research is not only this technology but also its commercial exploitation. In order to understand the platform, the starting point of this research is an analysis of how the technology functions, after that the advantages for business and economic transaction are identified, and finally the paper deals with an impact of new technology on business, above all on financial operations. The basic hypothesis is that blockchain has achieved a great impact on financial sector, also it has the potential to radically change only the financial sector but also the way we buy and sell, our interaction with the authorities as a way of verifying the ownership from the authorship and the organic food production. Using the available data and synthesis of knowledge from the fields of technology, economics, finance, and politics, 4 scenarios were set up for the future of underlying technology. The scenario approach combined with trend analysis in order to prove the starting hypothesis with high reliability. The research results show that the technology being investigated already has a profound impact on the financial sector, that it is in the initial phase of changing many industries, with the likelihood that they will change them significantly in the next five to ten years.

The new currency instrument is abstract currencies. They are currencies in the sense that they can be exchanged peer-to-peer. They are representations of numbers, i.e. abstract objects. An abstract currency system is a self-enforcing system of property rights over an abstract instrument which gives its owners the freedom to use and the right to exclude others from using the instrument. Cryptocurrency or virtual currency is a cryptographically protected, decentralized digital currency used as a means of exchange. Due to the development of new technologies and innovations, the rate of use of virtual currency is rapidly increasing throughout the globe, replacing not only cash payments and payments by bank transfer, but also electronic cash payments. Among the best-known representatives of cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum. Legal scholars have not yet reached a consensus regarding the nature and legal status of virtual currency. Virtual currency possesses the nature of obligations rights as well as property rights, since it may be both a means of payment and a commodity. Depending on the country, the approach to cryptocurrencies may be different. Today there is already an international cryptocurrency community that does not have a single coordinating center. Only progressive jurisdiction and state regulation of cryptocurrency activity will allow the creation of the conditions that will ensure the implementation of legitimate and safe cryptocurrency relations.","[Cvetkova, Irina] Balt Int Acad, 4 Lomonosova St, LV-1003 Riga, Latvia","","Cvetkova, I (corresponding author), Balt Int Acad, 4 Lomonosova St, LV-1003 Riga, Latvia.","cvetkova@inbox.lv","Cvetkova, Irina/ABF-3844-2020","Cvetkova, Irina/0000-0003-3841-8763","","","","","6","14","15","3","41","LLC V EM PUBLISHING HOUSE","MOSCOW","UL LOBACHEVSKOGO, 92, KORPUS 2, MOSCOW, 119454, RUSSIA","2409-9058","2412-2343","","BRICS LAW J","BRICS Law J.","","2018","5","2","","","","","128","153","","10.21684/2412-2343-2018-5-2-128-153","http://dx.doi.org/10.21684/2412-2343-2018-5-2-128-153","","","26","Law","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Government & Law","GM3AK","","gold, Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000437968000007","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In 2017, Gartner positioned blockchain close to the peak of inflated expectations, acknowledging the enthusiasm for this technology that is now largely discussed by media. In this scenario, the risk to adopt it in the wake of enthusiasm, without objectively judging its actual added value is rather high. Insurance is one the sectors that, among others, started to carefully investigate the possibilities of blockchain. For this specific sector, however, the hype cycle shows that the technology is still in the innovation trigger phase, meaning that the spectrum of possible applications has not been fully explored yet. Insurers, as with many other companies not necessarily active only in the financial sector, are currently requested to make a hard decision, that is, whether to adopt blockchain or not, and they will only know if they were right in 3-5 years. The objective of this paper is to support actors involved in this decision process by illustrating what a blockchain is, analyzing its advantages and disadvantages, as well as discussing several use cases taken from the insurance sector, which could easily be extended to other domains.","[Gatteschi, Valentina; Lamberti, Fabrizio; Demartini, Claudio] Politecn Torino, Dipartimento Automat & Informat, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Pranteda, Chiara] Reale Grp Innovat Team, Via Corte Appello 11, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Santamaria, Victor] Reale Grp Innovat Team, Principe Vergara 125, Madrid 28002, Spain","Polytechnic University of Turin","Gatteschi, V (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Dipartimento Automat & Informat, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.","valentina.gatteschi@polito.it; fabrizio.lamberti@polito.it; claudio.demartini@polito.it; chiara.pranteda@realemutua.it; victor.santamaria@realeites.com","Sánchez-Gómez, Nicolás/K-3758-2014; Gatteschi, Valentina/C-5375-2014; Lamberti, Fabrizio/I-9153-2012","Gatteschi, Valentina/0000-0001-6075-6430; Lamberti, Fabrizio/0000-0001-7703-1372","","","","","57","142","151","11","80","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1999-5903","","","FUTURE INTERNET","Future Internet","FEB","2018","10","2","","","","","","","20","10.3390/fi10020020","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi10020020","","","16","Computer Science, Information Systems","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Computer Science","GG5SZ","","Green Submitted, gold, Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000432757300009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We propose a novel time-lock encryption scheme, whose main advantage over prior constructions is that even receivers with relatively weak computational resources should immediately be able to decrypt after the deadline, without any interaction with the sender, other receivers, or a trusted third party. We build our time-lock encryption on top of the new concept of computational reference clocks and an extractable witness encryption scheme. We explain how to construct a computational reference clock based on Bitcoin. We show how to achieve constant level of multilinearity for witness encryption by using SNARKs. We propose a new construction of a witness encryption scheme which is of independent interest: our scheme, based on SUBSET-SUM, achieves extractable security without relying on obfuscation. The scheme employs multilinear maps of arbitrary order and is independent of the implementations of multilinear maps.","[Liu, Jia] Univ Surrey, ICS, 5GIC, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Jager, Tibor; Kakvi, Saqib A.] Paderborn Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Paderborn, Germany; [Warinschi, Bogdan] Univ Bristol, Dept Comp Sci, Bristol, Avon, England","University of Surrey; University of Paderborn; University of Bristol","Liu, J (corresponding author), Univ Surrey, ICS, 5GIC, Guildford, Surrey, England.","j.liu@surrey.ac.uk; tibor.jager@upb.de; saqib.kakvi@upb.de; csxbw@bristol.ac.uk","Jager, Tibor/AAJ-3288-2020; Kakvi, Saqib A./AAU-6712-2020","Kakvi, Saqib A./0000-0003-4425-4240","UK EPSRC as part of the PETRAS IoT Research Hub Cybersecurity of the Internet of Things grant [EP/N02334X/1]; Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany, project REZEIVER [16K1S0711]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/N02334X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; PETRAS [P-CARS] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/N02334X/1] Funding Source: UKRI","UK EPSRC as part of the PETRAS IoT Research Hub Cybersecurity of the Internet of Things grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany, project REZEIVER; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); PETRAS; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","Jia Liu's work has been funded by the UK EPSRC as part of the PETRAS IoT Research Hub Cybersecurity of the Internet of Things grant no: EP/N02334X/1.

The barriers to the adoption of a technology are not simply the opposites of the enablers. Thus, we advocate that an understanding of the barriers will aid in the recognition of the limitations of the current state of blockchain technology.

With blockchain, individual cryptographic identity becomes the basis for new forms of money and for a whole suite of restructured social, political and financial transactions. But what do these developments signal for feminist engagements with the money economy? The transparency and pseudonymity that the blockchain provides has been welcomed as a feminist weapon'. But the decentralised technology also legitimises many longstanding assumptions of libertarianism, especially competitive individualism, naturalised social inequality and the stability of value associated with the gold standard. Drawing on popular culture texts, Goldfinger and The Mandibles, this article considers this history, examining the gendered, racialised and sexualised discursive practices that attend representations of gold along with the metallism' surrounding blockchain-based cryptocurrencies in the contemporary conjuncture. By claiming to represent non-negotiable certainty derived from technology/nature rather than social convention, the fantasy of fundamental value returns, together with related associations of essentialism and authenticity, but anchored in this new context in the technocratic authoritarianism of FinTech. This is part of the background for the new libertarianism' whose ascendency now overshadows the neoliberalism that has been the focus of critical attention for some decades.","[Allon, Fiona] Univ Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Gender & Cultural Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia","University of Sydney","Allon, F (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Gender & Cultural Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia.","fiona.allon@sydney.edu.au","Sánchez-Gómez, Nicolás/K-3758-2014","","","","","","69","7","7","2","35","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0816-4649","1465-3303","","AUST FEMINIST STUD","Aust.

In the early years of the Internet, inspired entrepreneurs such as Jeffrey Bezos realized that, when something grows exponentially, it becomes ubiquitous within a short time span. Similarly to the Internet in 1994, cryptocurrencies have recently been growing at a dazzling rate, thus one can expect them to be used on a global scale very soon, in spite of the last bubble which has already burst. Alternative currencies are greeted with great enthusiasm, due to their potential to return financial power back to the people, especially in the context of general dissatisfaction and disappointment with the banking sector. They bring about several advantages, such as financial innovations, lower fees as well as increased availability to developing populations. At the same time, their high volatility and lack of supervision might imply that they only serve as complementary financing and not as a substitute of traditional banking. This article discusses the development of cryptocurrencies, including aspects related to Bitcoin, financial technology and the blockchain. Using historical data from Coinmarketcap. com between April 2013 and February 2018, I run a quantitative analysis of the distributions and evolution over time for all listed cryptocurrencies with known market capitalization. I look at the interplay between number of cryptocurrencies and market value, at growth rates, cumulative shares and volatility. I find a phenomenon of exponential growth and violent volatility, which I explain in light of cryptocurrencies' strengths and weaknesses, as identified in the literature. I emphasize the importance of cryptocurrencies in the context of the global digital economy and I discuss future implications.","","","","cristianstefan1984@yahoo.com","","","","","","","11","2","2","3","25","SCIENDO","WARSAW","BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND","2502-0226","2558-9652","","P INT CONF BUS EXCEL","Proc.

The globalization of technology and rise of popularity in cryptocurrencies has changed the face of black-market trade and the actors that carry out these crimes. While art and antiquities have long served as a market with susceptibilities to laundering, the emergence of Dark Web markets, identification-masking software, and untraceable cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have opened new doors to potential vulnerabilities. The anonymity that is offered by these technologies acts as a roadblock for authorities, while attracting the likes of terrorists and transnational criminals. Investigative research using cyber security platforms to identify digital artifacts connected to potential traffickers provides the opportunity to unmask the seemingly untraceable actors behind these activities. The evidence of illicit antiquities trafficking on the Dark Web displayed in this article can generate a new discussion on how and where to study black-market antiquities to gain needed insight into combating the illicit trade online and the transnational criminal groups it may finance.","[Paul, Katie A.] Antiqu Coalit, 1875 Connecticut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20008 USA","","Paul, KA (corresponding author), Antiqu Coalit, 1875 Connecticut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20008 USA.","KPaul@theantiquitiescoalition.org","","","","","","","78","5","5","2","27","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","2076-0752","","","ARTS","Arts","JUN","2018","7","2","","","","","","","12","10.3390/arts7020012","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/arts7020012","","","19","Humanities, Multidisciplinary","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Arts & Humanities - Other Topics","GK8OI","","Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000436485600002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this article, George first traces for us the origins of his theory that has endured for four decades. A key dimension of McDonaldization is the 'iron cage' of control, via rationalization. Once contained within physical sites of bricks and mortar, now, we encounter a 'velvet cage' in sites of digital consumption, at the hands of non-human technologies, that threaten human labor and autonomy. Whilst the concept of the McUniversity is not without some critique, this interview provides compelling reasons to open new dialogue about McDonaldization in augmented settings such as Higher Education. With the rise of prosuming machines such as blockchain and bitcoin, that can both produce and consume without intervention from human 'prosumers', universities cannot afford to ignore the challenges of prosumer capitalism, which George concludes, will explode into unprecedented and unpredictable directions in the years to come.","[Ritzer, George] Univ Maryland, Dept Sociol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Jandric, Petar] Zagreb Univ Appl Sci, Dept Informat & Comp, Zagreb, Croatia; [Hayes, Sarah] Aston Univ, Ctr Learning Innovat & Profess Practice, Birmingham, W Midlands, England","University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Aston University","Jandric, P (corresponding author), Zagreb Univ Appl Sci, Dept Informat & Comp, Zagreb, Croatia.","pjandric@tvz.hr","Hayes, Sarah/AAC-8701-2019","Hayes, Sarah/0000-0001-8633-0155; Jandric, Petar/0000-0002-6464-4142","","","","","34","10","10","3","7","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","2326-5507","","","OPEN REV EDUC RES","Open Rev.

Previous work shows factors which determinate the exchange rate. However, the technological determinants show decreasing significance. Objective: This paper explores whether the Open-source Software Ecosystem Health Operationalization (OSEHO) framework can be used to extend the given technology factors. Method: By conducting the OSEHO in a case-study on three distinct cryptocurrency ecosystems, this paper gives a better insight in the ecosystem's value, longevity and propensity for growth and the relation of these factors to the cryptocurrency value. Results: The 'healthiest' cryptocurrency ecosystem also shows the highest economic health. Two metrics from the OSEHO show strong positive significant correlation with the exchange rate. Conclusion: Metrics from the OSEHO show promising indications to be technological determinants for the exchange rate.

Virtual currency transactions are one of these examples. In this paper we scrutinize the accounting treatments used by different reporting entities for their virtual currencies transactions, we critically argue about cons and pros for such policies and support the views of other researchers and practitioners that a new accounting standard should be issued to clarify the recognition and measurement of virtual currencies.

In this work, we present DANDELION++, a first-principles defense against large-scale deanonymization attacks with near-optimal information-theoretic guarantees. DANDELION++ builds upon a recent proposal called Dandelion that exhibited similar goals. However, in this paper, we highlight some simplifying assumptions made in Dandelion, and show how they can lead to serious deanonymization attacks when violated. In contrast, DANDELION++ defends against stronger adversaries that are allowed to disobey protocol. DANDELION++ is lightweight, scalable, and completely interoperable with the existing Bitcoin network.

Bit-coin and a good number of other crypto currencies formed the long sought economic alternative to such extent that it is gradually getting public acceptance as a means of transaction. Subsequent upon the collapse of MMM, the Nigerian government dismissed the use of crypto as legal means of exchange in Nigeria. This brought about reaction from bit-coin participants, experts and government officials. This study therefore is an examination of online media coverage aimed at ascertaining the slant of coverage, the dominant media source and type and how detailed the reports issued in the media concerning Bit-coin are. The researcher used the qualitative and quantitative content analysis research method to examine the manifest contents of the selected online media while framing and social responsibility theory formed the benchmark for the study. The study spanned for three months covering December 2017 through February 2018. Findings revealed that Nigerian online media gave negative slant to their coverage of Bit-coin crypto currency. It was also found that while government source dominates news source, straight news reports dominated the types of media used in the coverage of Bit-coin crypto-currency. The researcher concluded that the media had played their social responsibility role to the public by providing detailed reports on bit-coin and recommended that the mainstream media should also join hands in delivering detailed messages on salient issues.","","","","","","","","","","","57","0","0","1","6","UNIV STUDI SALENTO","LECCE","EDIFICIO STUDIUM 2000, VIA DI VALESIO, LECCE, 73100, ITALY","2284-0753","","","H-ERMES","H-ermes","","2018","12","","","","","","141","171","","10.1285/i22840753n12p141","http://dx.doi.org/10.1285/i22840753n12p141","","","31","Communication","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Communication","GL8MK","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000437475200009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This paper imagines what would happen if artists were to retain 10% equity in their work in the primary market, rather than receive resale royalties in the secondary market. This idea applies the Coase Theorem in economics, concerning the relationship of property rights, pricing, and trade. Accordingly, those equity shares could trade in a standalone marketplace well before an artwork was sold, providing patronage for artists and more diversifiable art fund structures for investors. Technological systems such as the blockchain (e.g. bitcoin) make such a system timely, by providing cheap accounting and automatic provenance. This proposal stands in stark contrast to much of the writing on resale royalties, which treats payments to artists as welfare or subsidy, or emphasizes a lack of enforceability. In fact, assigning equity shares to artists allows them to participate more accurately, from a free-market-economics standpoint, in the value that their work creates. This realignment of price and value could radically alter and also stabilize the art market in relation to both recent financial crises and the increasing financialization of art objects. Such a system has broad applications to the alignment of price and value in many other sectors of creative work, and beyond.","[Whitaker, Amy] NYU, Visual Arts Adm, Steinhardt Sch, Dept Art & Art Profess, New York, NY 10003 USA","New York University","Whitaker, A (corresponding author), NYU, Visual Arts Adm, Steinhardt Sch, Dept Art & Art Profess, New York, NY 10003 USA.","","","Whitaker, Amy/0000-0002-5089-5370","","","","","54","6","6","4","19","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0197-3762","1477-2809","","VIS RESOUR","Vis.

In this paper, we create a measurement framework that we use to perform a large-scale, two-year, end-to-end measurement of ransomware payments, victims, and operators. By combining an array of data sources, including ransomware binaries, seed ransom payments, victim telemetry from infections, and a large database of Bitcoin addresses annotated with their owners, we sketch the outlines of this burgeoning ecosystem and associated third-party infrastructure. In particular, we trace the financial transactions, from the moment victims acquire bitcoins, to when ransomware operators cash them out. We find that many ransomware operators cashed out using BTC-e, a now-defunct Bitcoin exchange. In total we are able to track over $16 million in likely ransom payments made by 19,750 potential victims during a two-year period. While our study focuses on ransomware, our methods are potentially applicable to other cybercriminal operations that have similarly adopted Bitcoin as their payment channel.","[Huang, Danny Yuxing] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Aliapoulios, Maxwell Matthaios; McCoy, Damon] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Li, Vector Guo; Levchenko, Kirill; Snoeren, Alex C.] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Invernizzi, Luca; McRoberts, Kylie; Bursztein, Elie] Google Inc, Mountain View, CA USA; [Levin, Jonathan] Chainalysis, New York, DC USA","Princeton University; New York University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Google Incorporated","Huang, DY (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.","","Invernizzi, Luca/Y-3210-2019","Huang, Danny Yuxing/0000-0002-1794-6105","National Science Foundation [CNS-1619620, CNS-1717062, CNS-1629973]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work was funded in part by the National Science Foundation through CNS-1619620, CNS-1717062, and CNS-1629973, and by gifts from Comcast and Google.

To control for overparametrization, we rely on the Bayesian literature on shrinkage priors, which enables us to shrink coefficients associated with irrelevant predictors and/or perform model specification in a flexible manner. Using around one year of daily data, we perform a real-time forecasting exercise and investigate whether any of the proposed models is able to outperform the naive random walk benchmark.

Many altcoins and protocols are designed to improve Bitcoin on this issue, among which Zerocash is the first full-fledged anonymous ledger-based currency, using zero-knowledge proof, specifically zk-SNARK, to protect privacy. However, Zerocash suffers two problems: poor scalability and low efficiency. In this paper, we address the above issues by constructing a micropayment system in Zerocash called Z-Channel. First, we improve Zerocash to support multisignature and time lock functionalities, and prove that the reconstructed scheme is secure. Then we construct Z-Channel based on the improved Zerocash scheme. Our experiments demonstrate that Z-Channel significantly improves the scalability and reduces the confirmation time for Zerocash payments.","[Zhang, Yuncong; Long, Yu; Liu, Zhen; Liu, Zhiqiang; Gu, Dawu] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Dongchuan Rd 800, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China","Shanghai Jiao Tong University","Long, Y; Liu, Z; Liu, ZQ; Gu, DW (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Dongchuan Rd 800, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.","shjdzhangyuncong@sjtu.edu.cn; longyu@sjtu.edu.cn; liuzhen@sjtu.edu.cn; ilu_zq@sjtu.edu.cn; dwgu@sjtu.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61572318, 61672339, 61672347]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The authors are supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61572318, 61672339, 61672347).","","31","2","2","0","2","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-319-93638-3; 978-3-319-93637-6","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","10946","","","","","","687","705","","10.1007/978-3-319-93638-3_39","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-93638-3_39","","","19","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP3DO","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000546267700039","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This article examines the stability of the two time series of bitcoin's price and miner's hashrate from 2016 to the present. Research shows that price changes are the Granger cause of changes in hashrate. By establishing a distributed lag model, the quantitative relationship between hashrate and price is analyzed. Combined with the follow-up investigation of the miner's market, it discovered the pricing strategy of the miner's market, that is, the current miner's price is determined by the price of the previous cryptocurrency, and the lag period is calculated.","[Deng, Liping; Che, Jin; Chen, Huan; Zhang, Liang-Jie] Natl Engn Res Ctr Supporting Software Enterprise, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Deng, Liping; Che, Jin; Chen, Huan; Zhang, Liang-Jie] Kingdee Int Software Grp Co Ltd, Kingdee Res, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","","Deng, LP (corresponding author), Natl Engn Res Ctr Supporting Software Enterprise, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.;Deng, LP (corresponding author), Kingdee Int Software Grp Co Ltd, Kingdee Res, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.","liping_deng@kingdee.com","jin, che/AAZ-2877-2021",""," [2017YFB08 02703];  [2016YFB1000803];  [2017YFB1400604];  [2012FU125Q09];  [2015B0101 31008];  [JSGG20160331101809920]","; ; ; ; ; ","This work is partially supported by the technical projects No. 2017YFB08 02703, No. 2016YFB1000803, No. 2017YFB1400604, No. 2012FU125Q09, No. 2015B0101 31008 and No. JSGG20160331101809920.","","12","1","1","0","1","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-319-94478-4; 978-3-319-94477-7","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","10974","","","","","","228","240","","10.1007/978-3-319-94478-4_16","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-94478-4_16","","","13","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BQ7CF","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000614362600016","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Additionally, as everyone knows all the transactions in Bitcoin system will be baled by only one miner that will result in a lot of wasted effort, so another way to improve resource utilization is to change the original way to compete for miller to election and parallel milting.

However, the Proof-of-Work(PoW) mechanism used by Bitcoin requires long confirmation time and wastes more computing resource. Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), as another important protocol that has been widely used, which can tolerate at most 1/3 corruptions, meanwhile confirm transactions with quick speed In fact, it is difficult to Implement and maintain it with a large-scale setting. In this paper, considering a permissioned setting, we propose a Byzantine protocol based on the conunittee, and elect a committee to reach the consensus on behalf of all participants.

However, we cannot be sure that all vehicles willingly contribute their computing resources to the networks for message forwarding with no rewards for their efforts in real-world scenarios. In addition, unfortunately, there may exist some selfish and greedy node which may not help others but tend to take their own gain. To cope with this challenge, incentive mechanisms are generally considered as the promising solution. In this paper, we design a Bitcoin-based secure and reliable incentive scheme for cooperative vehicular delay tolerant networking services. Bitcoin is the well-known worldwide cryptocurrency and digital payment system whose implementation relies on cryptographic techniques, which makes it possible to develop a practical credit-based incentive scheme on the vehicular networks at a low cost. We also implement Bitcoin transaction scripts to handle our proposed incentive scheme.","[Park, Youngho; Rhee, Kyung-Hyune] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept IT Convergence & Applicat Engn, Busan, South Korea; [Sur, Chul] Busan Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Informat Secur, Busan, South Korea","Pukyong National University; Pusan University Foreign Studies","Rhee, KH (corresponding author), Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept IT Convergence & Applicat Engn, Busan, South Korea.","khrhee@pknu.ac.kr","","","Institute for Information&Communications Technology Promotion (IITP) grant - Korea Government (MSIT) [2017-0-00156]","Institute for Information&Communications Technology Promotion (IITP) grant - Korea Government (MSIT)","This work was supported by Institute for Information&Communications Technology Promotion (IITP) grant funded by the Korea Government (MSIT) (2017-0-00156, The Development of a Secure Framework and Evaluation Method for Blockchain).","","23","5","5","1","5","WILEY-HINDAWI","LONDON","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND","1939-0114","1939-0122","","SECUR COMMUN NETW","Secur.

Its underlying protocol (Nakamoto consensus) achieves this by using proof of work, which has the drawback that it causes the consumption of vast amounts of energy to maintain the ledger. Moreover, Bitcoin mining dynamics have become less distributed over time. Towards addressing these issues, we propose SpaceMint, a cryptocurrency based on proofs of space instead of proofs of work. Miners in SpaceMint dedicate disk space rather than computation. We argue that SpaceMint's design solves or alleviates several of Bitcoin's issues: most notably, its large energy consumption. SpaceMint also rewards smaller miners fairly according to their contribution to the network, thus incentivizing more distributed participation. This paper adapts proof of space to enable its use in cryptocurrency, studies the attacks that can arise against a Bitcoin-like blockchain that uses proof of space, and proposes a new blockchain format and transaction types to address these attacks. Our prototype shows that initializing 1 TB for mining takes about a day (a one-off setup cost), and miners spend on average just a fraction of a second per block mined. Finally, we provide a game-theoretic analysis modeling SpaceMint as an extensive game (the canonical game-theoretic notion for games that take place over time) and show that this stylized game satisfies a strong equilibrium notion, thereby arguing for SpaceMint's stability and consensus.","[Park, Sunoo; Kwon, Albert] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Fuchsbauer, Georg] CNRS, ENS, INRIA, Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Fuchsbauer, Georg] PSL, Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Gazi, Peter] IOHK, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Alwen, Joel; Pietrzak, Krzysztof] IST Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria","Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Inria; Institute of Science & Technology - Austria","Pietrzak, K (corresponding author), IST Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria.","pietrzak@ist.ac.at","","","NSF MACS [CNS-1413920]; DARPA IBM [W911NF-15-C-0236]; SIMONS Investigator Award; French ANR EfTrEC project [ANR16-CE39-0002]; European Research Council (ERC) [682815 - TOCNeT]","NSF MACS; DARPA IBM(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)); SIMONS Investigator Award; French ANR EfTrEC project(French National Research Agency (ANR)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC))","Sunoo's research is supported by the following grants: NSF MACS (CNS-1413920), DARPA IBM (W911NF-15-C-0236), and SIMONS Investigator Award Agreement Dated June 5th, 2012.

In such networks, trust-enabling agents and activities, that were traditionally arranged in a centralized fashion, are replaced by a network of nodes which collectively yet independently witness and establish the non-repudiability of transactions. Most often, a proof-of-work (PoW) requirement ensures that participants invest resources for joining the network, incentivizing conformance to the network rules, while making it highly infeasible for malicious agents to construct an alternative version of the transaction history. While research on security and efficiency aspects of blockchain networks is already being conducted, there is still work to be done to understand how different external and internal conditions guarantee or threaten their sustainability, i.e., their continuous operation. Focusing on public PoW-based blockchain platforms, in this paper we sketch an abstract model that is aimed at supporting comprehension and qualitative reasoning about the factors that affect sustainability of a blockchain network.","[Liaskos, Sotirios] York Univ, Sch Informat Technol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wang, Bo] York Univ, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada","York University - Canada; York University - Canada","Liaskos, S (corresponding author), York Univ, Sch Informat Technol, Toronto, ON, Canada.","liaskos@yorku.ca; bowang@eecs.yorku.ca","","","","","","","10","4","4","0","6","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","","978-1-4503-5191-1","","","","2018","","","","","","","383","387","","10.1145/3167132.3167175","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3167132.3167175","","","5","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BL7MA","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000455180700055","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this paper we first show how to remove the latter assumption, presenting a bootstrapped Bitcoin-like blockchain protocol relying on POWs that builds genesis blocks from scratch in the presence of adversarial pre-computation. Importantly, the round complexity of the genesis block generation process is independent of the number of participants. Next, we consider applications of our construction, including a PKI generation protocol and a consensus protocol without trusted setup assuming an honest majority (in terms of computational power).

It has gradually become a new generation of distributed, non-centralized and trust-based technology solution. However, the blockchain operation is expensive and transaction is delayed. Take BitCoin as an example. On the one hand, a block is produced every ten minute. On the other hand, once the new block is generated, it takes a certain time to propagate world wide. The slow speed of propagation determines that BitCoin can not use too small block interval time. Ethereum also faces similar problems, so the concept of uncle block was introduced to reduce blockchain forks. This paper introduces a new tree structure based broadcast propagation routing model, providing a novel method to organize network nodes and message propagation mechanism. In oder to avoid the single node failure problem, the tree cluster routing is proposed. The research shows that the tree based routing can accelerate broadcast convergence time and reduce redundant traffic.","[Kan, Jia; Zou, Lingyi; Liu, Bella; Huang, Xin] XJTLU, Suzhou, Peoples R China","Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University","Kan, J (corresponding author), XJTLU, Suzhou, Peoples R China.","Jia.Kan17@student.xjtlu.edu.cn","","Kan, Jia/0000-0001-5922-9502","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61701418]; Innovation Projects of The NextGeneration Internet Technology [NGII20170301]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Innovation Projects of The NextGeneration Internet Technology","The authors thank Brahma OS and the team advisors' help on information collection and idea pitching.

Second, the overall electric energy consumption of cryptocurrencies to estimate the environmental effects of Proof-of-Work. In this paper, we consider a complementary aspect: The stability of the power grids themselves. Power grids have to continuously maintain an equilibrium between power supply and consumption; extended periods of imbalance cause significant deviation of the utility frequency from its nominal value and destabilize the power grid, eventually leading to large-scale blackouts. Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies are potential candidates for creating such imbalances as disturbances in mining can cause abrupt changes in power demand. The problem is amplified by the ongoing centralization of mining hardware in large mining pools. Therefore, we investigate power consumption characteristics of miners, consult mining pool data, and analyze the amount of total power consumption as well as its worldwide distribution of two major cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Comparatively, conventional mining of aluminium, copper, gold, platinum and rare earth oxides consumed 122, 4, 5, 7 and 9 MJ to generate one US$, respectively, indicating that (with the exception of aluminium) cryptomining consumed more energy than mineral mining to produce an equivalent market value. While the market prices of the coins are quite volatile, the network hashrates for three of the four cryptocurrencies have trended consistently upward, suggesting that energy requirements will continue to increase. During this period, we estimate mining for all 4 cryptocurrencies was responsible for 3-15 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.","[Krause, Max J.] Oak Ridge Inst Sci & Educ, Cincinnati, OH 45212 USA","Oak Ridge Associated Universities; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge Institute for Science & Education","Krause, MJ (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Inst Sci & Educ, Cincinnati, OH 45212 USA.","maxjkrause@gmail.com","Krause, Max J./H-4351-2019","Krause, Max/0000-0001-8582-5826","","","","","31","88","89","16","80","NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","LONDON","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","2398-9629","","","NAT SUSTAIN","Nat.

Results show no significant spillover effects between the nascent market of cryptocurrencies and other financial markets. We suggest that cryptocurrencies are real independent financial instruments that pose no danger to financial system stability. Concerning the connectedness within the cryptocurrency markets, we report a time-frequency-dynamics connectedness nature. Moreover, the decomposition of the total spill over index is mostly dominated by a short frequency component (2-4 days) leading to the conclusion that this nascent market is highly speculative at present.

This paper proposes a decentralized coin mixing scheme CoinMingle, based on ring signature, one-time output address, CoinJoin and our mutual recognition delegation strategy. Our mutual recognition delegation strategy is simple but effective: when a user prepares to submit messages, he will delegate it to other users for anonymity. Users in CoinMingle don't need pre-compute. And CoinMingle can tolerate different input amounts and plug the leak of personal information in shuffling phase.

There are central banks which prohibit financial market participants to participate in activities associated with virtual currencies while others are considering their own virtual currency or thinking about virtual currencies in foreign reserves portfolio. The bank of Lithuania plans this year to issue a digital collector coin using blockchain or other equivalent technologies. So we can see very different central banks positions all over the world.

We examine the Clam airdrop of 2014, a forerunner to many of today's airdrops, that distributed a new cryptocurrency to every address with a non-dust balance on the Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin blockchains. Specifically, we use address clustering to try to construct the one-to-many mappings from entities to addresses on the blockchains, individually and in combination. We show that the sharing of addresses between the blockchains is a privacy risk.

Aims: To bridge this gap, we aim to carry out the first formal survey to explore the software engineering practices including requirement analysis, task assignment, testing, and verification of blockchain software projects. Method: We sent an online survey to 1,604 active BCS developers identified via mining the Github repositories of 145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses that met our criteria for analysis. Results: We found that code review and unit testing are the two most effective software development practices among BCS developers. The results suggest that the requirements of BCS projects are mostly identified and selected by community discussion and project owners which is different from requirement collection of general OSS projects. The results also reveal that the development tasks in BCS projects are primarily assigned on voluntary basis, which is the usual task assignment practice for OSS projects. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that standard software engineering methods including testing and security best practices need to be adapted with more seriousness to address unique characteristics of blockchain and mitigate potential threats.","[Chakraborty, Partha; Shahriyar, Rifat; Iqbal, Anindya] Bangladesh Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Bosu, Amiangshu] Wayne State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Detroit, MI 48202 USA","Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET); Wayne State University","Chakraborty, P (corresponding author), Bangladesh Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Dhaka, Bangladesh.","shuvopartho@gmail.com; rifat@cse.buet.ac.bd; anindya@cse.buet.ac.bd; amiangshu.bosu@wayne.edu","Bosu, Amiangshu/AAB-1259-2020","","","","","","23","22","22","1","9","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-5823-1","","","","2018","","","","","","","","","28","10.1145/3239235.3240298","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3239235.3240298","","","10","Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BM8PJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000469776800028","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency next to Bitcoin, is the first to provide a Turing-complete language to specify transaction processing, thereby enabling so-called smart contracts. This provides an opportune setting for attackers, as security vulnerabilities are tightly intertwined with financial gain. In this paper, we consider the problem of automatic vulnerability identification and exploit generation for smart contracts. We develop a generic definition of vulnerable contracts and use this to build TEETHER, a tool that allows creating an exploit for a contract given only its binary bytecode. We perform a large-scale analysis of all 38,757 unique Ethereum contracts, 815 out of which our tool finds working exploits for-completely automated.","[Krupp, Johannes; Rossow, Christian] Saarland Univ, CISPA, Saarland Informat Campus, Saarbrucken, Germany","Saarland University","Krupp, J (corresponding author), Saarland Univ, CISPA, Saarland Informat Campus, Saarbrucken, Germany.","","Krupp, Johannes/AAY-8398-2021","Krupp, Johannes/0000-0002-5106-3736","European Union [700176]","European Union(European Commission)","We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments.

Since Bitcoin main way of operating is based on broadcast communications, e.g. all transactions of the currency reach all network peers, how to achieve scalability is one of the most important concerns for it to achieve wide usage. One of the proposals to improve its scalability takes the form of the Lightning Network (LN) which consists of an overlay network on top of the base Bitcoin layer. Such an overlay allows to perform a new kind of off-blockchain transactions, i.e. transactions not broadcast to the entire network, that, differently from previous off-blockchain solutions, do not require to put trust in any third entity. Important open problems of the LN are i) defining how payments should be routed and ii) establishing which fee policies intermediate nodes should apply for forwarding payments. The contributions of this work are twofold: we first propose a new, more general, way for nodes to apply fees for forwarding payments which allows to keep the network balanced and improve its performance in the long term. Secondly, we propose a new multipath routing payment scheme, based on the atomic multipath payment method, which is able to significantly reduce the fees paid by users, while being fast and also able to keep the network balanced.","[Di Stasi, Giovanni; Avallone, Stefano; Canonico, Roberto; Ventre, Giorgio] Univ Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy","University of Naples Federico II","Di Stasi, G (corresponding author), Univ Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy.","giovanni.distasi@unina.it; stefano.avallone@unina.it; roberto.canonico@unina.it; giorgio.ventre@unina.it","","Avallone, Stefano/0000-0002-6871-8532","","","","","7","15","15","4","11","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-7975-3","","","","2018","","","","","","","1161","1170","","10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00209","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00209","","","10","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BN4AE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000481634500175","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The hardware-based wallet is safe, but it is inconvenient because users need to carry an additional physical device, the software-based wallet is convenient, but the safety cannot be guaranteed. All these wallets need to synchronize the blockchain, while most current mobile devices do not have the capability to store all blocks. To solve these problems, mobile devices can use simplified payment verification (SPV). Nevertheless, in existing methods, there is no good way to protect the verification process of the transaction. In this paper, we design a secure blockchain lightweight wallet based on Trustzone to protect SPV. It is more portable compared with the hardware wallet, and safer than the software wallet. Through the isolation, it can also protect the private key and the wallet's address from being stolen by the attackers no matter whether the Rich OS is malicious or not.

The data stored become part of the history of Bitcoin's blockchain, which after some time, becomes very tamper resistant, an attribute that many applications find of great use, e.g. document notary systems, asset meta-protocols, etc. However, many use cases require the functionality to revoke (cancel the validity) of the stored data. Previous attempts to handle revocation were not adequate. Since tamper resistance is a default attribute one needs a nonsystemic approach to deal with revocation, which usually implies additional infrastructure to accomplish it. This paper reviews several revocation methodologies together with advantages and disadvantages for each one, as well as proposes a simple and clean solution for revocation without any additional infrastructure or third-party dependencies.","[Karasavvas, Konstantinos] Univ Nicosia, Blockchain Initiat, Nicosia, Cyprus","University of Nicosia","Karasavvas, K (corresponding author), Univ Nicosia, Blockchain Initiat, Nicosia, Cyprus.","karasavvas.k@unic.ac.cy","","","","","","","6","3","3","0","4","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-7204-4","","","","2018","","","","","","","105","111","","10.1109/CVCBT.2018.00019","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CVCBT.2018.00019","","","7","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BM6IA","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000466595100014","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We propose a digital transfer system based on a variant of the Bitcoin ledger that is meant to support deterministic small payments with enforced proportional transaction fees: to achieve this property, we renounce the persistence of balances expected of a cryptocurrency, thus mitigating currency hoarding.

The rise of Bitcoin has brought attention not only to digital currencies but also to the underlying technology empowering digital currencies: blockchain technology. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records and secures transactions in a peer-to-peer network. Besides empowering digital currencies, blockchain technology has given innovators the capability of creating digital tokens to represent scarce assets, potentially reshaping the landscape of entrepreneurship and innovation. Blockchain tokens may democratize (1) entrepreneurship by giving entrepreneurs new ways to raise funds and engage stakeholders, and (2) innovation by giving innovators a new way to develop, deploy, and diffuse decentralized applications. Blockchain technology and tokens have sparked a new wave of innovation, which may start to revolutionize entrepreneurship and innovation. (C) 2018 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

First, several key requirements for software tools to simulate Blockchain are identified.

We also redesigned the block-generating algorithm to accelerate generating block. Our framework can reach nearly linear scalability with scale of service network while tolerating no more than 1/4 adaptive byzantine adversaries. Furthermore, we designed simulation experiments with up to 1000 virtual nodes to proof our theoretical scaling properties. In our experiments, our model performs better than Bitcoin-NG when the size of network more than around 400 nodes. But delay in Bitcoin-NG grows far more than ours.

Maybe it is time for a massive innovation in financial sector. Cryptocurrencies are seen by many as this massive innovation. On one hand it can be a huge benefit for people who can make fast payments, with relatively low fees and high security to anyone around the world. On the other hand, the offered anonymity and decentralized network can be abused by grey economy with money laundering or tax evasion. Even some criminals have shown interest in cryptocurrency and its possible use in drug, weapons and other illegal trade. Either way, cryptocurrencies are happening, and it may soon signal a new dawn of economy. For now, mainstream investors views cryptocurrencies as too volatile, difficult to analyze and the prize of cryptocurrencies are determined mainly per demand, which makes difficult for these companies to invest here other people's money. However, the rich families and persons view cryptocurrency as a perfect independent way to enlarge their funds. This paper offers a few insights in the world of cryptocurrency with basic theoretical background and statistics about important events and developments happening in this year. The conclusions of statistical research are in this paper shown in graphs and tables. The objective of this paper is to clarify functioning of cryptocurrency system and based on data obtained from publicly accessible sources research and evaluate the events and development that has happened in cryptocurrency so far this year.","[Katrencik, Ivan] Comenius Univ, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia; [Zatrochova, Monika] Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Radlinskeho 9, Bratislava 81237, Slovakia","Comenius University Bratislava; Slovak University of Technology Bratislava","Katrencik, I (corresponding author), Comenius Univ, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia.","ivan.katrencik@fm.uniba.sk; monika.zatrochova@stuba.sk","Katrencik, Ivan/AAJ-1169-2021","","","","","","15","0","0","0","4","NEWTON ACAD AS","PRAHA 1","POLITICKYCH VEZNU 10, PRAHA 1, 110 00, CZECH REPUBLIC","","","978-80-87325-12-4","","","","2018","","","","","","","64","72","","","","","","9","Business, Finance; Economics","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics","BQ1LR","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000576786300006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Because of its possible applications, cryptocurrency draws significant attention from researchers. Although there are a number of risks (e.g., speculation, 51% attack) related to cryptocurrency, billions of dollars are invested in them, because of transparency, traceability, low transaction cost, and highly profitable potential. In December 2017, the most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has reached almost $20,000.00 per coin. Such short-term, high gain potential attracts many new small investors. However, speculative movements raise many questions related to safety and privacy, just to name a few. In order to understand public opinion about cryptocurrency and to protect small investors financial interests, sentiment analysis can be done by using social media activities of individuals who are interested or investing in cryptocurrencies. One of the most important steps in the analysis is to understand the profiles of the users. Therefore, in this paper, we determine education levels of investors or users who are interested in eight cryptocurrencies by using seven readability techniques on Reddit comments as a part of profiling. Results show that the education levels of users are approximately 60% in middle school, 30% in high school, and 10% in other levels according to the average of the seven readability technique results. The results and analysis, which are provided in this paper, help new investors and developers to obtain profile information about the users who are interested or investing in cryptocurrency.","[Narman, Husnu S.; Uulu, Alymbek Damir] Marshall Univ, Weisberg Div Comp Sci, Huntington, WV 25755 USA; [Liu, Jinwei] Univ Cent Florida, Inst Simulat & Training, Orlando, FL 32826 USA","Marshall University; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida","Narman, HS (corresponding author), Marshall Univ, Weisberg Div Comp Sci, Huntington, WV 25755 USA.","narman@marshall.edu; damiruulu@marshall.edu; jliu@ist.ucf.edu","Narman, Husnu/Q-1038-2016","Narman, Husnu/0000-0003-0788-6265","","","","","19","3","3","2","10","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2162-7843","","978-1-5386-7568-7","IEEE INT SYMP SIGNAL","","","2018","","","","","","","229","234","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BM3PX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000462529100042","View Full Record in Web of Science"

To get realistic insights, we based our study on empirical Bitcoin transaction patterns and existing LN structure, and apply a simple form of fee structure with only one tunable parameter, a, that is most influential on the transaction routing paths. We assume the transactions through the LN take the path of the lowest aggregate fees, and found as a consequence that one cannot have short average path lengths and low overall channel imbalances at the same time. A good compromise is to have fees proportional to the square root of the channel capacity, such that reasonably short path lengths and overall balanced channel capacities can be achieved that makes the operation of the LN more sustainable.","[Ren, Alvin Heng Jun; Feng, Ling; Goh, Rick Siow Mong] ASTAR, Inst High Performance Comp, Dept Comp Sci, Singapore 138632, Singapore; [Ren, Alvin Heng Jun; Cheong, Siew Ann] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Phys & Math Sci, Singapore 637371, Singapore; [Feng, Ling] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Phys, Singapore 117551, Singapore; [Cheong, Siew Ann] Nanyang Technol Univ, Complex Inst, Singapore 637723, Singapore","Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC); Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; National University of Singapore; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University","Feng, L (corresponding author), ASTAR, Inst High Performance Comp, Dept Comp Sci, Singapore 138632, Singapore.;Feng, L (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Phys, Singapore 117551, Singapore.","felney@gmail.com","Feng, Ling/ABD-1751-2020; Cheong, Siew Ann/B-6991-2011","Feng, Ling/0000-0001-6578-2558; Cheong, Siew Ann/0000-0002-8589-6699","","","","","20","3","3","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1521-9097","","978-1-5386-7308-9","INT C PAR DISTRIB SY","","","2018","","","","","","","980","985","","10.1109/ICPADS.2018.00130","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2018.00130","","","6","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BM4AP","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000462962600119","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Once compromised, the attacker can copy the exchange's wallet (i.e. a set of cryptographic private keys) and appropriate all its coins. The largest heist so far occurred in February 2014 when Mt. Gox lost 850k bitcoins and unlike the conventional banking system, all theft transactions were irreversibly confirmed by the Bitcoin network. We observe that exchanges have adopted an overwhelmingly preventive approach to security which by itself has not yet proven to be sufficient. For example, two exchanges called NiceHash and YouBit collectively lost around 8.7k bitcoins in December 2017. Instead of preventing theft, we propose a reactive measure (inspired by Bitcoin vaults) which provides a fail-safe mechanism to detect the heist, freeze all withdrawals and allow an exchange to bring a trusted vault key online to recover from the compromise. In the event this trusted recovery key is also compromised, the exchange can deploy a nuclear option of destroying all coins.","[McCorry, Patrick] UCL, London, England; [Moser, Malte] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Ali, Syed Taha] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Islamabad, Pakistan","University of London; University College London; Princeton University; National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan","McCorry, P (corresponding author), UCL, London, England.","p.mccorry@ucl.ac.uk; mmoeser@cs.princeton.edu; taha.ali@seecs.nust.edu.pk","","","","","","","32","7","7","0","2","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-03251-7; 978-3-030-03250-0","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","11286","","","","","","225","233","","10.1007/978-3-030-03251-7_27","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-03251-7_27","","","9","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BR8PL","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000672735800027","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, the data volume of blockchain grows continuously due to the features that cannot be deleted and can only be added. Currently, the total size of Bitcoin blockchain ledger has reached 200GB. Its high demand for storage space and bandwidth to synchronize data with the network prevents many nodes from joining the network. This is not only not conducive to the expansion of this decentralized network, but also becomes the bottleneck of the development of blockchain technolop% This paper proposes an IPFS-based blockchain data storage model to solve this problem. In this paper, the miners deposit the transaction data into the IPFS network and pack the returned IPFS hash of transaction into the block. Utilizing the characteristics of the IDES network and the features of the IPFS hash, the blockchain data is greatly reduced. The scheme is applied to the Bitcoin blockchain. According to the experimental results, the compression ratio can reach 0.0817. According to the analysis, it also has good performance in terms of security and synchronization speed of new node.","[Zheng, Qiuhong; Li, Yi; Chen, Ping] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Dong, Xinghua] Ind & Commercial Bank China, Beijing, Peoples R China","Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC)","Zheng, QH (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.","13121777388@163.com; liyi@bupt.edu.cn; 13611349651@139.com; 87471379@qq.com","","","","","","","13","70","79","6","27","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-7325-6","","","","2018","","","","","","","704","708","","10.1109/WI.2018.000-8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WI.2018.000-8","","","5","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Software Engineering","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BM0PB","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000458968200107","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Blockchain is a collection of several techniques like cryptology, P2P and distributed consensus protocol. The main idea of Blockchain is that nodes in the network keep the same distributed ledger. Because of this immutable ledger, a trusted bridge is built among parties without fully trust. Blockchain can be used in variety of areas, especially in financial fields, like supply chain management, cross-border payment and global bank settlement. Meanwhile, we can observe that mobile network is growing rapidly and nibbling the PC market. However, the current public Blockchain applications like Bitcoin or Ethereum require the nodes to store the whole ledger which exceeds the capacity of the mobile devices. Thus, we need to develop a blockchain platform to support mobile devices. In this demo, we introduce Jupiter, a mobile-based Blockchain platform which provides a novel concept called consensus unit (CU) to alleviate the storage problem of mobile. We present the system architecture and demonstrate several CU scenarios via Jupiter.","[Han, Siyuan; Xu, Zihuan; Chen, Lei] HKUST, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Hong Kong University of Science & Technology","Han, SY (corresponding author), HKUST, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.","shanaj@connect.ust.hk; zxuav@connect.ust.hk; leichen@cse.ust.hk","","","Hong Kong RGC Project [16202215]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China [2015B010110006]; NSFC [61729201, 61232018]; Microsoft Research Asia Collaborative Grant; NSFC Guang Dong Grant [U1301253]","Hong Kong RGC Project; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Microsoft Research Asia Collaborative Grant(Microsoft); NSFC Guang Dong Grant","This work is supported in part by the Hong Kong RGC Project 16202215, Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China, No. 2015B010110006, NSFC Grant No. 61729201, 61232018, Microsoft Research Asia Collaborative Grant and NSFC Guang Dong Grant No. U1301253","","7","6","7","0","4","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1084-4627","","978-1-5386-5520-7","PROC INT CONF DATA","","","2018","","","","","","","1649","1652","","10.1109/ICDE.2018.00198","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2018.00198","","","4","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO0OZ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000492836500190","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Traditional Blockchain architecture can provide decentralized and trustworthy systems for financial services with persistency, anonymity, and auditability guaranteed. Internet of Things (IoT), as the next promising smart system, has the similar decentralized topology with Blockchain. However, deploying Blockchain in IoT system is still unpractical in many aspects. In this paper, we first point out the practical obstacles to deploy Blockchain topology in IoT system. Then a dynamic Blockchain based trust system is proposed to provide a dynamic and scalable communication architecture for IoT networks. We also present a case study to further discuss the security issues and provide future research directions.","[Qiu, Han; Memmi, Gerard] Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France; [Qiu, Meikang; Ming, Zhong] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Liu, Meiqin] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Elect Engn, Hangzhou, Peoples R China","IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Shenzhen University; Zhejiang University","Qiu, MK (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.","han.qiu@telecom-paristeh.fr; mqiu@szu.edu.cn; gerard.memmi@telecom-paristeh.fr; mingz@szu.edu.cn; liumeigin@zju.edu.cn","","Qiu, Han/0000-0003-2678-8070","","","","","17","99","99","1","2","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-05764-0; 978-3-030-05763-3","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","11373","","","","","","159","166","","10.1007/978-3-030-05764-0_17","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-05764-0_17","","","8","Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT6QU","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000843068400017","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Applications of blockchain range from cryptocurrency, smart contract, banking, healthcare and identity management, insurance, land registry to IoT industry. However, scalability and throughput issues are major challenges of blockchain and are less researched. Many lightweight nodes especially IoT devices depend and put much workload on blockchain servers since they cannot store the full blockchain due to its huge size. This paper investigates performance bottlenecks in blockchain and presents efficient high performance system for caching the blockchain data in the FPGA network interface controller (NIC) for improving scalability and throughput of blockchain applications. We design a customized SHA-256 hash core specific for efficient blockchain caching to save hashing executions and improve the performance. We built and use Jansson and Curl libraries to interface our system with real Bitcoin core. We finally evaluate the throughput performance of the Bitcoin core. The overall result revealed that our system improves the throughput performance by 103 times when cache hit. The design also offers small work area utilization, low power consumption and higher performance.","[Sanka, Abdurrashid Ibrahim; Cheung, Ray C.

These problems are exactly what the traditional centralized architecture can solve. At the same time, in order to improve the distributed consensus efficiency, consensus algorithms such as Proof of stake, delegated proof of stake, proof of space, proof of authority, and PBFT have emerged from Bitcoin's Pow consensus mechanism. These consensus algorithms have their own advantages and Disadvantages. Disadvantages, such as Pos, DPos can improve transaction efficiency, PBFT can improve the fairness of voting, but at the same time POS also bring benefits and voting rights to hold a lot of user tilt issues to a small number of tokens, PBFT brings about a low cost of malicious user attacks and other issues. In order to effectively take advantage of the high security, high reliability of the blockchain, and high efficiency of traditional centralized architectures, and fully utilizing existing consensus mechanisms, this paper presents an innovative hybrid blockchain approach, which mixed the blockchain architecture, Hybrid-chain, consists of the following three type nodes in the architecture: service center nodes responsible for efficient transaction confirmation, dynamic transaction verification nodes participating in transactions, and random verification nodes responsible for transaction fairness verification. On the consensus mechanism, the consensus algorithm selects the corresponding consensus mechanism according to the transaction characteristics. Experiments show that compared with the traditional blockchain architecture, hybrid chain has obvious performance advantages in transaction sending, transaction confirmation and block information storage, which can greatly reduce the transaction sending time by 96%, shorten the confirmation time by 95%, and reduce the number of 79. % Block information storage space, etc.","[Wang, Yunpeng; Zhang, Fan] Sichuan Univ, Coll Comp, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Hui; Li, Tao; Li, Zhiyong] Sichuan Univ, Coll Cybersecur, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yunpeng] Southwest China Inst Elect Technol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Sichuan University; Sichuan University","Zhao, H; Li, T (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Coll Cybersecur, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.","","王, 运鹏/U-9628-2019","","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFB0800600]; Natural Science Foundation of China [U1736212, 61572334]; Sichuan Province Key Research and Development Project of China [2018GZ0183]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [YJ201727]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Sichuan Province Key Research and Development Project of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This work is supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFB0800600) Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. U1736212 and No. 61572334) and Sichuan Province Key Research and Development Project of China (Grant No. 2018GZ0183) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. YJ201727).","","27","0","0","0","8","ATLANTIS PRESS","PARIS","29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE","2352-5401","","978-94-6252-538-2","AER ADV ENG RES","","","2018","127","","","","","","262","268","","","","","","7","Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Engineering, Mechanical","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering","BL5TM","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000452668800055","View Full Record in Web of Science"

For example, it takes several hours for BitCoin and several minutes for Ethereum. These cryptocurrencies also consume a high quantity of electricity for transaction validation. Even though there currently is a type of cryptocurrencies, Ripple, that can be quickly transferred in 4 seconds but still it is a closed system with an owner, not a public cryptocurrency. Similarly, an algorithm Proof of Stake used by new coins that are more energy-saving but several problems are still found including (1) 51% attack, (2) a richer with more coins gains higher rewards, and (3) a problematic node for block validation that is not currently active.

Considering the growing interest in the use of Bitcoins through blockchain technology, we argue that the lack of studies on social influence on Bitcoins adoption will contribute significantly to bridge a gap in the literature and provide a research opportunity to contextualise the effect of social influence and broaden its dimensions to include several influence channels.

Nowadays, collaborative engineering is gaining tremendous popularity, especially in the information technology industry. In the future, technological giants may have to work with each other to complete large projects of great importance and significance. In such projects, trust management is crucial. With multiple parties involved in such projects, it is important that no party monopolizes the project and adds patches which are not known to the other parties. In addition, no party should have the authority to disclose the full contents of the work to a third party. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based solution to the above issues. The only authentic version of the project would be the one maintained in the blockchain. Collaborators would broadcast the changes they make, and it would be added to the blockchain only after consensus from all parties. We use a threshold key system on private keys so that consensus is achieved.

The proposed iShare framework leverages the Blockchain concept used in Bitcoin systems where multiple organizations/agencies participate for information sharing (without violating their privacy) to secure and monitor their cyberspace. Note that the Bitcoin for financial transactions has already demonstrated that there is a trusted, auditable sharing with peer-to-peer communications accompanied by a public ledger. The main aim of the Blockchain-based iShare framework is to constantly collect high-resolution, cyber-attack information across organizational boundaries of which the organizations have no specific knowledge or control over any other organizations' data or damage caused by cyber-attacks. In the proposed iShare framework, the decentralized nature of the Blockchain and digitally signed transactions ensure that an adversary cannot pose as a legitimate organization/user or cannot control/hamper the system because of the digital-signatures and cannot learn anything from the public ledger that has just hashed pointers. Moreover, we analyze the security attacks by outsiders (not participating in the iShare) using a Stackelberg game.","[Rawat, Danda B.] Howard Univ, EECS Dept, Washington, DC 20059 USA; [Njilla, Laurent; Kwiat, Kevin] US Air Force, Res Lab, Cyber Assurance Branch, Rome, NY USA; [Kamhoua, Charles] US Army, Res Lab, Network Secur Branch, Adelphi, MD USA","Howard University; United States Department of Defense; United States Air Force; United States Department of Defense; US Army Research, Development & Engineering Command (RDECOM); US Army Research Laboratory (ARL)","Rawat, DB (corresponding author), Howard Univ, EECS Dept, Washington, DC 20059 USA.","danda.rawat@howard.edu; laurent.njilla@us.af.mil; kevin.kwiat@us.af.mil; charles.a.kamhoua.civ@mail.mil","Rawat, Danda B/B-2973-2012","Rawat, Danda B/0000-0003-3638-3464","AFRL; NSF [CNS 1650831, CNS 1658972]","AFRL(United States Department of DefenseUS Air Force Research Laboratory); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","Work of Danda B.

The public availability of transaction histories offers an opportunity to analyze and compare different cryptocurrencies. In this paper, we present a dynamic network analysis of three representative blockchain-based cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Namecoin. By analyzing the accumulated network growth, we find that, unlike most other networks, these cryptocurrency networks do not always densify over time, and they are changing all the time with relatively low node and edge repetition ratios. Therefore, we then construct separate networks on a monthly basis, trace the changes of typical network characteristics (including degree distribution, degree assortativity, clustering coefficient, and the largest connected component) over time, and compare the three. We find that the degree distribution of these monthly transaction networks cannot be well fitted by the famous power-law distribution, at the same time, different currency still has different network properties, e.g., both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks are heavy-tailed with disassortative mixing, however, only the former can be treated as a small world. These network properties reflect the evolutionary characteristics and competitive power of these three cryptocurrencies and provide a foundation for future research.","[Liang, Jiaqi; Li, Linjing; Zeng, Daniel] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, State Key Lab Management & Control Complex Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liang, Jiaqi; Zeng, Daniel] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Comp & Control Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Daniel] Univ Arizona, Dept Management Informat Syst, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Automation, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Arizona","Liang, JQ; Li, LJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, State Key Lab Management & Control Complex Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Liang, JQ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Comp & Control Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.","liangjiaqi2014@ia.ac.cn; linjing.li@ia.ac.cn","","Liang, Jiaqi/0000-0003-4977-4093; deauna, paul/0000-0002-8066-2893","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0820105, 2016QY02D0305]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71621002, U1435221]; Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [ZDRW-XH-2017-3]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences)","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant (Nos. 2017YFC0820105 to L.L., 2016QY02D0305 to D.Z., http://www.most.gov.cn/kjjh/), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71621002 to D.Z., U1435221 to L.L., http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/), and the Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences under Grant (No. ZDRW-XH-2017-3 to D.Z., http://www.compsys.ia.ac.cn/).

Blockchains promise the ability to maintain critical information in a trustworthy repository without any centralized management. The reliability of blockchain-enabled applications is based on the innate immutability of stored data, maintained through cryptographic means, which enables blockchains to provide transparency, efficiency, auditability, trust, and security. As the technology is still in its infancy, a number of pain points must be addressed in order to make distributed ledgers more dependable, scalable, and pervasive. In this paper, we present the research landscape in distributed ledger technology (DLT). To do so, we describe a taxonomy of blockchain applications called blockchain generations. We also present the DCS properties (Decentralization, Consistency, and Scalability) as an analogy to the CAP theorem. Furthermore, we provide a general structure of the blockchain platform which decomposes the distributed ledger into six layers: Application, Modeling, Contract, System, Data, and Network. Finally, we classify research angles across three dimensions: DCS properties impacted, targeted applications, and related layers.","[Zhang, Kaiwen] Ecole Technol Super, Middleware Syst Res Grp, Montreal, PQ, Canada; Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany","University of Quebec; Ecole de Technologie Superieure - Canada; University of Toronto; Technical University of Munich","Zhang, KW (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, Middleware Syst Res Grp, Montreal, PQ, Canada.","","","","Alexander von Humboldt foundation","Alexander von Humboldt foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation)","This research is supported by the Alexander von Humboldt foundation.","","40","44","46","0","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1063-6927","","978-1-5386-6871-9","INT CON DISTR COMP S","","","2018","","","","","","","1337","1346","","10.1109/ICDCS.2018.00134","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2018.00134","","","10","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BP1XF","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000541051900124","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Such features can be brought by blockchain, a technology born with a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. In this paper, a thorough review on how to adapt blockchain to the specific needs of IoT in order to develop Blockchain-based IoT (BIoT) applications is presented. After describing the basics of blockchain, the most relevant BIoT applications are described with the objective of emphasizing how blockchain can impact traditional cloud-centered IoT applications. Then, the current challenges and possible optimizations are detailed regarding many aspects that affect the design, development, and deployment of a BIoT application. Finally, some recommendations are enumerated with the aim of guiding future BIoT researchers and developers on some of the issues that will have to be tackled before deploying the next generation of BIoT applications.","[Fernandez-Carames, Tiago M.; Fraga-Lamas, Paula] Univ A Coruna, Fac Comp Sci, Dept Comp Engn, Campus Elvina S-N, La Coruna 15071, Spain","Universidade da Coruna","Fernandez-Carames, TM; Fraga-Lamas, P (corresponding author), Univ A Coruna, Fac Comp Sci, Dept Comp Engn, Campus Elvina S-N, La Coruna 15071, Spain.","tiago.fernandez@udc.es; paula.fraga@udc.es","Fraga-Lamas, Paula/G-2499-2016; Caramés, Tiago M.

The underlying technology that enables Bitcoin (or more generally crypto-currency) is called blockchain. At the core of the blockchain technology is a data structure that keeps record of the transactions in the network. The special feature that distinguishes it from existing technology is its immutability of the stored records. To achieve immutability, it uses consensus and cryptographic mechanisms. As the data is stored in distributed nodes this technology is also termed as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). As many researchers and practitioners are joining the hype of blockchain, some of them are raising the question about the fundamental difference between blockchain and traditional database and its real value or potential. In this paper, we present a critical analysis of both technologies based on a survey of the research literature where blockchain solutions are applied to various scenarios. Based on this analysis, we further develop a decision tree diagram that will help both practitioners and researchers to choose the appropriate technology for their use cases. Using our proposed decision tree we evaluate a sample of the existing works to see to what extent the blockchain solutions have been used appropriately in the relevant problem domains.","[Chowdhury, Mohammad Jabed Morshed; Colman, Alan; Han, Jun; Sarda, Paul] Swinburne Univ Technol, Sch Software & Elect Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Kabir, Muhammad Ashad] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Comp & Math, Bathurst, NSW, Australia","Swinburne University of Technology; Charles Sturt University","Chowdhury, MJM (corresponding author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Sch Software & Elect Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.","mjchowdhury@swin.edu.au; acolman@swin.edu.au; akabir@csu.edu.au; jhan@swin.edu.au; 4949501@swin.edu.au","Chowdhury, Jabed/AAD-6940-2019; Kabir, Ashad/AAY-8323-2020","Chowdhury, Jabed/0000-0003-4476-8882; Colman, Alan/0000-0003-0264-9965; Kabir, Muhammad Ashad/0000-0002-6798-6535","","","","","22","36","37","0","5","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2324-9013","","978-1-5386-4387-7","IEEE TRUST","","","2018","","","","","","","1348","1353","","10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00186","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00186","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO1DM","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000495072100177","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The authors have come to the following conclusions. The use of cryptocurrencies is a promising way to maintain economic development by applying modern accounting and information technologies. International experience clearly demonstrates the importance and role of cryptocurrencies in the activities of transnational criminal groups relating to the financing of terrorism and human trafficking. In the context of globalisation and implementation of the European integration in Ukraine, the turnover of cryptocurrencies needs to be regulated at the legislative level. Thus, it is necessary to accelerate the approval of the Draft Law On the turnover of cryptocurrency in Ukraine No. 7183 as of 06 October 2017. It is advisable to introduce a system of registration (licencing) of crypto-currency exchange and exchangers at the national level. At the same time, it is necessary to impose an obligation on cryptoexchangers to collect information about customers. Also, it is necessary to regulate activities of companies that sell goods and services to customers for cryptocurrency, as it is accepted by PayPal, Braintree and other payment systems.","[Lukianchuk, Ruslan; Grebeniuk, Maksym; Cherniak, Andrii] Natl Secur & Def Council Ukraine, Interagency Sci & Res Ctr Problems Combating Orga, 1 Solomyanska Sq, UA-03035 Kiev, Ukraine","","Lukianchuk, R (corresponding author), Natl Secur & Def Council Ukraine, Interagency Sci & Res Ctr Problems Combating Orga, 1 Solomyanska Sq, UA-03035 Kiev, Ukraine.","lukianchuk.Ruslan@rada.gov.ua; max-felix@ukr.net; ironsteel1997@gmail.com","","Grebeniyk, Maksym/0000-0003-1249-5576","","","","","15","2","2","2","32","INST SOC TRANSFORMATION","KYIV","VUL GONCHARA 43-V, OFIS 20, KYIV, 01030, UKRAINE","1728-6220","1728-6239","","ECON ANN-XXI","Econ.

Besides, a transaction should wait a quite long time (about 10 min on average) before being confirmed on the blockchain, which makes micropayments not cost-effective. In CCS'15, Pass and shelat proposed three novel micropayment schemes for any ledger-based transaction system, using the idea of probabilistic payments suggested by Wheeler (1996) and Rivest (1997), which are called as the Lottery-based Micropayments. However, the one among the three schemes, which is fully compatible with the current Bitcoin system and only requires an invisible verifiable third party, needs two on-chain transactions during each execution, even if both the user and the merchant are honest. To reduce the transaction costs and increase efficiency, this paper proposes a fast lottery-based micropayment scheme to improve their work. By setting up a time-locked deposit, whose secure utilization is assured by the security of a primitive called accountable assertions under the discrete logarithm assumption, our scheme reduces the number of on-chain transactions to one, and yet maintains the original scheme's advantages.","[Hu, Kexin; Zhang, Zhenfeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Software, Lab Trusted Comp & Informat Assurance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hu, Kexin; Zhang, Zhenfeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Software, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Hu, KX (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Software, Lab Trusted Comp & Informat Assurance, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Hu, KX (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.","hukexin@tca.iscas.ac.cn; zfzhang@tca.iscas.ac.cn","","","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0802500, 2017YFB0802000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1536205]","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","We thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments which helped to improve the paper.

Seminars and conferences have been organized to discuss the nature and feasibility of cryptocurrencies. Some argue that it is good to have an alternative to the current fiat money system in which the predominant role is played by banks, while a cryptocurrency does not require any bank account, tax payment and auditing. Some others disagree with these arguments and claim that any mode of payment in other than traditionally known instruments such as cash payment, telegraphic-transfers, cheques and so, will open the door to avoid tax and audits, which in turn may seriously effect a government's budget and may even decrease GDP. This research uses theoretical, descriptive and analytical methods of research and therefore focuses on the following important points: a) defining the place of cryptocurrency in the financial system by determining the extent of its influence; b) reviewing the literature on the topic, which will allow us to determine the current understanding of the problem by modern science; c) unveiling the key requirements of Shari'ah for money and money circulation to formulate a standard understanding of money in Shari'ah; d) comparing the characteristics of paper money and crypto-currencies (using the bitcoins as an example).

The novel integration of technology and economy that open public blockchains have brought represents both challenges to and opportunities for enhancing digital public services. So far, the public sector has lagged behind other sectors in both research and exploration of this technology, but pilot cases show that there is a great potential for reforming and even transforming public service delivery. We argue that the open blockchain technology is best understood as a possible information infrastructure, given its universal, evolving, open and transparent nature. A comparison with Internet is meaningful despite obvious differences between the two. Based on some case studies, we have developed an analytical framework for better understanding the potential benefits as well as the existing challenges when introducing blockchain technology in the public sector.","[Olnes, Svein] Western Norway Res Inst, Sogndal, Norway; [Jansen, Arild] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway","University of Oslo","Olnes, S (corresponding author), Western Norway Res Inst, Sogndal, Norway.","sol@vestforsk.no; arildj@jus.uio.no","","","","","","","44","9","9","1","6","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-6526-0","","","","2018","","","","","","","657","666","","10.1145/3209281.3209293","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3209281.3209293","","","10","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Public Administration","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Computer Science; Public Administration","BO3SF","","Bronze, Green Published","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000511427500077","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Initial blog posts on average received US$0.01, although the maximum accrued was US$20,680.83. Longer, more sentiment-rich or more positive comments with personal information received the greatest financial reward in contrast to more informational or topical content. Thus, there is a clear financial value in starting with a friendly introduction rather than immediately attempting to provide useful content, despite the latter being the ultimate site goal. Follow-up posts also tended to be more successful when more personal, suggesting that interpersonal communication rather than quality content provision has driven the site so far. It remains to be seen whether the model of small typical rewards and the possibility that a post might generate substantially more are enough to incentivise long-term participation or a greater focus on informational posts in the long term.","[Thelwall, Mike] Univ Wolverhampton, Stat Cybermetr Res Grp, Wolverhampton WV1 1LY, W Midlands, England","University of Wolverhampton","Thelwall, M (corresponding author), Univ Wolverhampton, Stat Cybermetr Res Grp, Wolverhampton WV1 1LY, W Midlands, England.","m.thelwall@wlv.ac.uk","Thelwall, Mike/C-1449-2013","Thelwall, Mike/0000-0001-6065-205X","","","","","72","13","13","1","58","SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD","LONDON","1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","0165-5515","1741-6485","","J INF SCI","J.

Because different PoW blockchains often share hashing algorithms, miners face a complex choice in deciding how to allocate their hash power among chains. We present an economic model that leverages Modern Portfolio Theory to predict a miner's allocation over time using price data and inferred risk tolerance. The model matches actual allocations with mean absolute error within 20% for four out of the top five miners active on both Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchains. A model of aggregate allocation across those four miners shows excellent agreement in magnitude with the actual aggregate as well a correlation coefficient of 0.649. The accuracy of the aggregate allocation model is also sufficient to explain major historical changes in inter-block time (IBT) for BCH. Because estimates of miner risk are not time-dependent and our model is otherwise price-driven, we are able to use it to anticipate the effect of a major price shock on hash allocation and IBT in the BCH blockchain. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we show that, despite mitigation by the new difficulty adjustment algorithm, a price drop of 50% could increase the IBT by 50% for at least a day, with a peak delay of 100%.","[Bissias, George; Levine, Brian N.] UMass Amherst, Coll Informat & Comp Sci, Amherst, MA USA; [Thibodeau, David] Florida Dept Correct, Tallahassee, FL USA","University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst","Bissias, G (corresponding author), UMass Amherst, Coll Informat & Comp Sci, Amherst, MA USA.","gbiss@cs.umass.edu; levine@cs.umass.edu; davidpthibodeau@gmail.com","","","","","","","19","2","2","0","3","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-00305-0; 978-3-030-00304-3","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","11025","","","","","","155","172","","10.1007/978-3-030-00305-0_12","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00305-0_12","","","18","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BN2ZL","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000477970100012","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Different from the proof-of-work based Bitcoin, our construction uses two types of resources, computing power and coins (i.e., stake). The blockchain in our system is more robust than that in a pure proof-of-work based system; even if the adversary controls the majority of mining power, we can still have the chance to secure the system by relying on honest stake. In contrast, Bitcoin blockchain will be insecure if the adversary controls more than 50% of mining power. Our design follows a recent provably secure proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid blockchain [11]. In order to make our construction practical, we considerably enhance its design. In particular, we introduce a new strategy for difficulty adjustment in the hybrid blockchain and provide a theoretical analysis of it. We also show how to construct a light client for proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies and evaluate the proposal practically. We implement our newdesign. Our implementation uses a recent modular development framework for blockchains, called Scorex. It allows us to change only certain parts of an application leaving other codebase intact.

However, due to their infancy, smart contracts still pose many challenges that encumber the stakeholders who interact with them: users, developers and the organisations that are built on top of smart contracts. This study aims to contribute to the body of knowledge of smart contracts within blockchain technology. Based on a systematic mapping study, we offer a broad perspective on their problems and corresponding solutions, present the research trends within the area and compile the 64 papers identified, grouped by top publication sources, channels, methods and approaches. We conclude that, since 2016, there has been an increasing trend towards the publication of blockchain-based smart contract articles at conferences and journals, mainly reflecting experiments and presenting methods, tools and models.

This paper contends that any effective regulation of this new ecosystem requires adoption of the machinery of more fundamental concepts and a clear direction. Even if the Government's skepticism about soundness of the cryptocurrency markets is fully justified, how best to protect the various parties in the market is a different issue, one which calls for urgent attention from policy makers, legal practitioners, the judiciary and academic researchers. In particular, given the increasing number of startup Indonesian companies that have scrambled for seats in the new market, and the large number of related criminal cases reported in other jurisdictions, often involving hacking or embezzlement, the urgency to study best policy practices cannot be stressed enough.

The mining process of Blockchain, however, incurs a heavy computational workload for miners to solve the proof-of-work puzzle (i.e., a series of the hashing computation), which is prohibitive from the perspective of the mobile terminals (MTs). The advanced multi-access mobile edge computing (MEC), which enables the MTs to offload part of the computational workloads (for solving the proof-of-work) to the nearby edge-servers (ESs), provides a promising approach to address this issue. By offloading the computational workloads via multi-access MEC, the MTs can effectively increase their successful probabilities when participating in the mining game and gain the consequent reward (i.e., winning the bitcoin). However, as a compensation to the ESs which provide the computational resources to the MTs, the MTs need to pay the ESs for the corresponding resource-acquisition costs. Thus, to investigate the trade-off between obtaining the computational resources from the ESs (for solving the proof-of-work) and paying for the consequent cost, we formulate an optimization problem in which the MTs determine their acquired computational resources from different ESs, with the objective of maximizing the MTs' social net-reward in the mining process while keeping the fairness among the MTs. In spite of the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we exploit its layered structure and propose efficient distributed algorithms for the MTs to individually determine their optimal computational resources acquired from different ESs. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and the performance of our proposed multi-access MEC for Blockchain.","[Wu, Yuan; Chen, Xiangxu; Shi, Jiajun; Ni, Kejie; Qian, Liping; Huang, Liang] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Informat Engn, Hangzhou 310023, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yuan] Xidian Univ, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks, Xian 710071, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Kuan] Univ Nebraska, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Omaha, NE 68182 USA","Zhejiang University of Technology; Xidian University; University of Nebraska System","Wu, Y (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Informat Engn, Hangzhou 310023, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;Wu, Y (corresponding author), Xidian Univ, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks, Xian 710071, Peoples R China.","iewuy@zjut.edu.cn; 2111703318@zjut.edu.cn; 2111703412@zjut.edu.cn; 2111703062@zjut.edu.cn; lpqian@zjut.edu.cn; lianghuang@zjut.edu.cn; kzhang22@unl.edu","Huang, Liang/AAE-4490-2020","Wu, Yuan/0000-0002-2777-7915; QIAN, Li Ping/0000-0001-6210-2617; Huang, Liang/0000-0001-6924-4466; Zhang, Kuan/0000-0002-4262-153X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61572440, 61872293]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LR17F010002, LR16F010003]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61572440, in part by the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants LR17F010002 and LR16F010003.

Conventional systems rely on the reputation of central authorities and record-keepers to achieve consensus. Blockchain, which powers Bitcoin, differs from conventional systems by achieving consensus through a community of anonymous (and therefore trustless) agents who compete amongst themselves to authenticate transactions. The promise of the blockchain protocol is that it is invulnerable to human foibles.

However, according to several recent researches, we know that it can only provide pseudonymity rather than real anonymity, and privacy has been one of the main concerns in the system similar to Bitcoin. Ring signature is a good method for those users who need better anonymity in cryptocurrency. It was first proposed by Rivest et al. based upon the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) assumption in 2006, which allows a user to sign a message anonymously on behalf of a group of users even without their coordination. The size of ring signature is one of the dominating parameters, and constant-size ring signature (where signature size is independent of the ring size) is much desirable. Otherwise, when the ring size is large, the resultant ring signature becomes unbearable for power limited devices or leads to heavy burden over the communication network. Though being extensively studied, currently there are only two approaches for constant-size ring signature. Achieving practical constant-size ring signature is a long-standing open problem since its introduction. In this work, we solve this open question. We present a new constant-size ring signature scheme based on bilinear pairing and accumulator, which is provably secure under the random oracle (RO) model. To the best of our knowledge, it stands for the most practical ring signature up to now.","[Zhao, Yun-Lei] Fudan Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Data Sci, Sch Comp Sci, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; Xidian Univ, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks, Xian 710126, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; State Cryptol Adm, State Key Lab Cryptol, Beijing 100878, Peoples R China","Fudan University; Xidian University","Zhao, YL (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Data Sci, Sch Comp Sci, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China.","mjqin16@fudan.edu.cn; ylzhao@fudan.edu.cn; zjma14@fudan.edu.cn","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0802000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61472084, U1536205]; Shanghai Innovation Action Project [16DZ1100200]; Shanghai Science and Technology Development Funds [6JC1400801]; Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program of China [2017CXG0701]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Innovation Action Project; Shanghai Science and Technology Development Funds; Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program of China","This work is supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant No. 2017YFB0802000, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 61472084 and U1536205, the Shanghai Innovation Action Project under Grant No. 16DZ1100200, the Shanghai Science and Technology Development Funds under Grant No. 6JC1400801, and the Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant No. 2017CXG0701.","","27","4","4","0","29","SCIENCE PRESS","BEIJING","16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA","1000-9000","1860-4749","","J COMPUT SCI TECH-CH","J.

In this model, a user visiting a website will download a JavaScript code that executes client-side in her browser, mines a cryptocurrency-typically without her consent or knowledge-and pays out the seigniorage to the website. Websites may consciously employ this as an alternative or to supplement advertisement revenue, may offer premium content in exchange for mining, or may be unwittingly serving the code as a result of a breach (in which case the seigniorage is collected by the attacker). The cryptocurrency Monero is preferred seemingly for its unfriendliness to large-scale ASIC mining that would drive browser-based efforts out of the market, as well as for its purported privacy features. In this paper, we survey this landscape, conduct some measurements to establish its prevalence and profitability, outline an ethical framework for considering whether it should be classified as an attack or business opportunity, and make suggestions for the detection, mitigation and/or prevention of browser-based mining for non-consenting users.","[Eskandari, Shayan; Leoutsarakos, Andreas; Clark, Jeremy] Concordia Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Mursch, Troy] Bad Packets Report, Chicago, IL USA","Concordia University - Canada","Eskandari, S (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.","","Eskandari, Shayan/O-7827-2018","Eskandari, Shayan/0000-0001-7405-9249","NSERC; FRQNT","NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); FRQNT","J.

Recently, many blockchains have been proposed to achieve scale-out throughput by letting nodes only acquire a fraction of the whole transaction set. However, these schemes, e.g., sharding and off-chain techniques, suffer from a degradation in decentralization or the capacity of fault tolerance. In this paper, we show that the complete set of transactions is not a necessity for the prevention of double-spending if the properties of value transfers is fully explored. In other words, we show that a value-transfer ledger like Bitcoin has the potential to scale-out by its nature without sacrificing security or decentralization. Firstly, we give a formal definition for the value-transfer ledger and its distinct features from a generic database. Then, we introduce the blockchain structure with a shared main chain for consensus and an individual chain for each node for recording transactions. A locally executable validation scheme is proposed with uncompromising validity and consistency. A beneficial consequence of our design is that nodes will spontaneously try to reduce their transmission cost by only providing the transactions needed to show that their transactions are not double spend. As a result, the network is sharded as each node only acquires part of the transaction record and a scale-out throughput could be achieved, which we call spontaneous sharding.","[Ren, Zhijie; Aerts, Taico V.; de Jonge, Bart.

Current blockchain projects in China are dominated by private or consortium blockchains that have their accessibility firmly controlled; for public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, access is free for all. Not surprisingly, by weakening state control of digital data, public blockchains may neutralise China's decades of efforts in building internet filtering systems. The existing development trajectory of private and consortium blockchains is likely to advance steadfastly, and citizens and companies in China may be required to use state-controlled blockchains.","[Liu Bojian] Natl Univ Singapore, East Asian Inst, Singapore, Singapore","National University of Singapore","Liu, BJ (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, East Asian Inst, Singapore, Singapore.","","","","","","","","2","1","1","1","11","WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD","SINGAPORE","5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE","1793-9305","2251-3175","","EAST ASIAN POLICY","East Asian Policy","OCT-DEC","2018","10","4","","","","","71","78","","10.1142/S1793930518000387","http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S1793930518000387","","","8","Political Science","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Government & Law","HI9ZJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000456816000006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Lykke is a FinTech company based in Zurich that has launched the global marketplace for all asset classes and instruments digitized on the blockchain. The authors discuss how the exchange will evolve over time. They explore the macroeconomic benefits of the new blockchain technology. The Lykke exchange is compatible with any type of public blockchain. Design/methodology/approach The authors present the architecture of an exchange for colored coins. By colored coins, they mean issuer-backed securities on the Bitcoin blockchain. Orders are collected and matched by a semi-trusted exchange. Matched orders are settled on the Bitcoin blockchain, where each successful trade between parties appears as a set atomic-colored coins swap transactions. Unfilled and expired orders are discarded. The exchange does not take possession of the traded coins, but needs to be trusted to match trades correctly. Findings Lykke has launched the exchange initially for the main currencies, cryptocurrencies and Lykke coin (entitlement to the shares of Lykke company). Perspective asset classes include futures and options on digital assets, crowd-funded loans for retail and private equity financing for small and medium-sized enterprises, contracts for difference, zero coupon bonds and other fixed income and natural capital bonds. Originality/value Lykke exchange and all its tools and services are open source; the transparency of technology is ideal for research.

Among these technologies, smart contract platforms have the potential to take over functions usually done by intermediaries like banks, escrow or legal services. In this paper, we introduce a novel protocol aiming to execute smart contracts as part of a blockchain transaction validation. We enable extensions in the execution of smart contracts while guaranteeing their privacy, correctness and verifiability. Man-in-the-middle attacks are prevented, since no communication between participants is requested, and contract validations do not imply the re-execution of the code by all the nodes in the network. However, proofs of correct execution are stored on the blockchain and can be verified by multiple parties. Our solution is based on programming tools which optimize the time execution and the required memory while preserving the embedded functionality.","[Covaci, Alexandra; Madeo, Simone; Motylinski, Patrick; Vincent, Stephane] nChain, London, England","","Covaci, A (corresponding author), nChain, London, England.","alexandra@ncrypt.com; simone@ncrypt.com; patrick@ncrypt.com; vincent@ncrypt.com","Sánchez-Gómez, Nicolás/K-3758-2014","","","","","","22","1","1","0","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-4503-5726-5","","","","2018","","","","","","","17","24","","10.1145/3194113.3194116","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3194113.3194116","","","8","Computer Science, Software Engineering","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BL6YE","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000454741800003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Unfortunately, new participants of the blockchain network are required to download the whole blockchain to gain an overview about the state of the system and to validate incoming transactions. Approaches like IOTA, SegWit or the Lightning Network try to solve the scalability issues of blockchain applications. Unfortunately, they focus on strategies slowing down the blockchain's growth instead of reducing the problems arising from a growing chain or introduce new concepts to oust the linear blockchain altogether. The approach proposed in this paper is based on the idea of Ethereum to keep the state of the system explicitly in the current block but further pursues this by including the relevant part of the current system state in new transactions as well. This enables other participants to validate incoming transactions without having to download the whole blockchain initially. Following this idea use cases can be supported that require scalable blockchain technology but not necessarily an indefinite and complete transaction history.","[Ehmke, Christopher; Wessling, Florian] Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany; [Ehmke, Christopher; Friedrich, Christoph M.] Univ Appl Sci & Arts Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany","University of Duisburg Essen","Ehmke, C (corresponding author), Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany.;Ehmke, C (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci & Arts Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany.","christopher.ehmke@uni-due.de; florian.wessling@uni-due.de; christoph.friedrich@fh-dortmund.de","Friedrich, Christoph M./N-8674-2017","Friedrich, Christoph M./0000-0001-7906-0038","European Union through the project CPS.HUB NRW, EFRE [0-4000-17]","European Union through the project CPS.HUB NRW, EFRE","The European Union supported this work through the project CPS.HUB NRW, EFRE No. 0-4000-17.","","14","23","25","0","17","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-4503-5726-5","","","","2018","","","","","","","48","51","","10.1145/3194113.3194122","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3194113.3194122","","","4","Computer Science, Software Engineering","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BL6YE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000454741800009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Suffering from the large overhead of global consensus and security assurance, even leading cryptocurrencies can only handle up to tens of transactions per second, which largely limits their applications in real-world scenarios. Among many proposals to improve cryptocurrency scalability, one of the most promising and mature solutions is the payment channel network (PCN), which offers off-chain settlement of transactions with minimal involvement of expensive blockchain operations. In this paper, we investigate the problem of payment routing in PCN. We suggest crucial design goals in PCN routing, and propose a novel distributed dynamic routing mechanism called CoinExpress. Through extensive simulations, we have shown that our proposed mechanism is able to achieve outstanding payment acceptance ratio with low routing overhead.","[Yu, Ruozhou; Xue, Guoliang; Kilari, Vishnu Teja] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Yang, Dejun] Colorado Sch Mines, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Tang, Jian] Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA","Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Colorado School of Mines; Syracuse University","Yu, RZ (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.","ruozhouy@asu.edu; xue@asu.edu; vkilari@asu.edu; djyang@mines.edu; jtang02@syr.edu","Yu, Ruozhou/J-7141-2016; Yang, Dejun/AAO-4817-2020","Yu, Ruozhou/0000-0003-0905-5158; Yang, Dejun/0000-0002-1811-4423","NSF [1421685, 1525920, 1704092, 1717197, 1717315]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was supported in part by NSF grants 1421685, 1525920, 1704092, 1717197, and 1717315.","","22","16","17","0","5","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-5156-8","","","","2018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BL3YR","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000450116600033","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The first question is - if cryptocurrency a new kind of money. It is difficult to answer this question definitely because till recent time the nature of money remained to be a subject of discussion. Now we have a good founded conception, which represents modern understanding of money. It is based on two principles. The first principle is the desire for wealth which exists in any human being, and in the human society as a social community. The second principle is the equality of exchange as a law of economy. Keeping in mind these two principles, we discover that mankind during the whole its history created and used only two kinds of economic operations, which are two kinds of equal exchange: trade and credit. First common economic operation in history was trade, while credit was rather an occasional one. So, money had emerged first from trade. The trade deal was performed by two independent participants. So, the only guaranty of equality of the exchange was the own value of the commodity which was used as money. This is why trade created commodity money, and the best commodities for this task were gold and silver. Credit created a verbal or a written agreement, which was an equivalent of the value of the loan. Commodity money was inconvenient for capitalism, and capitalism created its own money from the agreement between participants of the credit deal. It was possible because capitalism created close economic relations between people. Credit money is in accordance with the requirements of capitalist economy, it performs all necessary functions, it adapts good the influence of progress, and it is convenient for various needs. Modern capitalist economy doesn't need other kinds of money. Accepting this conception, we treat cryptocurrencies as tokens of various kinds, but not as money. In spite of the word currency in the name, these financial instruments are not currencies but tokens suitable for transfer money and some other needs. The anonymity of the deals with these instruments, the absence of public control and some other qualities of that kind became the reason of strong demand for cryptocurrencies and of the rise of their price, especially the price of bitcoins. Flight of capital, some other illegal deals, as well, as the possibility of rapid enrichment attracted people to operations with bitcoins but the rise and fall of its price exposed the scale of risks of such operations. Nevertheless, the main merit of cryptocurrencies is the blockchain system. This system can be successfully used in various industries where exists a need for fixing big numbers of items or of operations. This reasons demand from government economic policy to be careful and wise. The state has time to wait until the processes in this sphere will become more clear and stable. The same approach must be implemented to government regulation of ICO as a new method of attracting investments for business projects. The fact that many deals of that kind were used just to take off money from people must not became a reason to ban these deals. Blockchain system, cryptocurrencies and ICO create a new civil financial society with some kind of self-regulation. Such processes are typical for contemporary time, but they don't mean introducing a new kind of money. The digital revolution will create its own way of interaction of these instruments with existing credit money, and the new system will inevitably demand some sort of state regulation.","[Portnoy, Mikhail A.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst USA & Canada Studies, 2-3 Khlebnyi Per, Moscow 121069, Russia","Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute for the US & Canadian Studies, Russian Academy of Sciences","Portnoy, MA (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst USA & Canada Studies, 2-3 Khlebnyi Per, Moscow 121069, Russia.","portm@mail.ru","","","","","","","9","0","0","3","58","NAUKA PUBLISHING HOUSE","MOSCOW","PROFSOYUZNAYA UL 90, MOSCOW, 117864, RUSSIA","0131-2227","","","MIROVAYA EKON MEZHD","Mirovaya Ekon.

Yet, parallel ecosystems like cryptocurrencies that substitute products and services of traditional financial institutions emerged. However, literature does not provide a structured overview of the blockchain ecosystem. By analyzing 479 blockchain companies reported in the Crunchbase database, this paper visualizes the current blockchain ecosystem using the e(3)-value method consisting of eleven generic roles. Moreover, we identify three strategic implications where blockchain is fundamentally different from prior approaches: governance, trust, and openness. Scholars can apply the generic ecosystem for future research, while practitioners can use the model to identify possible disruptive actors or potential business opportunities.","[Riasanow, Tobias; Burckhardt, Fiona; Setzke, David Soto; Boehm, Markus; Krcmar, Helmut] Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany","Technical University of Munich","Riasanow, T (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany.","tobias.riasanow@in.tum.de; fiona.burckhardt@tum.de; setzke@in.tum.de; markus.boehm@in.tum.de; krcmar@in.tum.de","","","","","","","41","0","0","1","2","ASSOC INFORMATION SYSTEMS","ATLANTA","P.O.

A new proof-of-work is introduced which seems to be the first number theoretic proof-of-work unrelated to primes: it is based on a new metric associated to the Collatz algorithm whose natural generalization is algorithmically undecidable: the inflation propensity is defined as the cardinality of new maxima in a developing Collatz orbit. It is numerically verified that the distribution of inflation propensity slowly converges to a geometric distribution of parameter 0.714 approximate to (pi-1)/3 as the sample size increases. This pseudo-randomness opens the door to a new class of proofs-of-work based on congruential graphs.","","","","fabian.bocart@gmail.com","","","","","","","24","5","5","1","9","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1911-8066","1911-8074","","J RISK FINANC MANAG","J.

We discuss mechanism design theory to suggest where blockchains may or may not be seen as implementable mechanisms. We further discuss the idea of defining self-identity as an 'elastic asset' using the blockchain in order to generate Ricardian rent from the cryptoeconomy. We suggest how this connection might be exhibited by the Bitcoin blockchain mechanism by discussing the shape of the cryptoeconomy it produces. Finally, we develop an application of the Coase theorem for the cryptoeconomy as a method for analyzing interactions between the traditional economy and the cryptoeconomy.","","","","goorha@sent.com","","","","","","","18","2","2","1","1","BRITISH BLOCKCHAIN ASSOC","LONDON","KEMP HOUSE 152-160 CITY RD, LONDON, EC1V 2NX, ENGLAND","","2516-3957","","J BRIT BLOCKCHAIN AS","J.

However, version 1 was launched in 2017 without an implementation of a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) ordering service. To overcome this limitation, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a BFT ordering service for this system on top of the BFT-SMART state machine replication/consensus library, with optimizations for wide-area deployment.

In this paper, we examine the extent to which anonymity is achieved in the deployed version of Zcash. We investigate all facets of anonymity in Zcash's transactions, ranging from its transparent transactions to the interactions with and within its main privacy feature, a shielded pool that acts as the anonymity set for users wishing to spend coins privately. We conclude that while it is possible to use Zcash in a private way, it is also possible to shrink its anonymity set considerably by developing simple heuristics based on identifiable patterns of usage.","[Kappos, George; Yousaf, Haaroon; Maller, Mary; Meiklejohn, Sarah] UCL, London, England","University of London; University College London","Kappos, G (corresponding author), UCL, London, England.","georgios.kappos.16@ucl.ac.uk; h.yousaf@ucl.ac.uk; mary.maller.15@ucl.ac.uk; s.meiklejohn@ucl.ac.uk","","Yousaf, Haaroon/0000-0001-5098-5811","EPSRC [EP/N028104/1]; EU [740558]; Microsoft Research","EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EU(European Commission); Microsoft Research(Microsoft)","We would like to thank Lustro, the maintainer of the Zchain explorer, for answering specific questions we asked about the service.

Blockchaining is a new technology that was introduced with the creation of Bitcoin in 2008. Blockchaining has mostly been implemented in the field of cryptocurrency but there are many other useful applications of blockchaining. It allows for a decentralized ledger of data that can securely keep a network honest and prevent from possible attacks.

Our study allows us to conclude that cryptocurrency networks present a new paradigm of P2P networks due to the mechanisms they use to achieve high resilience and security.

This poses the problem of concentrating levers of consensus to a select group of agents in the system. At the same time, attempts at higher levels of decentralization poses the problem of limiting scalability of such systems.

"J","Kuznetsov, YV","","","","Kuznetsov, Yury, V","","","Justice Without Law: Legal Status of Cryptocurrency in a Bankruptcy Case","EKONOMICHESKAYA POLITIKA","","","Russian","Article","","","","","","bitcoin; digital financial assets; virtual currency; legal status of cryptocurrency; bankruptcy","","Cryptocurrency is a brand new civil law object and its legal framework is in a formative stage. As of early December 2018, no federal law regulating activities with cryptocurrencies is enacted in Russia. Nevertheless, cryptocurrency issues have already appeared in court cases, in particular in connection with defense of creditors' rights. An emblematic case in this respect is the recent personal bankruptcy trial of Ilia Tsarkov, which was held at the Moscow Arbitrazh Court. The bankruptcy trustee requested to include the bitcoins in possession of the debtor in the bankruptcy estate. The debtor objected to this, his key argument being that legal relations concerning cryptocurrencies (or bitcoins) were not regulated by Russian legislation and even the concept itself was not mentioned in any statute; thus bitcoins could not be legally treated as property. However, the second-instance court agreed with the trustee's arguments and annulled the first-instance court ruling. The main argument was that, if principles of the Russian civil law were applied properly, then bitcoins should be treated as other property. In addition, the use of the first-instance court's arguments opens the door for infringement of property rights of creditors. The first-instance court's ruling is an obvious illustration of dominant textualism in Russian judiciary. The appellate court's decision, on the other hand, demonstrates that said textualism could be overcome by judiciary actions at least in some circumstances such as defense of creditors' rights. The treatment of cryptocurrency as other property by the court is in general agreement with the conception of the Ministry of Finance's draft law On digital financial assets.","[Kuznetsov, Yury, V] Financial Res Inst, Str 2,3,Nastasyinskiy Per, Moscow 127006, Russia; [Kuznetsov, Yury, V] Editorial Board Journal Econ Policy, Str 1,3-5 Gazetny Per, Moscow 125009, Russia","","Kuznetsov, YV (corresponding author), Financial Res Inst, Str 2,3,Nastasyinskiy Per, Moscow 127006, Russia.;Kuznetsov, YV (corresponding author), Editorial Board Journal Econ Policy, Str 1,3-5 Gazetny Per, Moscow 125009, Russia.","yurii-kuz@mail.ru","Kuznetsov, Yury/X-4950-2019","","","","","","9","1","2","1","11","EKONOMICESKAA POLITIKA","MOSCOW","EKONOMICESKAA POLITIKA, MOSCOW, 00000, RUSSIA","1994-5124","2411-2658","","EKONOMICHESKAYA POLI","EKONOMICHESKAYA POLIT.","DEC","2018","13","6","","","","","122","135","","10.18288/1994-5124-2018-6-122-135","http://dx.doi.org/10.18288/1994-5124-2018-6-122-135","","","14","Economics","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Business & Economics","HJ3XJ","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000457106900006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A number of solutions have emerged in recent years that provide transparency in the setting of certificate issuance, and Bitcoin provides an example of how to enforce transparency in a financial setting. In this work we shift to a new setting, the distribution of software package binaries, and present a system for so-called binary transparency. Our solution, Contour, uses proactive methods for providing transparency, privacy, and availability, even in the face of persistent man-in-the-middle attacks. We also demonstrate, via benchmarks and a test deployment for the Debian software repository, that Contour is the only system for binary transparency that satisfies the efficiency and coordination requirements that would make it possible to deploy today.","[Al-Bassam, Mustafa; Meiklejohn, Sarah] UCL, London, England","University of London; University College London","Al-Bassam, M (corresponding author), UCL, London, England.","mustafa.al-bassam.16@ucl.ac.uk; s.meiklejohn@ucl.ac.uk","","","Alan Turing Institute; EPSRC [EP/N028104/1]","Alan Turing Institute; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","Mustafa Al-Bassam is supported by a scholarship from the Alan Turing Institute, and Sarah Meiklejohn is supported by EPSRC grant EP/N028104/1.","","28","6","6","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-00305-0; 978-3-030-00304-3","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","11025","","","","","","93","110","","10.1007/978-3-030-00305-0_8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00305-0_8","","","18","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BN2ZL","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000477970100008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Alternatively, an advanced compiler can identify and avoid possible parallel access conflicts. While manual conflict resolution can theoretically be more precise, it is impractical for real world applications because of the inherent complexities. Here automatic compiler based analysis is preferred which provides conservative conflict avoidance with minimal false positives. This paper introduces a novel compiler technique called Port Call Path analysis that greatly reduces the amount of false positive conflicts resulting in significantly increased simulation speed. Experimental results show that the new analysis reduces the amount of false conflicts by up to 98% and, on a 4-core processor, speeds up the simulation up to 3x for a NoC particle simulator and 3.5x for a bitcoin miner SystemC model.","[Schmidt, Tim; Cheng, Zhongqi; Domer, Rainer] Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Embedded Comp Syst, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","University of California System; University of California Irvine","Schmidt, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Embedded Comp Syst, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.","","Doemer, Rainer/AAD-6677-2020","Doemer, Rainer/0000-0001-9586-4861","Intel Corporation","Intel Corporation(Intel Corporation)","This work has been supported in part by substantial funding from Intel Corporation for the project titled Out-of-Order Parallel Simulation of SystemC Virtual Platforms on Many-Core Architectures.

One of the fields that has potential possibilities to benefit from BlockChain features is telecommunication. BlockChain can be applied in case of management of various networks to reduce some expenses. In this position paper, we apply a BlockChain network with smart contract in the cellular mobile networks. The Blockchain can provide a distributed HSS in a way that the core networks of different operators can use it in a secure manner.

As blockchain technology is still at an early stage, there are little works on applying software architectural methods to the design of blockchain-based applications. In this paper, we summarise eight smart contract design patterns based on existing smart contracts and our experience, and classify them into four categories: Creational Patterns, Structural Patterns, Inter-Behavioral Patterns, and Intra-Behavioral Patterns.

The common denominator among all distributed ledger technologies is their reliance on a distributed, decentralized peer-to-peer network and a set of modular mechanisms such as cryptographic hashes and consensuses mechanisms. However, their implementations vary substantially in terms of the used data structure, fault tolerance and consensus approaches. This divergence affects the nature of each instance of the DLT in terms of cost, security, latency and performance. In this paper, we present a snapshot of four existing implementations of DLTs.

In this paper, we consider deploying edge computing service to support the mobile blockchain. We propose an auction-based edge computing resource allocation mechanism for the edge computing service provider. Since there is competition among miners, the allocative externalities are taken into account in the model. In our auction mechanism, we maximize the social welfare while guaranteeing the truthfulness, individual rationality and computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance of our auction mechanism which shows that the proposed mechanism can efficiently solve the social welfare maximization problem for the edge computing service provider.","[Jiao, Yutao; Wang, Ping; Niyato, Dusit; Xiong, Zehui] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore","Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University","Jiao, YT (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore.","","Xiong, Zehui/B-9792-2019","Xiong, Zehui/0000-0002-4440-941X","","","","","19","37","37","1","9","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1550-3607","","978-1-5386-3180-5","IEEE ICC","","","2018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BO5ZI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000519271303081","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In view of this large scale adoption of blockchain technology, it is of interest to analyze the performance of the underlying mechanisms in peer-to-peer blockchain networks. In this work, we simulate a model for a peer-to-peer blockchain network relying on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, and present an analysis of the (overall, peer-to-peer) cost and throughput of the PoW consensus mechanism. We find compelling empirical evidence that the cost of the PoW consensus is superlinearithmic and subquadratic in the size of the network. Indeed, the number of necessary syncing calls, to maintain throughput scalable with the size, grow in that manner.","[Asgaonkar, Aditya; Palande, Pranav; Joshi, Ramprasad S.] BITS, Pilani, Goa, India","Birla Institute of Technology & Science Pilani (BITS Pilani)","Asgaonkar, A (corresponding author), BITS, Pilani, Goa, India.","f20150043@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in; f20150081@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in; rsj@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in","","Joshi, Ramprasad S/0000-0002-1994-1906","","","","","9","2","2","0","2","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-6341-9","","","","2018","","","","","","","314","317","","10.1145/3152494.3167978","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3152494.3167978","","","4","Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS2HX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000701520600036","View Full Record in Web of Science"

By fate or by good fortune, carbon markets and cryptocurrencies face common problems: a need to find consensus on data, and a need to trade value between distrustful strangers. Could the blockchain ledger enable a consensus on carbon budgets, and deliver value for carbon mitigation services? Could blockchain technologies help to resolve the climate crisis ?To answer these questions, we need to examine the opportunities for decentralized ledgers in carbon and energy markets. Here we show that the blockchain offers a unique opportunity to improve accountability in carbon markets and to develop renewable energy micro-grids, but for the blockchain to reach its full potential-to he the game changer-it should be combined with macro-economic policies and macro-prudential regulatory frameworks that can finance a multi-trillion-dollar transition.","[Chen, Delton B.] Ctr Regenerat Community Solut, Basking Ridge, NJ 07920 USA","","Chen, DB (corresponding author), Ctr Regenerat Community Solut, Basking Ridge, NJ 07920 USA.","deltonchen@crcsolutions.org","","","","","","","23","13","13","12","16","BRITISH BLOCKCHAIN ASSOC","LONDON","KEMP HOUSE 152-160 CITY RD, LONDON, EC1V 2NX, ENGLAND","","2516-3957","","J BRIT BLOCKCHAIN AS","J.

Ethereum, as a well-known public blockchain, is favored by large companies and organizations for its excellent account model and Turing-complete smart contracts, and is widely used to develop consortium-blockchain. However, the performance and storage of executing contract gradually degrade as the transaction volume increases. Meanwhile, compared with public blockchains, companies need a more accurate estimation of prospective performance and storage based on business scale for decisions making or early warnings. In this paper, a prediction model derived from the core structure of Ethereum's World State is proposed. The proposed model predicts the performance and storage of executing contract based on transaction volume. The comparison between the experimental and predicted data reveals that this model can perform a relative accurate prediction of the prospective system's performance and storage.","[Zhang, Huijuan; Jin, Chengxin; Cui, Hejie] Tongji Univ, 1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Tongji University","Zhang, HJ; Jin, CX; Cui, HJ (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, 1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China.","mszhj@tongji.edu.cn; jinchengxin@outlook.com; cuihejie331771@gmail.com","","Cui, Hejie/0000-0001-6388-2619","","","","","14","6","6","0","1","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-319-94478-4; 978-3-319-94477-7","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","10974","","","","","","63","74","","10.1007/978-3-319-94478-4_5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-94478-4_5","","","12","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BQ7CF","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000614362600005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Multiple versions of Bitcoin and Curl were examined in our study to notice a trend over time. In our study, a static analysis is applied to each system, and the number of calls to unsafe functions and their alternatives is recorded and tallied. Additionally, we applied the analysis with both the cloud based web application and the desktop based solutions. The results of our study show that vulnerable functions such as, strcmp, sscanf, and memcpy are the most common unsafe functions that are used in the software systems. This information is important because it can allow those who educate in the fields of software engineering and computer science to better prepare their students to implement a coding practice that is secure and sustainable. As well as providing information for educators, this also gives engineers in the field a more effective and efficient way of refactoring their code to clean their systems from vulnerabilities by focusing on the unsafe code that is the most prevalent to their system. The historical data for the two systems, is presented over a five version period. The data shows that for both systems the number of unsafe calls are increasing from version to version. This is an alarming trend that both contradicts and is quite surprising, because of the growing use of Bitcoin and Curl. Another component of this study is the difference in performance between the cloud based web application analysis and the desktop based analysis. The hopes of the cloud based web application analysis tool is to allow for greater accessibility and the ability to track a software system from version to version. Currently, the web application allows a user to login and upload an XML version of their source code using srcML and the results of the analysis, presented as graphs, are stored in their account.","[Crifasi, Elliott; Pike, Sean; Stuedemann, Zechariah] Univ Wisconsin Parkside, Comp Sci Dept, Kenosha, WI 53144 USA; [Alnaeli, Saleh M.; Altahat, Zaid] Univ Wisconsin Coll, Comp Sci Dept, Madison, WI USA","University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Parkside; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison","Crifasi, E (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Parkside, Comp Sci Dept, Kenosha, WI 53144 USA.","crifa001@rangers.uwp.edu; pike003@rangers.uwp.edu; stuede001@rangers.uwp.edu; saleh.alnaeli@uwc.edu; altahat@uwc.edu","","","University of Wisconsin Parkside (UWP); university Wisconsin -Fox Valley; CSEPA department at UW-Colleges","University of Wisconsin Parkside (UWP); university Wisconsin -Fox Valley; CSEPA department at UW-Colleges","This work was partially funded by the University of Wisconsin Parkside (UWP), the university Wisconsin -Fox Valley, and CSEPA department at UW-Colleges.","","5","3","3","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2154-0357","","978-1-5386-5398-2","INT CONF ELECTRO INF","","","2018","","","","","","","651","654","","","","","","4","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BQ9YL","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000627374800136","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, despite the potential demonstrated by projects such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger Fabric, the disk space typically required to host a copy of a ledger may be prohibitively large for many categories of devices. In this paper, we introduce an approach for reducing ledger size in blockchain systems, based on arbitrary pruning predicate functions, allowing each network participant to independently select and remove any already applied transactions. We also show that if only pruning certain ledger transactions, the ability to derive an unmodified state data structure from the remaining transactions is maintained. The approach is validated through a supply chain use case utilizing a modified version of Hyperledger Fabric, in which ledger size is reduced by about 84.49% via selective transaction pruning.","[Palm, Emanuel; Schelen, Olov; Bodin, Ulf] Lulea Univ Technol, Lulea, Sweden","Lulea University of Technology","Palm, E (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Lulea, Sweden.","emanuel.palm@ltu.se; olov.schelen@ltu.se; ulf.bodin@ltu.se","Palm, Emanuel K./ABA-2982-2020","Palm, Emanuel K./0000-0002-9865-8753","EU ARTEMIS JU [737459]","EU ARTEMIS JU","Dr. Johan Kristiansson, formerly at Ericsson Research in Lulea, provided indispensable guidance.

Therefore, ransomware has become a lucrative business that has gained increasing popularity among attackers. Unlike traditional malware, even after removal, ransomware's effect is irreversible and difficult to mitigate without the help of its creator. In addition to the downtime costs and the money that individuals and business entities could pay as a ransom, those victims could incur other damage such as loss of data, reputation, and life. To date, several studies have been conducted to address this unique, challenging threat and have tried to provide detection and prevention solutions. However, there is a lack of survey articles that explore the research endeavors in ransomware and highlight the challenges and issues faced by existing solutions. This survey fills the gap and provides a holistic state-of-the-art review of the research on ransomware and its detection and prevention techniques. The survey puts forward a novel ransomware taxonomy, from several perspectives. It then elaborates on the factors that lead to a successful ransomware attacks before discussing in detail the research into counteracting ransomware, including analysis, prevention, detection and prediction solutions. The survey concludes with a brief discussion on the open issues and potential research directions in the near future. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Annotated files are continuously monitored and metadata about changes including file hashes are stored tamper-proof on the blockchain. Based on this, Endolith can prove that a file stored a long time ago has not been changed without authorization or, if it did, track when it has changed, by whom. Endolith implementation is based on Ethereum and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

As such, while a blockchain-based cryptocurrency can't be considered as legal tender or electronic money, it can be exchanged on a contractual basis as it happens with every other kind of good. As per the alleged crime-supporting role of cryptocurrencies by way of the anonymity of the blockchain transactions, this article demonstrates that the anonymity granted herein is not absolute. Therefore it is not correct to claim that this technology has been built, by design, to foster illegal behaviour. This is an important finding because, in the opposite case, there would have been room to affirm the impossibility to use a cryptocurrency as part of an agreement because of its intrinsic illegal nature.","[Monti, Andrea] Univ G dAnnunzio, Diritto Ordine & Sicurezza Pubbl, Via Paolini 96, I-65124 Pescara, Italy","G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara","Monti, A (corresponding author), Univ G dAnnunzio, Diritto Ordine & Sicurezza Pubbl, Via Paolini 96, I-65124 Pescara, Italy.","amonti@unich.it","ALEXOPOULOU, EFTHYMIA/AAG-5308-2020","","","","","","15","0","0","4","14","SOC ED IL MULINO","BOLOGNA","STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY","1720-2396","","","RAGION PRAT","Ragion Prat.","DEC","2018","50","2","","","","","361","377","","10.1415/91544","http://dx.doi.org/10.1415/91544","","","17","Philosophy","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Philosophy","HD3RQ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000452436900005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

At first it appeared the perfect crime where whole organizations had lost access to their vital information and the only way out was to pay the attackers in Bitcoin for the key to the lock. However, the Ransomware business model requires the formation of a trust relationship between the attacker and the victim; and the potential for the formation and maintenance of a trust relationship became rapidly eroded by identifiable points of failure. In order to better understand the phenomena we spent 12 months of emersion in an exploratory study observing the business processes and technologies associated with Ransomware.

In addition, to cope with the area overhead problem, an activation-oriented monitoring paths selection method is proposed to decrease the insertion rate. Implemented on a 45-nm CMOS Bitcoin miner chip working across 0.6 V-1.1 V, it increases the throughput by 190.8%, 83.3%, 67.9%, and 25.4% at 0.6 V, 0.72 V, 0.9 V, and 1.1 V, respectively, for a typical die at 25 degrees C, compared to baseline frequencies.

Beyond cryptocurrencies, it is believed that blockchain can also be used to protect other properties such as reputation. Most of the existing studies of enhancing reputation systems using blockchains are built on top of the bitcoin-like blockchains, so they are inherently constrained by the low-efficiency and high-consumption of the underlying blockchain. To fill this gap, we present a reputation-based consensus protocol called Proof of Reputation (PoR), which guarantees the reliability and integrity of transaction outcomes in an efficient way. In PoR, we let reputation serves as the incentive for both good behavior and block publication instead of digital coins, therefore no miners are needed. We also implement a prototype and our scalability experiments show that our protocol can scale to over a thousand participants in a peer-to-peer network with throughput of hundreds of transactions per second.","[Gai, Fangyu; Wang, Baosheng; Deng, Wenping; Peng, Wei] Natl Univ Def Technol, Sch Comp, Changsha, Peoples R China","National University of Defense Technology - China","Deng, WP (corresponding author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Sch Comp, Changsha, Peoples R China.","wpdeng@nudt.edu.cn","","","","","","","26","41","43","3","11","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-319-91458-9; 978-3-319-91457-2","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","10828","","II","","","","666","681","","10.1007/978-3-319-91458-9_41","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-91458-9_41","","","16","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP3HL","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000546514000041","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A wide variety of open source blockchains emerge recent years, which are different in architecture design or protocol parameters. When a developer wants to compare runtime performance of different blockchains, he could conduct a simulation with event simulator, or run application on physical machines. Either way will result in problems of unconvincing or costly. Container, a lightweight virtualization technique, is suitable for solving this dilemma. Tens of containers could run simultaneously in a single-core CPU computer, with each container having a running blockchain client. A simulated blockchain network with hundreds of nodes could be easily established in this way. In this paper, we firstly overview blockchain architecture choices which will significantly affect performance. Then we introduce our framework on testing blockchains using containerization. Authenticity and high cost of P2P application testing would be balanced in this framework. Finally, we implement our framework to run a demo testing how bitcoin's network parameters will affect system reliability.","[Chen, Chen; Qi, Zhuyun; Liu, Yirui; Lei, Kai] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Cloud Comp Technol & Applicat, Sch Elect & Comp Engn SECE, Inst Big Data Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China","Peking University","Lei, K (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Cloud Comp Technol & Applicat, Sch Elect & Comp Engn SECE, Inst Big Data Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.","tocc@sz.pku.edu.cn; qizy@pkusz.edu.cn; 993518823@qq.com; leik@pkusz.edu.cn","","","Shenzhen Key Fundamental Research Projects [JCYJ20170412151008290, JCYJ20170306091556329, JCYJ20170412150946024]","Shenzhen Key Fundamental Research Projects","This work has been financially supported by Shenzhen Key Fundamental Research Projects (Grant No. JCYJ20170412151008290, JCYJ20170306091556329 and JCYJ20170412150946024).","","5","5","5","0","3","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-319-73830-7; 978-3-319-73829-1","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","10699","","","","","","289","299","","10.1007/978-3-319-73830-7_29","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-73830-7_29","","","11","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BP4TO","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000554410000029","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In addition, the development of blockchain is also growing rapidly since it was first popularized in Bitcoin. Security issues on this IoT can be solved using blockchain. One way that can be done is to make secure communication between IoT devices. In this study, an IoT system will be created without and using blockchain which will then be compared between the two. The communication protocol used in IoT systems without blockchain is MQTT. Meanwhile, the blockchain platform used is Ethereum along with a smart contract. Both of these IoT systems will be analyzed for their security level by simulating attacks and observing their security aspects. The test results show that the IoT system based on blockchain technology has a higher level of security than the IoT system without blockchain technology.","[Fakhri, Dinan; Mutijarsa, Kusprasapta] Inst Teknol Bandung, Sch Elect Engn & Informat, Dept Elect Engn, Bandung, Indonesia","Institute Technology of Bandung","Fakhri, D (corresponding author), Inst Teknol Bandung, Sch Elect Engn & Informat, Dept Elect Engn, Bandung, Indonesia.","dinanfakhri@students.itb.ac.id; soni@stei.itb.ac.id","Sánchez-Gómez, Nicolás/K-3758-2014","","","","","","22","34","34","4","7","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-6670-8","","","","2018","","","","","","","134","139","","","","","","6","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BL9TM","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000458316600029","View Full Record in Web of Science"

One particular area based on the distributed ledger technology that has grabbed the attention of many technologist and financial marketers is Smart Contracts. Based on a cryptocurrency framework known as Ethereum, these smart contracts can be used for different applications such as Option Pricing, Currency Exchange, Revenue Management System, Crowd-funding and Peer-to-Peer networking.

Digital payments can be made on front-end IoT devices, while a back-end blockchain serves as a distributed ledger to ensure the validity of payments across the system. Nevertheless, fast payments are usually on demand in such a scenario, but an open problem still remains on how to protect blockchain-based systems from double-spending attacks in the context of fast payment. Off-chain techniques, such as Lightning Network and Raiden Network, act as countermeasures to this problem, but they all suffer from the hidden transactions problem. To combat this problem, we propose FastPay, a solution for achieving secure fast payments in blockchain-backed edge-IoT systems.

We differentiate between permissionless (e.g., Bitcoin/Ethereum) and permissioned (e.g. Hyperledger/Corda) blockchains and contrast their properties to those of a centrally managed database. We provide a structured methodology to determine the appropriate technical solution to solve a particular application problem. Given our methodology, we analyze in depth three use cases - Supply Chain Management, Interbank and International Payments, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and conclude the article with an outlook for further opportunities.","[Wust, Karl] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Gervais, Arthur] Imperial Coll London, Dept Comp, London, England","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Imperial College London","Wust, K (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.","karl.wuest@inf.ethz.ch; a.gervais@imperial.ac.uk","Wüst, Karl/ABH-1743-2020","","","","","","25","305","309","6","61","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-7204-4","","","","2018","","","","","","","45","54","","10.1109/CVCBT.2018.00011","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CVCBT.2018.00011","","","10","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BM6IA","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000466595100006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

These substances are advertised and distributed as an alternative to traditional drugs on the Internet, making identification of new substances and enforcement difficult. For this article, we downloaded and analysed 28 Russian-language online drug marketplaces which distribute traditional and novel psychoactive substances. All marketplaces used a noncontact drug dealing method where the seller and the buyer communicate through the Internet to arrange for payment and delivery of drugs without meeting face-to-face. Geographic information, price, amount, substance type and payment method data were extracted. Findings indicate such marketplaces are able to operate due to the ability of their clients to pay anonymously with the virtual currencies - Qiwi and Bitcoin.","[Mikhaylov, Alexander; Frank, Richard] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Criminol, Burnaby, BC, Canada","Simon Fraser University","Mikhaylov, A (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Criminol, Burnaby, BC, Canada.","amikhayl@sfu.ca","Михайлов, Александр/O-6778-2019","","","","","","59","2","2","2","6","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1744-0572","1744-0580","","GLOB CRIME","Glob.

A ransomware attack hit Wildcat Hospital as the workday began. Malware infected the hospital's computers and demanded one bitcoin, a virtual currency that affords anonymity, as ransom to restore functionality of the information systems. The chief executive officer and the chief information officer led the organizational response to the attack. We include links to two videos, a demo of a Locky ransomware attack in action, and a National Broadcasting Company (NBC) TV network news report about a similar ransomware incident at another hospital (Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in California) to engage students.","[Sipior, Janice C.; Bierstaker, James] Villanova Univ, Dept Accountancy & Informat Syst, Villanova, PA 19085 USA; [Borchardt, Paul] IronGate Cyber Risk LLC, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Borchardt, Paul] Villanova Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Villanova, PA 19085 USA; [Ward, Burke T.] Villanova Univ, Dept Mkt & Business Law, Villanova, PA 19085 USA","Villanova University; Villanova University; Villanova University","Sipior, JC (corresponding author), Villanova Univ, Dept Accountancy & Informat Syst, Villanova, PA 19085 USA.","janice.sipior@villanova.edu","","","","","","","16","3","3","1","3","ASSOC INFORMATION SYSTEMS","ATLANTA","GEORGIA STATE UNIV, 35 BROAD STREET, STE 916-917, ATLANTA, GA 30303 USA","1529-3181","","","COMMUN ASSOC INF SYS","Commun.

These techniques allow a party to prove to another party that a given statement is true without revealing any additional information. In a Bitcoin-like system, this allows a payer to prove validity of a payment without disclosing the payment's details. Unfortunately, the existing systems for generating such proofs are very expensive, especially in terms of memory overhead. Worse yet, these systems are monolithic, so they are limited by the memory resources of a single machine. This severely limits their practical applicability. We describe DIZK, a system that distributes the generation of a zero knowledge proof across machines in a compute cluster. Using a set of new techniques, we show that DIZK scales to computations of up to billions of logical gates (100x larger than prior art) at a cost of 10 mu s per gate (100x faster than prior art). We then use DIZK to study various security applications.","[Wu, Howard; Zheng, Wenting; Chiesa, Alessandro; Popa, Raluca Ada; Stoica, Ion] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","University of California System; University of California Berkeley","Wu, H (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.","","","","Intel/NSF CPS-Security grants [1505773, 20153754]; UC Berkeley Center","Intel/NSF CPS-Security grants; UC Berkeley Center","The authors are grateful to Jiahao Wang for participating in early stages of this work.

Student credit systems and the historical information data chain need urgent establishment and maintenance. The paper makes use of the transparency and non-tampering features of the blockchain system to implement an Education-Industry cooperative system based on the blockchain Hyperledger framework. Using the Certificate Authority service and transactions in the Hyperledger framework, the system simulates the roles of universities and companies in the system, and enables universities and enterprises to share information transparently, which achieves information symmetry among student skill and knowledge information, demands of enterprise recruitment, and current market trends. This offers a significant attempt on the application of blockchain technology to Education-Industry cooperation as a pilot development for technology deployment.","[Liu, Qin; Guan, Qingchen; Yang, Xiaowen; Zhu, Hongming; Yin, Shaohan] Tongji Univ, Sch Software Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Green, Gill] Univ Bolton, Ctr Islamic Finance, Bolton, England","Tongji University; University of Bolton","Yang, XW (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Sch Software Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.","qin.liu@tongji.edu.cn; guanqingchen@tongji.edu.cn; fionyang@tongji.edu.cn; zhu_hongming@tongji.edu.cn; G.Green@bolton.ac.uk; yinshaohan@tongji.edu.cn","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFB1000805]; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality [17511107303, 17511110202]; Shanghai Sailing Program [17YF1420500]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(Science & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM)); Shanghai Sailing Program","The paper is sponsored by The National Key Research and Development Program of China(2016YFB1000805), Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (17511107303,17511110202), The Shanghai Sailing Program (17YF1420500).","","8","18","18","0","17","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-4870-4","","","","2018","","","","","","","207","211","","","","","","5","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BL9QK","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000458100900033","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this work, we estimate the potential profitability of mining and speculating 18 altcoins using real-world blockchain and trade data. Using opportunity cost as a metric, we estimate the mining cost for an altcoin with respect to a more popular but stable coin. For every dollar invested in mining or buying a coin, we compute the potential returns under various conditions, such as time of market entry and hold positions. While some coins offer the potential for spectacular returns, many follow a simple bubble-and-crash scenario, which highlights the extreme risks and potential gains- in altcoin markets.","[Huang, Danny Yuxing] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Levchenko, Kirill; Snoeren, Alex C.] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA","Princeton University; University of California System; University of California San Diego","Huang, DY (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.","dhuang@cs.ucsd.edu","","","","","","","7","1","1","0","2","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-662-58387-6; 978-3-662-58386-9","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","10957","","","","","","409","419","","10.1007/978-3-662-58387-6_22","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-58387-6_22","","","11","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP1RW","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000540656400022","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A promising scaling solution, exemplified by the Lightning Network, uses a network of bidirectional payment channels that allows fast transactions between two parties. However, routing payments on these networks efficiently is non-trivial, since payments require finding paths with sufficient funds, and channels can become unidirectional over time blocking further transactions through them. Today's payment channel networks exacerbate these problems by attempting to deliver all payments atomically. We present the Spider network, a new packet-switched architecture for payment channel networks that addresses these challenges. Spider splits payments into transaction units and transmits them over a period of time across different paths. Spider uses congestion control, in-network scheduling, and imbalance-aware routing to optimize delivery of payments. Our results show that Spider improves the number and volume of successful payments on the network by 10-75% and 10-35% respectively compared to practical state-of-the-art approaches.","[Sivaraman, Vibhaalakshmi; Venkatakrishnan, Shaileshh Bojja; Alizadeh, Mohammad] MIT, CSAIL, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Fanti, Giulia] CMU, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Viswanath, Pramod] UIUC, Champaign, IL USA","Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Carnegie Mellon University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","Sivaraman, V (corresponding author), MIT, CSAIL, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.","spider.network@mit.edu","","","Distributed Technologies Research Foundation; Cisco Research Center; National Science Foundation [CNS-1718270, CNS-1563826, CNS-1617702]; Army Research Office [W911NF1810332]","Distributed Technologies Research Foundation; Cisco Research Center; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Army Research Office","We thank Andrew Miller and Thaddeus Dryja for their feedback, and the Distributed Technologies Research Foundation, the Cisco Research Center, the National Science Foundation grants CNS-1718270, CNS-1563826 and CNS-1617702, and the Army Research Office under grant W911NF1810332 for their support.","","26","23","23","0","3","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-6120-0","","","","2018","","","","","","","29","35","","10.1145/3286062.3286067","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3286062.3286067","","","7","Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO1CU","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000494948500005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We first formalize a PoW-based decentralized secure network model in order to present a quantitative analysis. Next, to resolve the risk of double spending, we propose the personalized difficulty adjustment (PDA) mechanism which modifies the difficulty of each participant such that those who win more blocks in the past few rounds have a smaller probability to win in the next round. To analyze the performance of the PDA mechanism, we observe that the system can be modeled by a high-order Markov chain.

Managed cryptocurrencies can be implemented using private blockchains but are fundamentally different as the owners have complete control to do arbitrary activity without transparency (since they control the mining). In this work we explore a hybrid approach where a managed cryptocurrency is maintained through distributed consensus based methods. The currency administrator can perform ongoing management functions while the consensus methods enforce the rules of the cryptocurrency and provide transparency for all management actions. This enables the introduction of money management features common in fiat currencies but where the managing entity cannot perform arbitrary actions and transparency is enforced. We thus eliminate the need for users to trust the currency administrator but also to enable the administrator to manage the cryptocurrency. We demonstrate how to implement our approach through modest modifications to the implicit Bitcoin specification, however, our approach can be applied to most any blockchain based cryptocurrency using a variety of consensus methods.","[Mell, Peter] NIST, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA","National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) - USA","Mell, P (corresponding author), NIST, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA.","peter.mell@nist.gov","","","","","","","21","1","1","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2324-9013","","978-1-5386-4387-7","IEEE TRUST BIG","","","2018","","","","","","","1287","1296","","10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00177","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00177","","","10","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO1DM","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000495072100168","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We find that the cross correlation matrix exhibits non-trivial hierarchical structures and groupings of cryptocurrency pairs, which are not present in the partial cross correlations. In sharp contrast to the predictions for other financial markets, we discover that most of the eigenvalues in the spectrum of the cross correlation matrix do not agree with the universal predictions of random matrix theory, but the few of the largest eigenvalues deviate as expected. The minimum spanning tree of cryptocurrency cross correlations reveals distinct community structures that are surprisingly stable.

Because current cryptocurrencies require that all transactions are processed and stored on a distributed ledger -the so-called blockchain -transaction throughput is inherently limited. An important proposal to significantly improve scalability are off-chain protocols, where the massive amount of transactions is executed without requiring the costly interaction with the blockchain. Examples of off-chain protocols include payment channels and networks, which are currently deployed by popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. A further extension of payment networks envisioned for cryptocurrencies are so-called state channel networks. In contrast to payment networks that only support off-chain payments between users, state channel networks allow execution of arbitrary complex smart contracts. The main contribution of this work is to give the first full specification for general state channel networks. Moreover, we provide formal security definitions and prove the security of our construction against powerful adversaries. An additional benefit of our construction is the use of channel virtualization, which further reduces latency and costs in complex channel networks.","[Dziembowski, Stefan] Univ Warsaw, Inst Informat, Warsaw, Poland; [Faust, Sebastian; Hostakova, Kristina] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Dept Comp Sci, Darmstadt, Germany","University of Warsaw; Technical University of Darmstadt","Dziembowski, S (corresponding author), Univ Warsaw, Inst Informat, Warsaw, Poland.","stefan.dziembowski@crypto.edu.pl; sebastian.faust@cs.tu-darmstadt.de; kristina.hostakova@crisp-da.de","","Dziembowski, Stefan/0000-0002-6914-6425","Polish National Science Centre [2014/13/B/ST6/03540]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [CRC 1119]; Emmy Noether Program [FA 1320/1-1]","Polish National Science Centre; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Emmy Noether Program(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This work has been supported by the Polish National Science Centre grant 2014/13/B/ST6/03540 and by the German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of project S7 within the CRC 1119 CROSSING and by the Emmy Noether Program FA 1320/1-1.","","33","61","61","0","5","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-5693-0","","","","2018","","","","","","","949","966","","10.1145/3243734.3243856","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3243734.3243856","","","18","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BM2QN","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000461315900061","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We generalize this notion of entropic centrality to non- atomic flows, and furthermore show that the case of a non- atomic flow splitting with equal probability across different subsets of edges results in the same entropic centrality as that of the atomic flow. This gives a new and more generalized interpretation to the original entropic centrality notion.

These permissionless block chains are showing the potential to be disruptive to the financial services industry. Their broader adoption is likely to be limited by the maximum block size, the cost of the Proof of Work consensus mechanism, and the increasing size of any given chain overwhelming most of the participating nodes. These factors have led to many cryptocurrency blockchains to become centralized in the nodes with enough computing power and storage to be a dominant miner and validator. Permissioned chains operate in trusted environments and can, therefore, avoid the computationally expensive consensus mechanisms. Permissioned chains are still susceptible to asset storage demands and non-standard user interfaces that will impede their adoption. This paper describes an approach to addressing these limitations: permissioned blockchain that uses off-chain storage of the data assets and this is accessed through a standard browser and mobile app. The implementation in the Hyperledger framework is described as is an example use of patient-centered health data management.","[Rouhani, Sara; Deters, Ralph] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Comp Sci, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Butterworth, Luke; Simmons, Adam D.; Humphery, Darryl G.] Trioova, Edmonton, AB, Canada","University of Saskatchewan","Rouhani, S (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Comp Sci, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.","sara.rouhani@usask.ca; luke@trioova.ca; adam@trioova.ca; darryl@trioova.ca; deters@cs.usask.ca","Deters, Ralph/AAD-3146-2022","","Mitacs Accelerate program; Alberta Innovates","Mitacs Accelerate program; Alberta Innovates","Development of MediChain (TM) and Trioova (TM) was supported in part by the Mitacs Accelerate program and Alberta Innovates","","12","20","20","1","9","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-7975-3","","","","2018","","","","","","","1533","1538","","10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00258","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00258","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BN4AE","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000481634500223","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This enables a practical P2P electronic money system with Byzantine fault tolerance and stability with all participating nodes having the same transaction ledger and using a distributed consensus algorithm called Proof of Work (PoW) that performs calculation work called mining. Many studies have proposed methods of enhancing scalability in terms of transaction processing of blockchain, however few studies have proposed them in term of network load in a P2P network architecture. To solve these problems, we propose a method in which all nodes are separated into mining nodes in a pure P2P network and blockchain data having nodes in a distributed hash table (DHT) network. Kademlia is incorporated as DHT network for processing responsible blocks' data for each node cluster and broadcasting efficiently. The results of a broadcast simulation show that our method improved the redundancy rate and average number of messages in the networks.","[Kaneko, Yudai] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Syst Design, 6-6 Asahigaoka, Hino, Tokyo 1910065, Japan; [Asaka, Takuya] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Fac Syst Design, 6-6 Asahigaoka, Hino, Tokyo 1910065, Japan","Tokyo Metropolitan University; Tokyo Metropolitan University","Kaneko, Y (corresponding author), Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Syst Design, 6-6 Asahigaoka, Hino, Tokyo 1910065, Japan.","kaneko-yudai@ed.tmu.ac.jp; asaka@tmu.ac.jp","","","","","","","14","3","4","2","5","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-9184-7","","","","2018","","","","","","","71","74","","10.1109/CANDARW.2018.00022","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CANDARW.2018.00022","","","4","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BM7MJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000468090300014","View Full Record in Web of Science"

For having a reliable blockchain and double-spending prevention, we need a decentralized consensus and agreement on a blockchain. Bitcoin uses proof-of-work (PoW). It is a cryptographic puzzle that is difficult to solve but easy to verify. However, because of significant latency of proof-of-work for transactions confirmation, this consensus mechanism is vulnerable against double-spending. On the other hand, PoW consumes a significant amount of energy that by growing the network, it becomes a major problematic of this consensus mechanism. In this paper, we introduce an alternative to PoW, because of all its major problems and security issues that may lead to collapsing decentralization of the blockchain, while a full decentralized system is the main purpose of using blockchain technology. The approach we introduce is based on a distributed voting process and called RDV: Register, Deposit, Vote. Since in RDV algorithm, there is no mining process, so it is appropriate for low-level energy devices and Internet of Things (IoT).","[Solat, Siamak] Engie Lab, Paris, France","","Solat, S (corresponding author), Engie Lab, Paris, France.","siamak.solat@external.engie.com","","","","","","","13","6","6","1","6","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-6050-0","","","","2018","","","","","","","25","32","","10.1145/3282278.3282283","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3282278.3282283","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BN4IG","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000481908000005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Although blockchain has been widely adopted in many applications (e.g., finance, healthcare, and logistics), its application in mobile services is still limited. This is due to the fact that blockchain users need to solve preset proof-of-work puzzles to add new data (i.e., a block) to the blockchain. Solving the proof of work, however, consumes substantial resources in terms of CPU time and energy, which is not suitable for resource-limited mobile devices. To facilitate blockchain applications in future mobile Internet of Things systems, multiple access mobile edge computing appears to be an auspicious solution to solve the proof-of-work puzzles for mobile users. We first introduce a novel concept of edge computing for mobile blockchain. Then we introduce an economic approach for edge computing resource management.

Little attention has been paid to the underlying peer-to-peer (P2P) networks that are responsible for information propagation and that enable blockchain consensus. In this work, we develop NodeFinder to measure this previously opaque network at scale and illuminate the properties of its nodes. We analyze the Ethereum network from two vantage points: a three-month long view of nodes on the P2P network, and a single day snapshot of the Ethereum Mainnet peers. We uncover a noisy DEVp2p ecosystem in which fewer than half of all nodes contribute to the Ethereum Mainnet. Through a comparison with other previously studied P2P networks including BitTorrent, Gnutella, and Bitcoin, we find that Ethereum differs in both network size and geographical distribution.","[Kim, Seoung Kyun; Ma, Zane; Murali, Siddharth; Mason, Joshua; Miller, Andrew; Bailey, Michael] Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA","University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","Kim, SK (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.","skim104@illinois.edu; zanema2@illinois.edu; smurali2@illinois.edu; joshm@illinois.edu; soc1024@illinois.edu; mdbailey@illinois.edu","","","National Science Foundation [CNS 1518741]; Department of Homeland Security [HSHQDC-17-J-00170]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Department of Homeland Security(United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS))","This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under contract CNS 1518741, by the Department of Homeland Security under contract HSHQDC-17-J-00170, and by a gift from Google.

The hype around cryptocurrency and the valuation of innovative projects drove the market cap of cryptocurrencies to over a trillion dollars at one point in 2017. These high valued technologies are now enabling something new: globally scaled and decentralized business models. Despite their valuation and the hype, these new business ecosystems are frail. This is not only because the underlying technology is rapidly evolving, but also because competitive markets see a profit opportunity in exponential cryptocurrency returns.

The essential properties are the capabilities in doing verification and maintaining data integrity which would be hardly guaranteed in other systems. As millions of packages are daily sent, information related to those packages must be protected since they are prone to attacks such as phishing. In addition, current package delivery systems are mostly implemented on a centralized platform which would be vulnerable to different kind of attacks. In this paper, we propose a package delivery system based on the blockchain technology which would help enhance the security with data integrity and the verification of both users and data. We evaluate the performance of our system using two operations: insertions and reads/writes under high workload. We found that our system performance for both insertions and reads/writes is highly sensitive to the number of chains rather than the number of transactions per chain. But, the time spent for reads/writes is much higher than the time spent for insertions.","[Ngamsuriyaroj, Sudsanguan; Likittheerameth, Thammarith; Kahutson, Amorntape; Pathummasut, Thunyaporn] Mahidol Univ, Fac ICT, 999 Phutthamonthon 4 Rd, Salaya, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand","Mahidol University","Ngamsuriyaroj, S (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ, Fac ICT, 999 Phutthamonthon 4 Rd, Salaya, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.","sudsanguan.nga@mahidol.ac.th; thammarith.lik@gmail.com; amornthep.kah@gmail.com; thunyaporn.pat@student.mahidol.ac.th","","","","","","","15","4","4","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-7805-3","","","","2018","","","","","","","77","82","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BO6EJ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000519764300015","View Full Record in Web of Science"

One of these concerns food-chain management, where it is said to have the potential to revolutionise it. This paper looks at this case from an institutional economic perspective. For this, it first clarifies how a straight application of this technology matches basic microeconomic thinking, as restricted to private goods and prices, and thus also the market optimism associated with it. The paper then analyses the role of institutions in the food system as it has so far been organised and how this institutional setting might be changed in order to incorporate this new technology while safeguarding the objective of an overall economic optimum. In order to sketch out some ways in which these conceptual considerations might actually be put to the test, a cursory introduction is given to some options relating to the situation in Romania.

"J","Moerel, L","","","","Moerel, Lokke","","","Blockchain & Data Protection ... and Why They Are Not on a Collision Course","EUROPEAN REVIEW OF PRIVATE LAW","","","English","Article","","","","","","","","Recent publications on the data protection aspects of blockchain technology focus on the characteristics of the initial public (Bitcoin) blockchain, and do so in a generalized manner. The authors then conclude that the characteristics of a public blockchain are profoundly incompatible at a conceptual level with the principles of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR requires identification of a central 'controller' who is responsible for compliance with the GDPR, while a public blockchain decentralizes the storage and processing of personal data, as a result whereof there is no such central point of control. For lack of a better alternative, the authors conclude that all 'nodes' involved in operating a blockchain qualify as a controller under the GDPR, raising enforcement and jurisdictional issues that make it impossible for individuals to enforce their rights. The transparency and immutability of a public blockchain would further not sit well with principles of data confidentiality, data minimization, data accuracy and the rights of individuals to correction and deletion of their data. I disagree with the analysis of these authors for a host of different reasons, the main one being that the authors focus on the shortcomings of the initial public (Bitcoin) blockchain when already many new types of permissioned private and consortium blockchain have been developed that significantly diverge from the original, permissionless public blockchain. In fact, these types of permissioned blockchain have been developed in response to the shortcomings of public blockchain. The authors further consider the data processing implications of blockchain as if this technology constitutes in itself a data processing activity for which a controller has to be identified. Controllership is, however, decided based on a specific use or deployment of a certain technology. Blockchain, like the internet, is a general-purpose technology that is subsequently deployed by actors for a certain purpose in a specific context. Applying the question of controllership to the internet at large would pose similar data protection issues under the GDPR as identified by the authors in respect of blockchain. This publication explains why none of these issues are currently hampering application of the GDPR to the internet and are equally unlikely to pose issues for blockchain applications. This publication describes the issues in their broader context, as well as how each of these issues can be addressed to ensure compliance with the GDPR. The conclusion is that the GDPR is also well able to regulate this new technology. This does not, however, mean that blockchain will thus be suitable for all use and deployment cases.","[Moerel, Lokke] Tilburg Univ, Global ICT Law, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Moerel, Lokke] Morrison & Foerster Berlin, Berlin, Germany","Tilburg University","Moerel, L (corresponding author), Tilburg Univ, Global ICT Law, Tilburg, Netherlands.;Moerel, L (corresponding author), Morrison & Foerster Berlin, Berlin, Germany.","LMoerel@mofo.com","","","","","","","74","2","2","1","7","KLUWER LAW INT","ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN","ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS","0928-9801","1875-8371","","EUR REV PRIV LAW","Eur.

Unfortunately, traditional PoW schemes require that correct devices perform computational work perpetually, even when the system is not under attack. We address this issue by designing a general PoW protocol that ensures two properties. First, the network stays secure. In particular, the fraction of identities in the system that are controlled by an attacker is always less than 1/2. Second, our protocol's computational cost is commensurate with the cost of an attacker. That is, the total computational cost of correct devices is a linear function of the attacker's computational cost plus the number of correct devices that have joined the system. Consequently, if the network is attacked, we ensure security, with cost that grows linearly with the attacker's cost; and, in the absence of attack, our computational cost is small. We prove similar guarantees for bandwidth cost. Our results hold in a dynamic, decentralized system where participants join and depart over time, and where the total computational power of the attacker is up to a constant fraction of the total computational power of correct devices. We show how to leverage our results to address important security problems in distributed computing including: Sybil attacks, Byzantine Consensus, and Committee Election.","[Gupta, Diksha; Saia, Jared] Dept Comp Sci, Albuquerque, NM 87106 USA; [Young, Maxwell] Comp Sci & Engn Dept, Mississippi State, MS USA","Mississippi State University","Gupta, D (corresponding author), Dept Comp Sci, Albuquerque, NM 87106 USA.","dgupta@cs.unm.edu; saia@cs.unm.edu; myoung@cse.msstate.edu","","Young, Maxwell/0000-0002-5251-8595","National Science Foundation [CCF 1613772, TWC 1318880, AF 1320994]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work is supported by the National Science Foundation grants CCF 1613772, TWC 1318880, AF 1320994, and by a research gift from C Spire.","","86","4","4","0","4","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","","978-1-4503-6372-3","","","","2018","","","","","","","","","","10.1145/3154273.3154333","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3154273.3154333","","","10","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BL8CE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000456048000006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

These find a natural application in the area of Sensor Networks and Cyber-Physical Systems. However, the incentive architecture of blockchains requires massive computational resources for mining, delays in the confirmation of transactions and, more importantly, continuously growing transaction fees, which are ill-suited to systems in which services may be provided by resource-limited devices and confirmation times and transaction costs should be kept minimal, ideally absent. We focus on a new block-less, fee-less paradigm for distributed ledgers suitable for the WSN, IoT and CPS in which transactions are nodes of a directed acyclic graph, that overcomes the limitations of blockchains for these applications, and where e.g. sensors can be at the same time issuers of transactions and validators of previous transactions.

In these entirely online-mediated offerings, entrepreneurs sell tokens registered on a blockchain in exchange for cryptocoins. Buyers receive tokens that can be understood as cryptographically-secured coupons which embody a bundle of rights and obligations. In July 2017, the SEC released an investigative report that highlighted that such tokens can be subject to the full scope of US securities regulation. It is unclear, however, to what extent EU securities regulation is applicable to ICOs and, particularly, whether issuers have to publish and register a prospectus in order to avoid criminal and civil prospectus liability in the E U. In conceptual terms, this depends on whether tokens are considered securities under the EU prospectus regulation regime. Against this background, this paper develops a nuanced approach that distinguishes between three archetypes of tokens: currency, investment, and utility tokens. It analyzes the differential implications of each of these types, and their hybrid forms, for EU securities regulation, and develops policy proposals for their regulation.","[Hacker, Philipp] WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Berlin, Germany; [Hacker, Philipp] UCL, Ctr Law Econ & Soc, London, England; [Hacker, Philipp] UCL, Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England; [Thomale, Chris] Univ Bremen, Fac Law, Bremen, Germany","University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London; University of Bremen","Hacker, P (corresponding author), WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Berlin, Germany.;Hacker, P (corresponding author), UCL, Ctr Law Econ & Soc, London, England.;Hacker, P (corresponding author), UCL, Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England.","","","Thomale, Chris/0000-0002-0878-9910","","","","","122","50","51","4","25","WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH","BERLIN","GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY","1613-2556","","","EUR CO FINANC LAW R","Eur.

Several solutions like AKI and ARPKI have been proposed to address this vulnerability. However, they require complex interactions and synchronization among related entities, and their security has not been validated with wide deployment. We propose an accountable, flexible and efficient decentralized PKI to achieve the same goal using the blockchain technology of Bitcoin, which has been proven to be secure and reliable. The proposed scheme, called BKI, realizes certificate issuance, update and revocation with transactions on a special blockchain that is managed by multiple trusted maintainers. BKI achieves accountability and is easy to check certificate validity, and it is also more secure than centralized PKIs. Moreover, the certificate status update interval of BKI is in seconds, significantly reducing the vulnerability window. In addition, BKI is more flexible than AKI and ARPKI in that the number of required CAs to issue certificates is tunable for different applications.

However, it also introduces several times of deteriorated delay variations caused by process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. In situ timing monitoring-based adaptive techniques can mitigate excessive timing margins caused by PVT variations, but current frequency and/or voltage tuning methods cause large performance loss. In this paper, we propose a low overhead timing error prediction monitor and a super-fast clock stretching circuit to solve this problem. They are both optimized for near-threshold voltage of 0.5 V. When there are timing margins, the frequency will be increased. Until when the timing is intense due to variations, timing monitors will generate a predicted alarm signal. Accordingly, the system clock will be stretched immediately to avoid real timing errors. Applied on a 40-nm CMOS Bitcoin Miner chip, simulation results show that the whole system operating at near-threshold voltage can increase the frequency to up to 2.1x compared with the original non-monitored circuit. Our method can increase the energy efficiency to mitigate near-threshold variations effectively.","[Shan, Weiwei; Liu, Xinning; Lu, Minyi; Wan, Liang; Yang, Jun] Southeast Univ, Natl ASIC Syst Engn Res Ctr, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Southeast University - China","Yang, J (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Natl ASIC Syst Engn Res Ctr, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.","dragon@seu.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61574033, 61774038, 61504065]; National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) [2015AA016601]; National Science and Technology Major Project [2014ZX01030-101]; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui province [1608085QF158]; College Natural Science Foundation of Anhui province [KJ2015A15]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China); National Science and Technology Major Project; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui province(Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province); College Natural Science Foundation of Anhui province(Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61574033, Grant 61774038, and Grant 61504065, in part by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) under Grant 2015AA016601, in part by the National Science and Technology Major Project under Grant 2014ZX01030-101, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Anhui province under Grant 1608085QF158, and in part by the College Natural Science Foundation of Anhui province under Grant KJ2015A15.","","21","2","2","3","13","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2018","6","","","","","","138","145","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2759802","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2759802","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","FU8CC","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000424078700009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Its quality as a technology that produces advanced encryption keys between objects, however, also makes it interesting to those who seek to connect physical objects to digital elements. The reason for this is that the link between objects needs to be 'secure' from undesired external interference. In relation to such interests, blockchain has been identified as a highly attractive technology to support the general digitalization of society towards the Internet of Things, smart cities etc. In extension, the implementation of blockchain technology implies that it may work as a tool that has the capacity to direct which objects may/may not interact with each other. The 'ledger of everything' that blockchain may possibly produce as regards the 'Internet of Everything' is even suggested to make humans and other intermediary technologies redundant. In this essay, I argue that in order to sustain legal critique when the world moves into the next era of digitalization, we need to understand - and question - how technological control operates through e.g. blockchain technology by locking physical and digital elements to each other.","[Kall, Jannice] Halmstad Univ, Sch Business Engn & Sci, Box 823, S-30118 Halmstad, Sweden","Halmstad University","Kall, J (corresponding author), Halmstad Univ, Sch Business Engn & Sci, Box 823, S-30118 Halmstad, Sweden.","jannice.kall@hh.se","","Kall, Jannice/0000-0001-9372-171X","","","","","25","10","10","1","22","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0957-8536","1572-8617","","LAW CRIT","Law Crit.","JUL","2018","29","2","","","","","133","140","","10.1007/s10978-018-9227-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10978-018-9227-x","","","8","Law","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Government & Law","GP8WZ","","hybrid","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000441197700002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

IoT devices can also be used as tools for committing crimes. In this regard, we propose FIF-IoT-a forensic investigation framework using a public digital ledger to find facts in criminal incidents in IoT-based systems. FIF-IoT collects interactions that take place among various IoT entities (clouds, users, and IoT devices) as evidence and store them securely as transactions in a public, distributed and decentralized blockchain network which is similar to the Bitcoin network. Hence, FIF-IoT eliminates a single entity's control over the evidence storage, avoids single-point-of-failure on the storage media, and ensures high availability of evidence. FIF-IoT presents a framework that ensures integrity, confidentiality, anonymity, and non-repudiation of the evidence stored in the public digital ledger. Furthermore, FIF-IoT provides a mechanism to acquire evidence from the ledger and to verify the integrity of the obtained evidence. We present a case study of a forensic investigation to demonstrate that FIF-IoT is secure against evidence tampering. We also implement a prototype to evaluate the performance of FIF-IoT.","[Hossain, Mahmud; Karim, Yasser; Hasan, Ragib] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Comp Sci, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA","University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham","Hossain, M (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Comp Sci, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.","mahmud@uab.edu; yasser@uab.edu; ragib@uab.edu","Hossain, Mahmud/J-2624-2019; Hasan, Ragib/F-4976-2013","Hasan, Ragib/0000-0001-5248-8341; Hossain, Mahmud/0000-0002-4102-8056","National Science Foundation CAREER Award [CNS-1351038, ACI-1642078, SaTC-1723768]","National Science Foundation CAREER Award(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was supported by the National Science Foundation CAREER Award CNS-1351038, ACI-1642078, and SaTC-1723768.","","30","33","34","2","6","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-7244-0","","","","2018","","","","","","","33","40","","10.1109/ICIOT.2018.00012","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICIOT.2018.00012","","","8","Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BM5JI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000465118300005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Over the past few years it has seen a rapid growth, both in terms of research and commercial usage. Due to its decentralized nature and its inherent use of cryptography, Blockchain provides an elegant solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem and is thus a good candidate for use in areas that require a decentralized consensus among untrusted peers, eliminating the need for a central authority. Internet of Things is a technology paradigm where a multitude of small devices, including sensors, actuators and RFID tags, are interconnected via a common communications medium to enable a whole new range of tasks and applications. However, existing IoT installations are often vulnerable and prone to security and privacy concerns. This paper studies the use of Blockchain to strengthen the security of IoT networks through a resilient, decentralized mechanism for the connected home that enhances the network self-defense by safeguarding critical security-related data. This mechanism is developed as part of the Safe-Guarding Home IoT Environments with Personalised Real-time Risk Control (GHOST) project.","[Kouzinopoulos, Charalampos S.; Giannoutakis, Konstantinos M.; Votis, Konstantinos; Tzovaras, Dimitrios] Ctr Res & Technol Hellas, Informat Technol Inst, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Spathoulas, Georgios; Pandey, Pankaj; Katsikas, Sokratis K.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Cyber & Informat Secur, Gjovik, Norway; [Collen, Anastasija; Nijdam, Niels A.] Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland","Centre for Research & Technology Hellas; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Geneva","Giannoutakis, KM (corresponding author), Ctr Res & Technol Hellas, Informat Technol Inst, Thessaloniki, Greece.","kouzinopoulos@iti.gr; gspathoulas@dib.uth.gr; kgiannou@iti.gr; kvotis@iti.gr; pankaj.pandey@ntnu.no; Dimitrios.Tzovaras@iti.gr; sokratis.katsikas@ntnu.no; Anastasija.Collen@unige.ch; Niels.Nijdam@unige.ch","Giannoutakis, Konstantinos/L-9274-2019; Katsikas, Sokratis/AAK-3913-2021; Tzovaras, Dimitrios/ABB-9576-2021","Katsikas, Sokratis/0000-0003-2966-9683; Tzovaras, Dimitrios/0000-0001-6915-6722; Collen, Anastasija/0000-0002-3214-8515; Nijdam, Niels/0000-0002-0172-6319; votis, konstantinos/0000-0001-6381-8326; Giannoutakis, Konstantinos/0000-0001-8939-4912","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme through the GHOST project [740923]","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme through the GHOST project","This work is partially funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme through the GHOST project (https://www.ghost-iot.eu/) under Grant Agreement No. 740923.","","21","14","15","0","5","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","1865-0929","1865-0937","978-3-319-95189-8; 978-3-319-95188-1","COMM COM INF SC","","","2018","821","","","","","","90","100","","10.1007/978-3-319-95189-8_9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-95189-8_9","","","11","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BL5FK","","Green Published, hybrid","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000451341900009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

As this technology has evolved very recently beyond the financial market, gaining more public attention, other promising blockchain applications areas and use cases are emerging. However, it is still not a straightforward in which application areas and use cases blockchains do provide an advantage beyond distributed databases and decentralized systems. Through a decentralized and immutable data storage blockchains enable the enforcement and verification of exchange assets, while disrupting potentially existing business models by promoting the disintermediation of processes involving multiple stakeholders. While having no mediator or a third party controlling the operation, less operational costs and a higher business agility are targeted at. However, the adoption of blockchains requires not only overcoming its technical challenges, but it also implies to reach the ability to understand and handle the impact on existing business models, processes, and legal compliances.

A cross-chain swap is modeled as a directed graph D, whose vertexes are parties and whose arcs are proposed asset transfers. For any pair (D, L), where D = (V, A) is a strongly-connected directed graph and L subset of V a feedback vertex set for D, we give an atomic cross-chain swap protocol for D, using a form of hashed timelock contracts, where the vertexes in L generate the hashlocked secrets.

All these technologies that use the Blockchain pattern show that it is possible to rebuild any transactional system with better performance without relying on any trusted parties to manage transactions between peers. This insight has lead many companies to invest millions to understand the technology and to find a way to migrate from centralized to decentralized solutions. These solutions need to store large amounts of data in a secure and confidential way. Many distributed storage systems now exist using Blockchain technology. But none of the tools proposed are able to manage the document life cycle nor archive documents based on regulatory compliance. In this paper, we describe our protocol named NFB (Notarizing Files over the Blockchain).

Moreover, the multitude of embedded sensors in vehicles can collectively produce a rich data set of the urban landscape that can be used to provide a range of services. Key to the success of this vision is a scalable and private architecture for trusted data sharing. This paper proposes a framework called SpeedyChain, that leverages blockchain technology to allow smart vehicles to share their data while maintaining privacy, integrity, resilience, and non-repudiation in a decentralized and tamper-resistant manner. Differently from traditional blockchain usage (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum), the proposed framework uses a blockchain design that decouples the data stored in the transactions from the block header, thus allowing fast addition of data to the blocks. Furthermore, an expiration time for each block is proposed to avoid large sized blocks.

Typically, these IoT devices are limited in compute, storage, and network capacity, and therefore they are more vulnerable to attacks than other endpoint devices such as smartphones, tablets, or computers. In this paper, we present and survey major security issues for IoT. We review and categorize popular security issues with regard to the IoT layered architecture, in addition to protocols used for networking, communication, and management. We outline security requirements for IoT along with the existing attacks, threats, and state-of-the-art solutions. Furthermore, we tabulate and map IoT security problems against existing solutions found in the literature. More importantly, we discuss, how blockchain, which is the underlying technology for bitcoin, can be a key enabler to solve many IoT security problems. The paper also identifies open research problems and challenges for IoT security. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Excessive centralization increasingly becomes the bottleneck and hinders the further growth of the service ecosystems. As the first attempt to apply the fundamental technique underneath the emerging Bitcoin network into the field of service oriented computing, this paper proposes to build a service ecosystem as a decentralized blockchain-oriented service network, called Decentralized Service Eco-System (DSES). Whenever any activity occurs in the system (e.g., APIs are used together in a published mashup), all involved parties will individually store and maintain a copy of the detailed record (provenance) at their local databases. Such a distributed database-oriented solution will enable services who do not fully trust each other to maintain a set of global states. In this way, service discovery and recommendation can be realized in a distributed manner that promises higher scalability and maintainability. As a proof of concept, a prototyping system of DSES is constructed using the real-world data from ProgrammableWeb. com, based on the INKchain, a newly open-source consortium blockchain mechanism extending the Hyperledger Fabric.","[Gao, Zhenfeng; Fan, Yushun; Wu, Cheng] Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & Technol, Dept Automat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jia] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Chen, Chang] Ziggurat Technol, Zhongguancun SOHO 1010, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Tsinghua University; Carnegie Mellon University","Fan, YS (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & Technol, Dept Automat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.","gzf13@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; fanyus@tsinghua.edu.cn; wuc@tsinghua.edu.cn; jia.zhang@sv.cmu.edu; calvin@ziggurat.cn","Sánchez-Gómez, Nicolás/K-3758-2014","","National Nature Science Foundation of China [61673230]","National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This research has been partially supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (No. 61673230).","","19","6","6","0","6","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-7235-8","","","","2018","","","","","","","25","32","","10.1109/CLOUD.2018.00011","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2018.00011","","","8","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BL6YD","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000454741700004","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The main methods of finding consensus are explained. A brief comparison to centralized systems has been done and its strengths and weaknesses have been outlined. Furthermore, its applications in various domains are discussed in detail. An overview of currently live applications in these domains like bitcoin for cryptocurrency is made, and the role of blockchain in these applications is discussed.

In case of a fork of the chain, Bitcoin's rule for achieving consensus is selecting the longest chain and discarding the other chain as stale. It has been demonstrated that this consensus rule has a weakness against selfish mining in which the selfish miner exploits the variance in block generation by partially withholding blocks. In Ethereum, however, under certain conditions stale blocks don't have to be discarded but can be referenced from the main chain as uncle blocks yielding a partial reward. This concept limits the impact of network delays on the expected revenue for miners. But the concept also reduces the risk for a selfish miner to gain no rewards from withholding a freshly minted block. This paper uses a Monte Carlo simulation to quantify the effect of uncle blocks both to the profitability of selfish mining and the blockchain's security in Ethereum (ETH). A brief outlook about a recent Ethereum Classic (ETC) improvement proposal that weighs uncle blocks during the selection of the main chain will be given.","[Ritz, Fabian; Zugenmaier, Alf] Munich Univ Appl Sci, Munich, Germany; [Zugenmaier, Alf] Concordia Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada","University of Munich; Concordia University - Canada","Ritz, F (corresponding author), Munich Univ Appl Sci, Munich, Germany.","fabian.ritz@hm.edu; alf.zugenmaier@hm.edu","","Ritz, Fabian/0000-0001-7707-1358","","","","","25","32","33","0","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-5445-3","","","","2018","","","","","","","50","57","","10.1109/EuroSPW.2018.00013","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EuroSPW.2018.00013","","","8","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BO4TP","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000515349700006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Inspired by the blockchain, this paper proposes a model based on blockchain to ensure the credibility of video evidence, which is called Video-Chain. VideoChain is essentially a blockchain system, but different from digital currency such as Bitcoin. It records the hash of the surveillance video. This paper takes the campus Video Surveillance as an example to describe the architecture and operation of VideoChain. We also give a consensus protocol based on the proof of stake according to the application scenario. The analysis shows that VideoChain is traceable and non-tampering, which can effectively ensure the credibility of video surveillance data. It also has good operational efficiency. This research is of great significance to enhance the trust between the government and citizens, which will improve the credibility of the government.","[Liu, Mingda; Shang, Jing; Liu, Peng; Shi, Yijuan; Wang, Mian] Jiangnan Inst Comp Technol, Wuxi 214083, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","","Liu, MD; Shang, J; Liu, P; Shi, YJ; Wang, M (corresponding author), Jiangnan Inst Comp Technol, Wuxi 214083, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.","happyliumd@163.com","","liu, ming da/0000-0002-3939-5594","","","","","11","5","5","0","4","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-00015-8; 978-3-030-00014-1","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","11066","","","","","","48","58","","10.1007/978-3-030-00015-8_5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00015-8_5","","","11","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BN3AC","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000478560600005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, most current blockchain projects have concentrated on financial model by using existing platforms such as Bitcoin or Ethereum to generate tokens without the development of the technological features. Unfortunately, the decentralization has several challenges which cannot be adopted by our current political, economic and social systems. The fundamental technical problem of current blockchain algorithm is that 'performance inefficiency' could not be solved, in comparison with the central server system. In addition, the client software cannot establish conventions for making decisions about the future direction of the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, users' completed anonymity and the absence of a responsible person are also open problems of decentralization. To this end, this paper proposes an alternative method, dubbed RCANE which is semi centralized network of parallel blockchain and APoS (Authorized Proof of Stake), whose purpose is to solve the above challenges of current blockchain and comply with our preconceived perspectives of the current political, social, and economic systems to build up an ecosystem for economy, society and politics.

PoW provides blockchain security in trusless P2P environments, but comes at the expense of wasting huge amounts of energy. In this research work, we question this energy expenditure of PoW under blockchain use cases where some form of trust exists between the peers. We propose a Proof-of-Trust (PoT) blockchain where peer trust is valuated in the network based on a trust graph that emerges in a decentralized fashion and that is encoded in and managed by the blockchain itself.

It promises building better trust, transparency, and integrity without a third-party and the risk of censorship. These remarkable advantages do however come at a price. The blockchain ecosystem is riddled with human-centric and economical issues for its participants, leading to unintended consequences in decentralized networks. Gamified software engineering is a growing field that in particular taps into gamification technology, the application of game mechanics in non-game contexts, to address human-related concerns. There are currently no studies around blockchain that have been identified to have a clear view of existing research and solutions for utilizing the gamification in the emerging blockchain systems.

As hard-coded addresses are easy to block and thus render the malware installation inoperable, malware writers have turned to dynamically generated addresses. Domain generation algorithms (DGA) generate a list of candidate domain names, each valid for only a short time, at which the malware installation searches for its command & control (C&C) server. As DGAs generate a large list of potential domains - out of which one or a few is actually in use -, they leave a characteristic trace of many failed DNS lookups (NXDomain) in the network, and in result most DGAs can be efficiently detected. In this paper we describe an entirely new principle of domain generation, actively deployed in the Cerber ransomware, which finds and coordinates with its owner based on transaction information in the bitcoin blockchain. This allows the malware author to dynamically update the location of the server in realtime, and as the malware directly goes to the right location no longer generates a sequence of NXDomain responses. We describe the concept of coordination via the blockchain, and report results on a year-long observation of the assets used in the Cerber campaign.","[Pletinckx, Stijn; Trap, Cyril; Doerr, Christian] Delft Univ Technol, Cyber Secur Grp, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands","Delft University of Technology","Pletinckx, S (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Cyber Secur Grp, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands.","S.R.G.Pletinckx@student.tudelft.nl; C.H.Trap@student.tudelft.nl; c.doerr@tudelft.nl","","","","","","","15","9","9","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2474-025X","","978-1-5386-4586-4","IEEE CONF COMM NETW","","","2018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BL3CW","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000449531900068","View Full Record in Web of Science"

While the contribution of these companies is undeniable, their design is necessarily affected by their economic interests, which may or may not align with those of the users, raising concerns regarding their effect on the availability of information around the globe. While multiple academic and commercial projects aimed to distribute and democratize the Web search, they failed to gain much traction, mostly due to inferior results and lack of incentives for participation. In this paper, we show how complex networking-intensive tasks can be crowdsourced using Bitcoin's incentive model. We present Webcoin, a novel distributed digital-currency which utilizes networking resources rather then computational, and can only be mined through Web indexing.

In this paper, we present an application of smart contracts running on a permissioned distributed ledger (essentially a private blockchain where only credentialed participants are allowed to read and write) to managing tenant and service accounts in a cloud computing data center. The system is called Saranyu and it supports four services: identity management, authentication, authorization, and charging. Identity management and authentication are handled using client-generated public/private key pairs in the usual fashion. Authorization is handled as a contract from a grantee of service access rights to a recipient which is a tenant or other service. Charging is supported by Saranyu integration with payment gateways for payments related to service resource usage. We describe an implementation of Saranyu on top of the Quorum blockchain system. We believe the security, non-repudiation, tamper-resistance, and easy transaction history access brought by blockchain technology will increase transparency and trust in cloud tenant and service management and that the fundamentally distributed nature of the blockchain will make Saranyu an excellent match with developing distributed cloud architectures.","[Nayak, Sambit; Narendra, Nanjangud C.; Shukla, Anshu] Ericsson Res Bangalore, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Kempf, James] Ericsson Res, Santa Clara, CA USA","Ericsson","Nayak, S (corresponding author), Ericsson Res Bangalore, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.","sambit.nayak@ericsson.com; nanjangud.narendra@ericsson.com; anshu.shukla@ericsson.com; james.kempf@ericsson.com","Sánchez-Gómez, Nicolás/K-3758-2014","","","","","","9","23","23","0","6","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-7235-8","","","","2018","","","","","","","857","861","","10.1109/CLOUD.2018.00121","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2018.00121","","","5","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BL6YD","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000454741700114","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Particularly topical is the fact that discussions at the state level over the prospects of legalization of the crypto currency market and the possibilities of using its instruments in the economic activities of economic agents have intensified in recent months. Despite at times polar views and approaches that have been formed at the moment among Russian experts regarding solution of this issue, the development of cryptology is extremely rapid regardless of its regulation. This causes and actualizes the conduct of scientific research in the field of assessing the prospects for the development of this market in order to predict possible effects and risks for the national economic system. Part of this paper is devoted to the solution of these issues aimed at developing a multifactor model for the development of the crypto currency market taking into account the impact of a system of fundamental and conjuncture factors on it. In accordance with the goal, such tasks have been solved as the analysis of the crypto currency market capitalization dynamics and, based on the methods of economic and mathematical modeling, identification of the parameters determining the trajectories and the dynamics of its development. Based on the methods of scenario analysis, the developed econometric model allowed a medium-term forecast to build for the development of the market under study.","[Safiullin, Marat R.] Kazan Fed Univ, 18 Kremlyovskaya St, Kazan 420008, Russia; [Abdukaeva, Aliya A.; Elshin, Leonid A.] Acad Sci Republ Tatarstan, State Budgetary Inst, Ctr Perspect Econ Res, Bauman St 20, Kazan 420013, Respublika Tata, Russia","Kazan Federal University","Safiullin, MR (corresponding author), Kazan Fed Univ, 18 Kremlyovskaya St, Kazan 420008, Russia.","editor@ores.su; info@ores.su; Leonid.Elshin@tatar.ru","Abdukaeva, Aliya/ABF-4413-2020; Safiullin, Marat/Q-4785-2019","Safiullin, Marat/0000-0003-3708-8184"," [26.8732.2017 / BC]","","The work was carried out at the expense of the subsidy granted to the Kazan State University for the performance of the state task in the field of scientific activity (No. 26.8732.2017 / BC)","","12","0","0","1","7","MAGNANIMITAS","HRADEC KRALOVE","CESKOSLOVENSKE ARMADY 300, HRADEC KRALOVE, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC","1804-7890","","","AD ALTA-INTERDISCIP","AD ALTA-J.

A network analysis of the literature was performed to identify the most popularly documented digital sectors in this context, which include the Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare, supply chain management, and government sectors. For each sector, this review documents use cases in which an attempt is made to implement blockchain solutions. The main purpose of this paper is to probe each sector for the growing maturity of blockchain technology and to document the unique benefits and challenges arising from the use of this technology. The findings show that despite the growing reputation of blockchain technology, its implementation within these four sectors remains in infancy because the use cases lack concrete evaluations of its effectiveness and plausibility.

The reliability and immutability of blockchain in addition to the decentralized trustless data processing offers promising solutions for modern enterprise systems. However, current blockchain proposals do not support spatio-temporal data processing. Further, a block-based sequential access data structure in the blockchain restricts efficient query processing. Therefore, a blockchain system is desirable that not only supports spatio-temporal data management but also provides efficient query processing. In this work, we propose efficient query processing for spatio-temporal blockchain data. We consider a spatio-temporal blockchain that records both time and location attributes for the transactions. The data storage and integrity is maintained by the introduction of a cryptographically signed tree data structure, a variant of Merkle KD-tree, which also supports fast spatial queries. For the temporal attribute, we consider Bitcoin like near uniform block generation and process temporal queries by a block-DAG data structure without the introduction of temporal indexes. For current position verification, we use Merkle-Patricia-Trie. We also propose a random graph model to generate a block-DAG topology for an abstract peer-to-peer network. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the applicability and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","[Nurgaliev, Ildar] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Coll Adv Technol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Nurgaliev, Ildar; Muzammal, Muhammad; Qu, Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, CAS","Qu, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.","ildar@siat.ac.cn; muzammal@siat.ac.cn; qiang@siat.ac.cn","Muzammal, Muhammad/AAE-8185-2022; Nurgaliev, Ildar/Q-7149-2019","Muzammal, Muhammad/0000-0001-8817-1629; Nurgaliev, Ildar/0000-0002-2547-3416","CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program, China [Y84402]; CAS President's International Fellowship Initiative, China [2018VTB0005]","CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program, China; CAS President's International Fellowship Initiative, China","The work was partially supported by the CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program, China [grant number Y84402, 2017], and CAS President's International Fellowship Initiative, China [grant number 2018VTB0005, 2018].","","20","10","10","1","6","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-02922-7; 978-3-030-02921-0","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","11233","","","","","","36","51","","10.1007/978-3-030-02922-7_3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-02922-7_3","","","16","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BS4EX","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000718611400003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Rather than relying on centralized intermediaries (e.g., banks) this technology allows two parties to transact directly using duplicate, linked ledgers called blockchains. This makes transactions considerably more transparent than those provided by centralized systems. As a result, transactions are executed without relying on explicit trust [of a third party], but on the distributed trust based on the consensus of the network (i.e., other blockchain users). Applying this technology to improve supply chain transparency has many possibilities. Every product has a long and storied history. However, much of this history is presently obscured. Often, when negative practices are exposed, they quickly escalate to scandalous, and financially crippling proportions. There are many recent examples, such as the exposure of child labor upstream in the manufacturing process and the unethical use of rainforest resources. Blockchain may bring supply chain transparency to a new level, but presently academic and managerial adoption of blockchain technologies is limited by our understanding. To address this issue, this research uses the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the concept of technology innovation adoption as a foundational framework for supply chain traceability. A conceptual model is developed and the research culminates with supply chain implications of blockchain that are inspired by theory and literature review.","[Francisco, Kristoffer; Swanson, David] Univ North Florida, Dept Mkt & Logist, 1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA","State University System of Florida; University of North Florida","Swanson, D (corresponding author), Univ North Florida, Dept Mkt & Logist, 1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA.","krisbfrancisco@gmail.com; david.swanson@unf.edu","Swanson, David/AAW-4561-2021","Swanson, David/0000-0003-2389-9293","","","","","43","290","294","18","66","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2305-6290","","LOGISTICS-BASEL","Logistics","MAR","2018","2","1","","","","","","","2","10.3390/logistics2010002","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/logistics2010002","","","13","Management; Operations Research & Management Science","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science","VK2YT","","Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000672627100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

As Blockchain networks evolve to industrial deployments with large numbers of geographically distributed nodes, the block transfer and processing delays arise as a critical issue which may create greater potential for forks and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Motivated by these issues, we develop stochastic network models to capture the Blockchain evolution and dynamics and analyze the impact of the block dissemination delay and hashing power of the member nodes on Blockchain performance in terms of the overall block generation rate and required computational power for launching a successful attack. The results provide useful insight in crucial design issues, e.g., how to adjust the `difficulty-of-work' in the presence of delay so as to achieve a target block generation rate or appropriate level of immunity from adversarial attacks. We employ a combination of analytical calculations and simulation experiments to investigate both stationary and transient performance features, and demonstrate close agreement with measurements on a wide-area network testbed running the Ethereum protocol.","[Papadis, Nikolaos; Tassiulas, Leandros] Nokia Bell Labs, 600 Mt Ave, Murray Hill, NJ 07974 USA; [Borst, Sem; Walid, Anwar; Grissa, Mohamed] Yale Univ, Dept Elect Engn, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Borst, Sem; Walid, Anwar; Grissa, Mohamed] Yale Univ, Yale Inst Network Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Nokia Corporation; Nokia Bell Labs; Yale University; Yale University","Papadis, N (corresponding author), Nokia Bell Labs, 600 Mt Ave, Murray Hill, NJ 07974 USA.","","","","US Office of Naval Research (ONR) [N00014-14-1-2190]; U.S. Army Research Laboratory; U.K. Ministry of Defence [W911NF-16-3-0001]","US Office of Naval Research (ONR)(Office of Naval Research); U.S. Army Research Laboratory(United States Department of DefenseUS Army Research Laboratory (ARL)); U.K. Ministry of Defence","The research of N.

The problems were seen far in advance, but it was commonplace belief that a combination of cryptography and more distributed responsibilty in systems-blockchains for everything, and all hail the cloud'-would together restore what had been lost in the first decades of the 21st century. As it turned out, it was these very technologies that ended up destroying the privacy and trust we had left. In this review, we argue that the mistake collectively made was to think of privacy and trust as technological problems, when in fact they are properties of social and political systems. If we are to recover from what we call the BlockCloud Apocalypse, humans and machines are going to have to figure out how to build systems that support privacy and trust in society, rather than attempt to replace it with trust in technical validations. We propose a return to trust in humanitarian motives rather than technological supremacy.","[Somayaji, Anil] Carleton Univ, Virtual, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Carleton University","Somayaji, A (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Virtual, Ottawa, ON, Canada.","mark.burgess.oslo.mbv17@gmail.com; somav24@scs.carleton.ca","Somayaji, Anil Buntwal/AHB-1690-2022","","Bitcoin Memorial Foundation; Canada's NSERC","Bitcoin Memorial Foundation; Canada's NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","we would like to thank the Bitcoin Memorial Foundation for a generous grant of CPUMEM for the crawling and computation of this manuscript.

Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing block chain platforms that require smart-contracts to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks. This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.","[Androulaki, Elli; Barger, Artem; Bortnikov, Vita; Cachin, Christian; Christidis, Konstantinos; De Caro, Angelo; Enyeart, David; Ferris, Christopher; Laventman, Gennady; Manevich, Yacov; Muralidharan, Srinivasan; Murthy, Chet; Binh Nguyen; Sethi, Manish; Singh, Gari; Smith, Keith; Sorniotti, Alessandro; Stathakopoulou, Chrysoula; Vukolic, Marko; Cocco, Sharon Weed; Yellick, Jason] IBM Corp, Armonk, NY 10504 USA; [Muralidharan, Srinivasan; Binh Nguyen] State St Corp, Boston, MA USA","International Business Machines (IBM)","Androulaki, E (corresponding author), IBM Corp, Armonk, NY 10504 USA.","","Barger, Artem/AAS-1082-2020","Barger, Artem/0000-0002-7303-483X","European Union [643964]; Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) [15.0091]","European Union(European Commission); Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI)","This work was supported in part by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme under grant agreement number 643964 (SUPERCLOUD) and in part by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) under contract number 15.0091.","","44","1416","1493","47","254","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","","","978-1-4503-5584-1","","","","2018","","","","","","","","","","10.1145/3190508.3190538","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3190508.3190538","","","15","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BM1RZ","","Green Submitted, Bronze","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000460467600030","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, the use of blockchain in mobile environments is still limited because the mining process consumes too much computing and energy resources on mobile devices. Edge computing offered by the Edge Computing Service Provider (ECSP) can be adopted as a viable solution for offloading the mining tasks from the mobile devices, i.e., miners, in the mobile blockchain environment. However, a mechanism for edge resource allocation to maximize the revenue for the ECSP and to ensure incentive compatibility and individual rationality is still open. In this paper, we develop an optimal auction based on deep learning for the edge resource allocation. Specifically, we construct a multi-layer neural network architecture based on an analytical solution of the optimal auction. The neural networks first perform monotone transformations of the miners' bids. Then, they calculate allocation and conditional payment rules for the miners. We use valuations of the miners as the training data to adjust parameters of the neural networks so as to optimize the loss function which is the expected, negated revenue of the ECSP. We show the experimental results to confirm the benefits of using the deep learning for deriving the optimal auction for mobile blockchain with high revenue.","[Nguyen Cong Luong; Xiong, Zehui; Wang, Ping; Niyato, Dusit] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore","Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University","Luong, NC (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore.","","Xiong, Zehui/B-9792-2019","Xiong, Zehui/0000-0002-4440-941X","MOE Tier 1 [RG 33/16, 2017-T1-002-007]; MOE Tier 2 [MOE2014-T2-2-015 ARC4/15, NRF2015-NRF-ISF001-2277]","MOE Tier 1(Ministry of Education, Singapore); MOE Tier 2(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","This work was supported in part by MOE Tier 1 (RG 33/16), MOE Tier 1 under Grant 2017-T1-002-007, MOE Tier 2 under Grant MOE2014-T2-2-015 ARC4/15 and NRF2015-NRF-ISF001-2277.","","11","87","87","0","6","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1550-3607","","978-1-5386-3180-5","IEEE ICC","","","2018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Telecommunications","BO5ZI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000519271304030","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Without a trustworthy binding between user-facing names, such as domain names, and cryptographic identities, such as public keys, all security guarantees against. active attackers come crashing down like a house of cards. Blockchains such as Bitcoin, by offering a decentralized yet secure public ledger, show promise as the root of trust for naming systems with no central trusted parties, greatly increasing their security compared to traditional centralized PKIs. Yet blockchain PKIs such as Namecoin and Blockstack tend to significantly sacrifice scalability and flexibility in pursuit of decentralization, hindering large-scale deployability on the Internet. We propose Bitforest, a secure naming system with an architecture combining a centralized yet only partially trusted name server with efficiently queryable verification data embedded in a novel data structure inside a cryptocurrency blockchain. Bitforest achieves decentralized trust and security as strong as existing blockchain-based naming systems while retaining most of the flexibility and performance of centralized PKIs, allowing fully validating thin clients to look up and verify name bindings with comparable efficiency to traditional systems. We use both numerical simulation and real-world experiments to evaluate the performance of Bitforest compared with other naming systems, both centralized and blockchain-based, showing that its performance goals are indeed achieved.","[Dong, Yuhao; Kim, Woojung; Boutaba, Raouf] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada","University of Waterloo","Dong, YH (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.","yd2dong@uwaterloo.ca; w3kim@uwaterloo.ca; rboutaba@uwaterloo.ca","Boutaba, Raouf/AAT-2801-2020; Boutaba, Raouf/G-8483-2017","Boutaba, Raouf/0000-0001-7936-6862","","","","","13","3","3","0","4","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2165-9605","","978-3-9031-7614-0","INT CONF NETW SER","","","2018","","","","","","","226","232","","","","","","7","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BM0OG","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000458916300028","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We examine whether the transformative potential of drug cryptomarkets has been realized in two ways: Are cryptomarket drug sellers found in production and transit countries? and Do we see the increased use of shipping across international borders over time? Method: Using data collected by the DATACRYPTO software tool between 2013 and 2016, we characterize cryptomarket buyer behavior through the product reviews (i.e., sales transactions) posted on 15 cryptomarkets. Findings: Cryptomarket drug sellers are predominantly based in countries of Europe, North America, and Oceania. For both cannabis resin and cocaine sold on cryptomarkets, we find that known production and transit countries are not the primary sources of supplied drugs but rather key countries of consumption. In the case of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, we observe that the Netherlands, a known production country, is the largest supplier. We further observe tendencies over time toward increased localization of cryptomarkets with regard to product destinations. Discussion: Though cryptomarkets offer a potentially global platform for drug distribution, they do not tend to be used as such. We explain our results with reference to buyers' preferences regarding safety, risk, and convenience, alongside structural limitations for cryptomarket use such as bitcoin availability.","[Demant, Jakob] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Sociol, Buld 16, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Munksgaard, Rasmus] Univ Montreal, Sch Criminol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Decary-Hetu, David] Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Aldridge, Judith] Univ Manchester, Sch Law, Criminol, Oxford, England","University of Copenhagen; Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; University of Manchester","Demant, J (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Sociol, Buld 16, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark.","jd@soc.ku.dk","Munksgaard, Rasmus/H-9688-2019; Demant, Jakob/G-7347-2015; Andersen, Rasmus/GWD-0055-2022","Munksgaard, Rasmus/0000-0002-2306-3309; Demant, Jakob/0000-0003-3333-224X; Decary-Hetu, David/0000-0002-4360-140X","","","","","57","36","36","2","21","SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","THOUSAND OAKS","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","1057-5677","1556-3855","","INT CRIM JUSTICE REV","Int.

The time to complete a simple pairwise transaction from one virtual wallet to other takes time in proof-of-work where transactions are added into the Blockchain. At the same time, validating a pairwise transaction is very significant in this new technology as a payment option. Through this study, we propose a heuristic approach for validating pairwise transactions on cryptocurrencies. Our heuristic simulate all entities sending and receiving transactions among themselves. We use SHA256 algorithm to enhance our solution for pairwise transactions, creating a local Blockchain of transactions that has been used in the development of various Blockchain systems. For our experiments, we ran simulations in-file and in-memory with 2 million transactions in 290.39 and 5.34 seconds respectively. Our peak transactions per second was 6.887 using a file persistence version and 374.255 with in-memory version. Based on our experiments we conclude that is possible to improve the number of transactions processed per second increasing the size of the block as well as avoiding access to the file during the simulation.

While the Bitcoin blockchain is relatively simple to reason about as, effectively, a hash chain, more complex public ledgers are largely designed without any formalization of desired cryptographic properties such as authentication or integrity. These designs are then implemented without assurances against real-world bugs leading to little assurance with regards to practical, real-world security. Ledger Design Language (LDL) is a modeling language for describing public ledgers. The LDL compiler produces two outputs. The first output is a an applied-pi calculus symbolic model representing the public ledger as a protocol. Using ProVerif, the protocol can be played against an active attacker, whereupon we can query for block integrity, authenticity and other properties. The second output is a formally verified read/write API for interacting with the public ledger in the real world, written in the F-star programming language. F-star features such as dependent types allow us to validate a block on the public ledger, for example, by type-checking it so that its signing public key be a point on a curve. Using LDL's outputs, public ledger designers obtain automated assurances on the theoretical coherence and the real-world security of their designs with a single framework based on a single modeling language.","[Kobeissi, Nadim] INRIA Paris, Symbol Software, Paris, France; [Kulatova, Natalia] INRIA Paris, Paris, France","","Kobeissi, N (corresponding author), INRIA Paris, Symbol Software, Paris, France.","","","Kobeissi, Nadim/0000-0001-6756-7253","","","","","14","0","0","0","0","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-5445-3","","","","2018","","","","","","","162","166","","10.1109/EuroSPW.2018.00031","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EuroSPW.2018.00031","","","5","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BO4TP","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000515349700022","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Computational puzzles have long been investigated as a possible sybil defense: If a node fails to solve the puzzle in a timely fashion, it will no longer be accepted by other nodes. However, it is still possible for a malicious node to behave in such a way that it is accepted by some honest nodes but not other honest nodes. This results in different honest nodes having different views on which set of nodes should form the system. Such view divergence, unfortunately, breaks the overarching assumption required by many existing security protocols. Partly spurred by the growing popularity of Bitcoin, researchers have recently formalized the above view divergence problem and proposed interesting solutions (which we call view reconciliation protocols). For example, in CRYPTO 2015, Andrychowicz and Dziembowski proposed a view reconciliation protocol with Theta(N) time complexity, with N being the number of honest nodes in the system. All existing view reconciliation protocols so far have a similar Theta(N) time complexity. As this paper's main contribution, we propose a novel view reconciliation protocol with a time complexity of only Theta(ln N/ln ln N). To achieve such an exponential improvement, we aggressively exploit randomization.","[Hou, Ruomu; Jahja, Irvan; Loi Luu; Saxena, Prateek; Yu, Haifeng] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Comp Sci, Singapore, Singapore","National University of Singapore","Hou, RM (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Comp Sci, Singapore, Singapore.","houruomu@u.nus.edu; irvan@comp.nus.edu.sg; loiluu@comp.nus.edu.sg; prateeks@comp.nus.edu.sg; haifeng@comp.nus.edu.sg","","","Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier-1 [T1 251RES1616]; DSO, Singapore [R-252-000-661-592]","Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier-1(Ministry of Education, Singapore); DSO, Singapore(DSO National Laboratories)","The authors of this paper are alphabetically ordered.

Many blockchain-based data sharing applications, such as sharing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) among different Care Delivery Organizations (CDOs), require privacy preserving verification services with dual capabilities. On one hand, the users want to verify the authenticity of EHR data as well as the identity of the signer. On the other hand, the signer wants to keep his real identity private such that others cannot trace and infer his identity information. However, typical blockchain systems that use pseudonyms as public keys, such as Bitcoin's blockchain, cannot support such privacy-preserving verification. In such systems, it is hard to verify the authenticity of signer's identity, and adversaries or curious parties can guess the real identity from the series of statements and actions taken with a specific pseudonym through inference attacks, such as by transaction graph analysis. In this paper, we propose a decentralized attribute-based signature scheme for healthcare blockchain, which provides efficient privacy-preserving verification of authenticity of EHR data and signer's identity. We also describe a holistic on-chain and off-chain collaborative storage system for efficient storage and verification EHR data. The analysis and experiments show that our scheme is effective and deployable.","[Sun, You; Zhang, Rui; Wang, Xin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, State Key Lab Informat Secur, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Sun, You; Zhang, Rui; Wang, Xin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Cyber Secur, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Gao, Kaiqiang] China Elect Power Res Inst, Beijing 100192, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ling] Georgia Inst Technol, Coll Comp, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Engineering, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology","Sun, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, State Key Lab Informat Secur, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.;Sun, Y (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Cyber Secur, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.","sunyou@iie.ac.cn; zhangrui@iie.ac.cn; wangxin@iie.ac.cn; kaiqiang.gao@gmail.com; lingliu@cc.gatech.edu","","","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB1400700]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61472414, 61772514, 61602061]; USA National Science Foundation [CNS-1115375, NSF 1547102, SaTC 1564097]; IBM","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); USA National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); IBM(International Business Machines (IBM))","The authors from Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences acknowledge the partial support from National Key R&D Program of China under Grant No. 2017YFB1400700 and National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No.: 61472414, 61772514, 61602061.

Bitcoin, first released in 2009, breeds the decentralized Blockchain technology. The decentralization, anonymity and proof of security characteristics of Blockchain can prevent collusion and single point failure of a centralized server. We believe that the application of Blockchain into the IoT system can clear the obstacles facing the development of IoT architecture and security. To this end, we propose an out-of-band two-factor authentication scheme for IoT devices based on Blockchain infrastructure. We implemented the IoT and Blockchain integrated system with Eris Blockchain and equivalent computing devices to emulate IoT devices. The overheads to run Blockchain and smart contract services on the emulator devices are measured.

As it is well-known, cooperative computing is an effective and traditional approach, and it is widely used in various fields. Inspired by this idea, take E-commerce for example, Security is one of its important indicators. In E-commerce, the security technology has become a major issue restricting the rapid development and popularization of E-commerce. Existing solutions leverage blockchain protocols to improve the credibility of transactions, but most of them have some limitations, such as a lower throughput and higher consensus latency, and these problems make blockchain technology difficult to be widely used. This paper presents a trusted framework (ETTF) using blockchain protocol in E-commerce to achieve a higher credible trading. ETTF includes a peer blockchain protocol (PBP) based on a peer blockchain architecture to support the storage of massive transactions and instant transactions. In PBP, the throughput scales are nearly linearly increased with the computation: the more computing power available, the more blocks are selected per unit time. Besides, in order to ensure a higher security of transactions we have introduced a strong consensus algorithm(ECA) in E-commerce. ETTF is also efficient because the number of messages it requires is nearly linear in the network size. Compared to Bitcoin-derived blockchain, ETTF shows better performance on throughput, latency, and capacity in E-commerce.","[Xie, Wenlin; Kong, Lanju; Min, Xinping; Xiao, Zongshui; Li, Qingzhong] Shandong Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Li, Qingzhong] Dareway Software Co Ltd, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Wei] CPC Shandong Prov Part Sch Lib, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiangdong] State Grid Chongqing Elect Power Corp, Customer Serv Ctr, Chongqing, Peoples R China","Shandong University; Chongqing Electric Power Corp","Kong, LJ (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.","klj@sdu.edu.cn","","","NSFC [61772316]; Science and Technology Development Plan Project of Shandong Province [2016GGX101008, 2017CXGC0702]; Shandong Province Independent Innovation Major Special Project [2016ZDJS01A09]; Taishan Industrial Experts Programme of Shandong Province","NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Development Plan Project of Shandong Province; Shandong Province Independent Innovation Major Special Project; Taishan Industrial Experts Programme of Shandong Province","This work is partially supported by NSFC No.61772316; the Science and Technology Development Plan Project of Shandong Province No. 2016GGX101008, No. 2017CXGC0702; Shandong Province Independent Innovation Major Special Project No. 2016ZDJS01A09, the Taishan Industrial Experts Programme of Shandong Province.","","18","6","7","0","11","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-1482-2","INT C COMP SUPP COOP","","","2018","","","","","","","612","617","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BN4KZ","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000482133300106","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Because of its efficiency and functionality, it is widely considered to have revolutionary application prospects. As a supporting part of the data structure, the hash function is important for ensuring the availability and security of the blockchain. To evaluate the security of blockchain technology it is important to analyze several security criteria of the hash functions used in the blockchain. This paper focuses on two security criteria-hiding and puzzle-friendliness-that the hash function should satisfy in the blockchain proposed by Narayanan et al. (Narayanan A, Bonneau J, Felten E, et al. Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies: A Comprehensive Introduction. Princeton University Press, 2016). Under the framework of Rogaway-Shrimpton's theory, their definitions are mathematically described and their relation is proved. Also, comparisons between the two criteria and traditional ones in hash functions are made. The conclusions of this paper point out that for hash functions, it is harder to break hiding and puzzle-friendliness than to break preimage resistance, which shows that hash functions proven to be preimage-resistant or tested by preimage cryptanalysis like SHA256 tend to be enough to be used in the corresponding parts of the blockchain design. At the same time, from the attackers' view the conclusions can provide a theoretical basis for studying the potential attacks on and defects that may exist in the structure of the hash functions applied in the blockchain.","[Wang, Maoning; Duan, Meijiao; Zhu, Jianming] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Informat, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Central University of Finance & Economics","Wang, MN (corresponding author), Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Informat, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.","13854139297@139.com; duanmeijiao@cufe.edu.cn; zjm@cufe.edu.cn","","","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB1400700]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1509214, 61702570]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","The work is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant No. 2017YFB1400700 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. U1509214, 61702570.

All security guarantees against active attackers come from a trustworthy binding between user-facing names, such as domain names, to cryptographic identities, such as public keys. By offering a secure, distributed ledger with highly decentralized trust, blockchains such as Bitcoin show promise as the root of trust for naming systems with no central trusted parties. PKIs based upon blockchains, such as Namecoin and Blockstack, have greatly improved security and resilience compared to traditional centralized PKIs. Yet blockchain PKIs tend to significantly sacrifice scalability and flexibility in pursuit of decentralization, hindering large-scale deployability on the Internet. We propose Conifer, a novel PKI with an architecture based upon CONIKS, a centralized transparency-based PKI, and Catena, a blockchain-agnostic way of embedding a permissioned log, but with a different lookup strategy. In doing so, Conifer achieves decentralized trust with security at least as strong as existing blockchain-based naming systems, yet without sacrificing the flexibility and performance typically found in centralized PKIs. We also present our reference implementation of Conifer, demonstrating how it can easily be integrated into applications. Finally, we use experiments to evaluate the performance of Conifer compared with other naming systems, both centralized and blockchain-based, demonstrating that it incurs only a modest overhead compared to traditional centralized-trust systems while being far more scalable and performant than purely blockchain-based solutions.","[Dong, Yuhao; Kim, Woojung; Boutaba, Raouf] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada","University of Waterloo","Dong, YH (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.","yd2dong@uwaterloo.ca; w3kim@uwaterloo.ca; rboutaba@uwaterloo.ca","Boutaba, Raouf/G-8483-2017; Boutaba, Raouf/AAT-2801-2020","Boutaba, Raouf/0000-0001-7936-6862; ","","","","","12","5","5","0","6","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-7975-3","","","","2018","","","","","","","1092","1099","","10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00200","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00200","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BN4AE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000481634500166","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Notably, our work ismotivated by the high energy consumption for mining PoW, and we want to restrict the use of PoW to a configurable, expected size of nodes, as a function of the local blockchain state. The approach we develop for this rests on three pillars: (i) Proof of Kernel Work (PoKW), a means of dynamically reducing the set of nodes that can participate in the solving of PoW puzzles such that an adversary cannot increase his attack surface because of such a reduction; (ii) Practical Adaptation of Existing Technology, a realization of this PoW reduction through an adaptation of existing blockchain and enterprise technology stacks; and (iii) Machine Learning for Adaptive System Resiliency, the use of techniques from artificial intelligence to make our approach adaptive to system, network and attack dynamics. We develop here, in detail, the first pillar and illustrate the second pillar through a real use case, a pilot project done with Porsche on controlling permissions to vehicle and data log accesses. We also discuss pertinent attack vectors for PoKW consensus and their mitigation.

Blockchain technology is a software protocol for the secure transfer of unique instances of value (e.g., money, property, contracts, and identity credentials) via the Internet without requiring a third-party intermediary such as a bank or government. Public Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are trustless (human counterparties and intermediaries do not need to be trusted, just the software) and permissionless (open use), whereas private Blockchains are trusted and permissioned. Enterprise Blockchains are private (trusted, not trustless) immutable decentralized ledgers, with varying methods of reaching consensus (validating and recording transactions). Four enterprise systems are examined: R3's Corda, Ethereum Quorum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Ripple. New business analytics and data science methods are needed such as next-generation artificial intelligence solutions in the form of deep learning algorithms together with Blockchains. The hidden benefit of Blockchain for data analytics is its role in creating clean data: validated, trustable, interoperable, and standardized data. Business Blockchains may develop across industry supply chains with shared business logic and processes, and shared financial ledgers. Payment channels and smart contract asset pledging may allow net settlement across supply chains and reduce debt and working capital obligations. Specific use cases are considered in global automotive supply chains, healthcare, digital identity credentialing, higher education, digital collectibles (CryptoKitties), and asset tokens (Primalbase).","[Swan, Melanie] Purdue Univ, Dept Philosophy, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus","Swan, M (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Philosophy, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.","","Sánchez-Gómez, Nicolás/K-3758-2014","","","","","","40","23","24","9","139","ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC","SAN DIEGO","525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","0065-2458","","978-0-12-813852-6","ADV COMPUT","Adv.

Correlation intractability (CI) captures a strong Random-Oracle-like property of hash functions. In particular, when security holds for all sparse relations, CI suffices for guaranteeing the soundness of the Fiat-Shamir transformation from any constant round, statistically sound interactive proof to a non-interactive argument. However, to date, the only CI hash function for all sparse relations (Kalai et al., Crypto 2017) is based on general program obfuscation with exponential hardness properties. We construct a simple CI hash function for arbitrary sparse relations, from any symmetric encryption scheme that satisfies some natural structural properties, and in addition guarantees that key recovery attacks mounted by polynomial-time adversaries have only exponentially small success probability - even in the context of key-dependent messages (KDM). We then provide parameter settings where ElGamal encryption and Regev encryption plausibly satisfy the needed properties. Our techniques are based on those of Kalai et al., with the main contribution being substituting a statistical argument for the use of obfuscation, therefore greatly simplifying the construction and basing security on better-understood intractability assumptions.

A spectral observer can be catalogued as an online algorithm for time-frequency analysis because is a method that can compute on the fly the Fourier Transform (FT) of a signal, without having the entire signal available from the start. In this regard, this paper presents a novel spectral observer with an adjustable constant gain for reconstructing a given signal by means of the recursive identification of the coefficients of a Fourier series. The reconstruction or estimation of a signal in the context of this work means to find the coefficients of a linear combination of sines a cosines that fits a signal such that it can be reproduced. The design procedure of the spectral observer is presented along with the following applications: (1) the reconstruction of a simple periodical signal, (2) the approximation of both a square and a triangular signal, (3) the edge detection in signals by using the Fourier coefficients, (4) the fitting of the historical Bitcoin market data from 1 December 2014 to 8 January 2018 and (5) the estimation of a input force acting upon a Duffing oscillator.

To ensure the random selection of the verifier of each block, Proof of Works (PoW) is used. However, there is a serious problem with PoW, in that the amount of computation becomes huge. Although Proof of Stake (PoS) has been proposed to reduce the amount of computation, there remains the problem that if there is collusion among nodes, it is possible to control the probability of being the verifier. In this paper, a novel technique, Proof-of-Lucky-ID (PoL), is proposed. PoL is a kind of lottery that guarantees the randomness of the selection of the verifier, even if the node is collaborating unfairly, by using multiple digital signatures created by other nodes as input. Since this technique can determine the verifier with about two hash calculations per node, it significantly reduces the amount of processing compared with PoW, which requires more than 10(boolean AND)19 hash calculations as of 2017. In addition, since the input value cannot be controlled even if there is node collusion, it is impossible to control the probability of a win. Furthermore, compared to PoW and PoS, the certainty of consensus can be estimated with high accuracy in a short time. Numerical calculations show that both the randomness of verifier selection by the proposed method and the accuracy of the certainty of consensus range estimation are sufficiently high.","[Ogawa, Takeshi; Kima, Hayato; Miyaho, Noriharu] Tokyo Denki Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Tokyo 1208585, Japan","Tokyo Denki University","Ogawa, T (corresponding author), Tokyo Denki Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Tokyo 1208585, Japan.","t.ogawa@mail.dendai.ac.jp","Miyaho, Noriharu/AAO-6331-2020","","","","","","11","4","4","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-7975-3","","","","2018","","","","","","","1212","1218","","10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00215","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00215","","","7","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BN4AE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000481634500180","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Unfortunately, NTP is highly vulnerable to time shifting attacks, in which the attacker's goal is to shift forward/backward the local time at an NTP client. NTP's security vulnerabilities have severe implications for time-sensitive applications and for security mechanisms, including TLS certificates, DNS and DNSSEC, RPKI, Kerberos, BitCoin, and beyond. While technically NTP supports cryptographic authentication, it is very rarely used in practice and, worse yet, timeshifting attacks on NTP are possible even if all NTP communications are encrypted and authenticated. We present Chronos, a new NTP client that achieves good synchronization even in the presence of powerful attackers who are in direct control of a large number of NTP servers. Importantly, Chronos is backwards compatible with legacy NTP and involves no changes whatsoever to NTP servers. Chronos leverages ideas from distributed computing literature on clock synchronization in the presence of adversarial (Byzantine) behavior. A Chronos client iteratively crowdsources time queries across multiple NTP servers and applies a provably secure algorithm for eliminating suspicious responses and averaging over the remaining responses. Chronos is carefully engineered to minimize communication overhead so as to avoid overloading NTP servers. We evaluate Chronos' security and network efficiency guarantees via a combination of theoretical analyses and experiments with a prototype implementation. Our results indicate that to succeed in shifting time at a Chronos client by over 100ms from the UTC, even a powerful man-in-the-middle attacker requires over 20 years of effort in expectation.","[Deutsch, Omer; Schiff, Neta Rozen; Dolev, Danny; Schapira, Michael] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Jerusalem, Israel","Hebrew University of Jerusalem","Deutsch, O (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Jerusalem, Israel.","omermaya@gmail.com; neta.rozenschiff@mail.huji.ac.il; danny.dolev@mail.huji.ac.il; schapiram@huji.ac.il","","","Cyber Security Research Center at Hebrew University; Israeli National Cyber Bureau (INCB) in the Prime Minister's Office; ERC Starting Grant","Cyber Security Research Center at Hebrew University; Israeli National Cyber Bureau (INCB) in the Prime Minister's Office; ERC Starting Grant(European Research Council (ERC))","We thank the Cyber Security Research Center at Hebrew University, in conjunction with the Israeli National Cyber Bureau (INCB) in the Prime Minister's Office, for financial support.

JCLedger is a blockchain based distributed ledger for JointCloud computing which can make cloud resources exchange more reliable and convenient, and it is the combination of JointCloud and BlockChain. One of the most important elements for creating JCLedger is the consensus algorithm. PoW (Proof of Work) is the consensus algorithm for Bitcoin, which is proved to be quite safe but needs much computing power. The original PoW is not suitable for JCLedger because the identities of participants are not equal in computing power, which may lead to accounting monopoly, and the throughput cannot satisfy the requirement of the massive and high-frequency transactions in JointCloud. In this paper, we propose a PoW based consensus algorithm called Proof of Participation and Fees (PoPF), which can save much computing power and handled transactions more efficiently for JCLedger. In our design, only the candidates have the opportunities for mining and the candidates are chosen according to the ranking which is determined by two factors: the times of the participant to be the accountant and the fees the participant has paid. The difficulty for candidates of solving the PoW hash puzzle is different (the higher ranking means easier for mining). The simulation experiment shows that the distribution of accountants is well-balanced, that is to say, the unequal computing power of participants in JointCloud is shielded, and all the users who have enough contribution in JCLedger will have the opportunities to be accountants.","[Fu Xiang; Wang Huaimin; Shi Peichang; Mi Haibo] Natl Univ Def Technol, Sci & Technol Parallel & Distributed Lab, Coll Comp, Changsha 410073, Peoples R China","National University of Defense Technology - China","Fu, X (corresponding author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Sci & Technol Parallel & Distributed Lab, Coll Comp, Changsha 410073, Peoples R China.","fuxiang13@nudt.edu.cn","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFB1000100]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61772030, 61502510]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work is supported by The National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFB1000100) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61772030, 61502510).","","17","6","6","0","0","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","2642-6587","2640-8228","978-1-5386-5206-0","IEEE INT SYMP SERV O","","","2018","","","","","","","204","209","","10.1109/SOSE.2018.00034","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SOSE.2018.00034","","","6","Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BT8GE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000853084900025","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Any transaction ever completed is recorded in a public ledger in a verifiable, secure, transparent and permanent way, with a timestamp and other details. Introduced in 2009 as the core mechanism for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency and its worldwide payment system, blockchain has had many applications in domains such as IoT, finance, business, management, health and education. Also new platforms and tools for blockchain implementation were developed. As education becomes more open, diversified, democratised, and decentralised, the blockchain technology is taken in consideration by researchers, teachers and institutions, to maintain reputation, trust in certification, and proof of learning. In the first part of the paper, we explore the blockchain technology. Next, existing global and governmental initiatives, together with potential applications of blockchain in different domains are presented. The need to learn about this emerging technology is demonstrated, together with pioneering cases in different universities. Then we propose a public blockchain called OpenEduChain, designed as a repository for open educational assets (Open Educational Resources - OERs, Massive Open Online Courses - MOOCs, open pedagogies and scenarios), but also to deliver issued certificates and open badges by universities and other educational and training institutions. At university level, OpenEduChain, implemented on Ethereum, is used to store data about the open educational items created by faculty members and students. Also digital certificates or open badges are provided to the participants in the trainings and workshops. After a period of tests, OpenEduChain usage could be extended at national level, but also for new purposes such as e-portfolios or assessment.","[Holotescu, Carmen] Ioan Slavici Univ Timisoara, 144 Str Paunescu Podeanu, Timisoara 300569, Romania","Ioan Slavici University","Holotescu, C (corresponding author), Ioan Slavici Univ Timisoara, 144 Str Paunescu Podeanu, Timisoara 300569, Romania.","carmen.holotescu@islavici.ro","Holotescu, Carmen/AGJ-9368-2022","","ERASMUS+ [575370-EPP-1-2016-1-RO-EPPJMO-MODULE]","ERASMUS+","This work was partially supported by a grant of the ERASMUS+, 575370-EPP-1-2016-1-RO-EPPJMO-MODULE.","","37","13","14","1","15","CAROL I NATL DEFENCE UNIV PUBLISHING HOUSE","BUCHAREST","PANDURI ST, 68-72, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA","2066-026X","","","ELEARN SOFTW EDUC","","","2018","","","","","","","275","283","","10.12753/2066-026X-18-253","http://dx.doi.org/10.12753/2066-026X-18-253","","","9","Education & Educational Research","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Education & Educational Research","BM7ZI","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000468620000039","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The interest of the authors of the article is related to the law enforcement requirement and the simultaneous uncertainty of the use of new categories for the Russian state that are of primary importance for its development in the conditions of the development of the digital economy. The aim is to determine the boundaries and objectives of legal regulation of Fintekh and Regtekh; to identify on the basis of scientific analysis the legal essence of these concepts, as well as related categories. The methods used are formal-logical, comparison, analysis, synthesis, comparison, generalization. The results are analysis of the current situation on the use and regulation of financial and regulatory technologies in the Russian Federation, as well as the approaches to determining their legal nature; identification of risks in the application of financial and regulatory technologies, formulating proposals for their prevention and leveling; identification of stages and main directions of legal regulation of financial and regulatory technologies in the Russian Federation; analysis of foreign experience in the legal regulation of financial and regulatory technologies, including in the field of taxation; formulation of proposals for the taxation of certain elements of Fintekh and Regtekh in the Russian Federation. The conclusion is that the state determined the need for legal regulation and identified the main vectors of the movement in the legal field. National legal regulation is at the stage of origin; at present, attempts are made to legalize key concepts in the financial and regulatory technologies market (digital financial asset, digital transaction, digital entry, digital transactions register, mining, crypto currency, token, smart contract, etc.). It is noted that the key objectives of the legal regulation should be the minimization of risks for the financial system of the state and national security, as well as replenishment of the revenue side of the budget through taxation of services rendered on the market of financial services and Regtekh, including taxation of operations with crypto currencies and tokens.","[Povetkina, Natalia A.; Ledneva, Yulia, V] Govt Russian Federat, Inst Legislat & Comparat Law, Dept Financial Tax & Budgetary Legislat, 34 Bolshaya Cheremushkinskaya Str, Moscow 117218, Russia","","Povetkina, NA (corresponding author), Govt Russian Federat, Inst Legislat & Comparat Law, Dept Financial Tax & Budgetary Legislat, 34 Bolshaya Cheremushkinskaya Str, Moscow 117218, Russia.","pna127@mail.ru; ulivik@yandex.ru","Povetkina, Natalia/AAG-8109-2021; Ledneva, Yulia/AGZ-6055-2022","","","","","","15","1","6","1","23","NATL RES UNIV HIGHER EDUCATION","MOSCOW","NATL RES UNIV HIGHER EDUCATION, MOSCOW, 00000, RUSSIA","2072-8166","","","PRAVO","Pravo","","2018","","2","","","","","46","67","","10.17323/2072-8166.2018.2.46.67","http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/2072-8166.2018.2.46.67","","","22","Law","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Government & Law","GP0RF","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000440517400003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, in addition to the prediction properties the model producer aims to share, there is also a risk that the model consumer can infer other properties of the training data the model producer did not intend to share. In this paper, we focus on the inference of global properties of the training data, such as the environment in which the data was produced, or the fraction of the data that comes from a certain class, as applied to white-box Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs). Because of their complexity and inscrutability, FCNNs have a particularly high risk of leaking unexpected information about their training sets; at the same time, this complexity makes extracting this information challenging. We develop techniques that reduce this complexity by noting that FCNNs are invariant under permutation of nodes in each layer. We develop our techniques using representations that capture this invariance and simplify the information extraction task. We evaluate our techniques on several synthetic and standard benchmark datasets and show that they are very effective at inferring various data properties. We also perform two case studies to demonstrate the impact of our attack. In the first case study we show that a classifier that recognizes smiling faces also leaks information about the relative attractiveness of the individuals in its training set. In the second case study we show that a classifier that recognizes Bitcoin mining from performance counters also leaks information about whether the classifier was trained on logs from machines that were patched for the Meltdown and Spectre attacks.","[Ganju, Karan; Wang, Qi; Gunter, Carl A.; Borisov, Nikita] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Yang, Wei] Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA","University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas","Ganju, K (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.","kganju2@illinois.edu; qiwang11@illinois.edu; wei.yang@utdallas.edu; cgunter@illinois.edu; nikita@illinois.edu","Wang, Qi/ABC-3689-2021","","NSF [CNS 13-30491, CNS 14-08944]; DOE [0E0000780]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This work was supported in part by NSF CNS 13-30491, NSF CNS 14-08944, and DOE 0E0000780.

With possession of the private key, an attacker virtually owns all of the currency in the compromised wallet. Managing cryptocurrency wallets offline, in isolated ('air-gapped') computers, has been suggested in order to secure the private keys from theft. Such air-gapped wallets are often referred to as 'cold wallets.' In this paper we show how private keys can be exfiltrated from air-gapped wallets. In the adversarial attack model, the attacker infiltrates the offline wallet, infecting it with malicious code. The malware can be preinstalled or pushed in during the initial installation of the wallet, or it can infect the system when removable media (e.g., USB flash drive) is inserted into the wallet's computer in order to sign a transaction. These attack vectors have repeatedly been proven feasible in the last decade (e.g., [1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10]). Having obtained a foothold in the wallet, an attacker can utilize various air-gap covert channel techniques (bridgeware [11]) to jump the air-gap and exfiltrate the wallet's private keys. We evaluate various exfiltration techniques, including physical, electromagnetic, electric, magnetic, acoustic, optical, and thermal techniques. This research shows that although cold wallets provide a high degree of isolation, it's not beyond the capability of motivated attackers to compromise such wallets and steal private keys from them. We demonstrate how a 256-bit private key (e.g., Bitcoin's private keys) can be exfiltrated from an offline, air-gapped wallet of a fictional character named Satoshi within a matter of seconds.","[Guri, Mordechai] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Cyber Secur Res Ctr, Beer Sheva, Israel","Ben Gurion University","Guri, M (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Cyber Secur Res Ctr, Beer Sheva, Israel.","gurim@post.bgu.ac.il","Guri, Mordechai/ABF-4829-2020","","","","","","39","3","4","0","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-7975-3","","","","2018","","","","","","","1308","1316","","10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00227","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00227","","","9","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BN4AE","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000481634500192","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Due to the need of quality assurance and the benefit of better detecting attacks against build environments, the practice of reproducible builds has gained popularity in many open-source software repositories such as Debian and Bitcoin. However, identifying the unreproducible issues remains a labour intensive and time consuming challenge, because of the lacking of information to guide the search and the diversity of the causes that may lead to the unreproducible binaries. In this paper we propose an automated framework called RepLoc to localize the problematic files for unreproducible builds. RepLoc features a query augmentation component that utilizes the information extracted from the build logs, and a heuristic rule-based filtering component that narrows the search scope. By integrating the two components with a weighted file ranking module, RepLoc is able to automatically produce a ranked list of files that are helpful in locating the problematic files for the unreproducible builds. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments over 671 real-world unreproducible Debian packages in four different categories. By considering the topmost ranked file only, RepLoc achieves an accuracy rate of 47.09%. If we expand our examination to the top ten ranked files in the list produced by RepLoc, the accuracy rate becomes 79.28%. Considering that there are hundreds of source code, scripts, Makefiles, etc., in a package, RepLoc significantly reduces the scope of localizing problematic files. Moreover, with the help of RepLoc, we successfully identified and fixed six new unreproducible packages from Debian and Guix.","[Ren, Zhilei; Jiang, He] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Software, Key Lab Ubiquitous Network & Serv Software Liaoni, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Xuan, Jifeng] Wuhan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zijiang] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA","Dalian University of Technology; Wuhan University; Western Michigan University","Ren, ZL (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Software, Key Lab Ubiquitous Network & Serv Software Liaoni, Dalian, Peoples R China.","zren@dlut.edu.cn; jianghe@dlut.edu.cn; jxuan@whu.edu.cn; zijiang.yang@wmich.edu","Xuan, Jifeng/F-2177-2016","Xuan, Jifeng/0000-0002-2968-3496","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61772107, 61722202, 61502345, 61403057]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [DUT16RC(4)62]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This work is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 61772107, 61722202, 61502345, and 61403057, and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant DUT16RC(4)62.","","38","15","17","0","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-4503-5638-1","","","","2018","","","","","","","71","81","","10.1145/3180155.3180224","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3180155.3180224","","","11","Computer Science, Software Engineering","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BL7CS","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000454843300010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

While blockchain has come to be thought of primarily as the foundation for Bitcoin, it has evolved far beyond underpinning the virtual currency. As it becomes progressively popular, the need for effective programming means would be more demanding. Blockchain programming as a core means provides accounts of the 'code is law' that specifies agreements between parties and allows its stakeholders to still trust the platform to execute the agreed-upon contract (known as smart contract) as expected. Although it seems straightforward in theory, it is hardly the case when it comes to real-life situations. There have been several instances that show smart contracts are riddled with issues and vulnerabilities in code, causing damages. What's for sure is lacking is that the existing languages are not living up to the point to be able to unleash the full potential of the blockchain, as often have resulted in buggy code with a steep learning curve for developers. This denotes that the current research on contract development is not sufficient and is still in a stage of infancy. In order to advance the state of the research in this area, an evaluation of the current state-of-the-art practices in a thorough and experimental manner is required. Thus, the objective of this paper is to give a comprehensive analysis of such domain-specific programming practices from critical points of usability and security to provide a working guideline for newcomers and researchers.","[Parizi, Reza M.; Amritraj] Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Software Engn & Game Dev, Kennesaw, GA 30060 USA; [Dehghantanha, Ali] Univ Sheffield, Dept Comp Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England","University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University; University of Sheffield","Parizi, RM (corresponding author), Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Software Engn & Game Dev, Kennesaw, GA 30060 USA.","rparizil@kennesaw.edu; amritra@students.kennesaw.edu; a.dehghantanha@sheffield.ac.uk","Parizi, Reza/AAF-3813-2019","","","","","","35","43","43","0","2","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-319-94478-4; 978-3-319-94477-7","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","10974","","","","","","75","91","","10.1007/978-3-319-94478-4_6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-94478-4_6","","","17","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BQ7CF","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000614362600006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Prior to our work, PoS protocols either required parties to obtain a trusted checkpoint block upon joining and, furthermore, to be frequently online or required an accurate estimate of the number of online parties to be hardcoded into the protocol logic. This ability of new parties to bootstrap from genesis was a hallmark property of the Bitcoin blockchain and was considered an important advantage of PoW-based blockchains over PoS-based blockchains since it facilitates robust operation in a setting with dynamic availability, i.e., the natural setting-without external trusted objects such as checkpoint blocks-where parties come and go arbitrarily, may join at any moment, or remain offline for prolonged periods of time. We prove the security of Ouroboros Genesis against a fully adaptive adversary controlling less than half of the total stake in a partially synchronous network with unknown message delay and unknown, varying levels of party availability. Our security proof is in the Universally Composable setting assuming the most natural abstraction of a hash function, known as the strict Global Random Oracle (ACM-CCS 2014); this highlights an important advantage of PoS blockchains over their PoW counterparts in terms of composability with respect to the hash function formalisation: rather than a strict GRO, PoW-based protocol security requires a local random oracle. Finally, proving the security of our construction against an adaptive adversary requires a novel martingale technique that may be of independent interest in the analysis of blockchain protocols.","[Badertscher, Christian] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Gazi, Peter; Kiayias, Aggelos; Russell, Alexander; Zikas, Vassilis] IOHK, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kiayias, Aggelos; Zikas, Vassilis] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Russell, Alexander] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT USA","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Edinburgh; University of Connecticut","Badertscher, C (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.","badi@inf.ethz.ch; peter.gazi@iohk.io; akiayias@inf.ed.ac.uk; acr@cse.uconn.edu; vzikas@inf.ed.ac.uk","","Russell, Alexander/0000-0002-8228-6238; Badertscher, Christian/0000-0002-1353-1922","NSF [CCF-1717432];  [780477]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ","Partially supported by H2020 Project PRIViLEDGE #780477.; Partially supported by NSF grant CCF-1717432.","","36","48","50","0","1","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","NEW YORK","1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","","","978-1-4503-5693-0","","","","2018","","","","","","","913","930","","10.1145/3243734.3243848","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3243734.3243848","","","18","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BM2QN","","Green Accepted, Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000461315900059","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The fact that a value stream of bits is often traceable, anonymity and protection against double-spending becomes a very difficult task. In physical cash, coins and bills are exchanged physically persons resulting with assured transport of value by the fact that the physical transfer of money assures no possibility for duplication. Block-chaining technique in Bitcoin attempts to prohibit doubling by majority observation with also a limited success in anonymity and double spending issues. We introduce a new concept for E-Coin circulations by prohibiting the knowledge of the coins to any exchanging party. The only one who knows the coins is the minting authority considered as a trusted authority. The coins are made only possible to identify without being able to see them in critical exchange phases by the exchanging parties, thus prohibiting doubling of coins. The key idea of the new concept is to store the coins in unclonable physical Electronic-Wallets (UEW). The coins can be provably transferred without being seen by users. The UEWs can only be used to verify, accommodate and exchange coins only between wallets under the sole control of the users. Users and manufacturers and even Trusted Authorities TAs have no possibilities to clone UEW and duplicate E-coins. The concept is both bio-inspired regarding unclonable entities and physical-cash-inspired as only the minting banks can duplicate coins and bills. The new E-Coin concept is based on using Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) in a new form as digital Secret Unknown Cipher (SUC).","[Mars, Ayoub; Adi, Wael] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, IDA, Inst Comp & Network Engn, Braunschweig, Germany","Braunschweig University of Technology","Mars, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, IDA, Inst Comp & Network Engn, Braunschweig, Germany.","a.mars@tu.bs.de; w.adi@tu-bs.de","","Mars, Ayoub/0000-0002-7478-1255","","","","","33","6","6","0","1","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1939-7003","","978-1-5386-7753-7","NASA ESA CONF","","","2018","","","","","","","333","338","","","","","","6","Engineering, Aerospace; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Computer Science","BM5JA","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000465104900051","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Sophisticated Command and Control (C&C) infrastructures aim to prevent the detection and takedown of botnets and therefore pose a big challenge in the battle against network attacks of all kinds. In this paper, we present ChainChannels, a method for hidden botnet communication that exploits the digital signatures used in blockchains to inject subliminal messages. We show how subliminal messages can be included in signatures and distributed in blockchain transactions to the bots. We also show how the keying material required for extracting the subliminal information can be transmitted privately to the bots while being stored on a public blockchain. As proof of concept, we inject a subliminal message and a key in the Bitcoin blockchain and show how this information can be extracted from the transactions. Our method allows to establish a hidden C&C infrastructure over blockchains and send instructions to all bots without leaving any suspicious communication activities. The method relies only on digital signatures and is therefore applicable to numerous blockchains. The subliminal communication can not be distinguished from legitimate transactions, and mitigation would require redesigning blockchains to use new subliminal-free signature schemes. Our method provides a general hidden distribution channel over blockchains and can be also applied to other scenarios where information needs to be transmitted covertly. It scales extremely well with the number of receivers (i.e., bots), and subliminal messages can even be distributed over different blockchains to exploit specific features of blockchains such as low transaction cost or fast confirmation times or to further obfuscate the existence of the C&C communication.","[Frkat, Davor; Annessi, Robert; Zseby, Tanja] TU Wien, Inst Telecommun, Vienna, Austria","Technische Universitat Wien","Frkat, D (corresponding author), TU Wien, Inst Telecommun, Vienna, Austria.","davor.frkat@tuwien.ac.at; robert.annessi@nt.tuwien.ac.at; tanja.zseby@tuwien.ac.at","","","","","","","26","14","14","0","6","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-7975-3","","","","2018","","","","","","","1244","1252","","10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00219","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00219","","","9","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BN4AE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000481634500184","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Its path-based IOweYou (IOU) settlements across different (crypto)currencies conceptually distinguishes the Ripple blockchain from cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin and altcoins), and makes it highly suitable to an orthogonal yet vast set of applications in the remittance world for cross-border transactions and beyond. This work studies the structure and evolution of the Ripple network since its inception, and investigates its vulnerability to devilry attacks that affect the IOU credit of linnet users' wallets. We find that about 13M USD are at risk in the current Ripple network due to inappropriate configuration of the rippling flag on credit links, facilitating undesired redistribution of credit across those links. Although the Ripple network has grown around a few highly connected hub (gateway) wallets that constitute the core of the network and provide high liquidity to users, such a credit link distribution results in a user base of around 112, 000 wallets that can be financially isolated by as few as 10 highly connected gateway wallets. Indeed, today about 4.9M USD cannot be withdrawn by their owners from the Ripple network due to PayRoutes, a gateway tagged as faulty by the Ripple community. Finally, we observe that stale exchange offers pose a real problem, and exchanges (market makers) have not always been vigilant about periodically updating their exchange offers according to current real-world exchange rates. For example, stale offers were used by 84 Ripple wallets to gain more than 4.5M USD from mid July to mid-August 2017. Our findings should prompt the Ripple community to improve the health of the network by educating its users on increasing their connectivity, and by appropriately maintaining the credit limits, rippling flags, and exchange offers on their IOU credit links.","[Moreno-Sanchez, Pedro; Modi, Navin; Songhela, Raghuvir; Kate, Aniket; Fahmy, Sonia] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus","Moreno-Sanchez, P (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.","pmorenos@purdue.edu; modin@purdue.edu; rsonghel@purdue.edu; aniket@purdue.edu; fahmy@purdue.edu","","Fahmy, Sonia/0000-0003-2870-7166; Moreno-Sanchez, Pedro/0000-0003-2315-7839","National Science Foundation [CNS-1319924, CNS-1717493]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We thank the Ripple forum members and the anonymous reviewers for their feedback.

However, this technology can be practically applied in many areas of the national economy, including oil and gas industry. For example, the blockchain can be useful in solving problems related to the confirming the integrity of primary geological and geophysical data during remote monitoring of the well construction process by excluding the influence of human factor. This technology is referred to as the industrial blockchain and requires consistent encryption and data distribution on storage locations in peer-to-peer network. Any modification of the primary geological and geophysical data in the blockchain system, on any of the computers/equipment in any block, will automatically detected by all participants of the blockchain network. The system of ensuring the integrity and invariability of the received and transmitted data will work as long as at least a single of the network is operated. Hacking such a system is not feasible and cost-effective because the potential attackers have to break through every block, as well as copies of the database on every computer and equipment in the network. This requires a potential attacker to have unique computing resources, which is currently not available. In practice, the reliability of blockchain platforms is confirmed by many years of experience in the bitcoin mining system based on the blockchain principles. The implementation of the blockchain platform in the oil and gas service allowed to ensure and guarantee the reliability of primary geological and geophysical data obtained from wells in real time, to reduce the risks of unauthorized changes.

Companies have been working on many Proof-of-Concepts to find good use cases. To find use cases quickly in the fast-changing environment around Blockchain, companies repeat short-term Proof-of-Concepts many times. There is some work on evaluation methods for Blockchain-based systems like the evaluation form validating the feasibility of Blockchain-based systems with comprehensive evaluation items and prototypes. However, the previous evaluation methods do not satisfy the tight time constraints of Proof-of-Concepts conducted by companies. It takes a long time to define evaluation indices, implement measurement tools and run a series of tests for all evaluation items. It also takes more time to repeat the evaluation to compare multiple Blockchain-based systems using different Blockchain software products. In this paper, we propose a practical screening method for Blockchain-based systems. To reduce time spent on Proof-of-Concepts, the screening phase with a simple check form is introduced before the prototyping phase. Throughout the screening phase, a screening form selects a few Blockchain software products which demonstrate good coverage of requirements for a use case in terms of network topology, settlement finality, governance, privacy/confidentiality and application architecture. After choosing a few promising Blockchain software products, the prototyping phase follows. Prototypes using selected Blockchain software products are evaluated by filling comprehensive evaluation items like the previous methods. The time required for Proof-of-Concepts decreases due to eliminating unpromising Blockchain software products in the screening phase. For the evaluation of the proposed method, we had a case study. The result showed that the estimated workload of a Proof-of-Concept decreased by 59% compared to the previous method.","[Kondo, Yuki; Shimosawa, Taku; Oshima, Satoshi] Hitachi Amer Ltd, Res & Dev Div, Santa Clara, CA 95054 USA","Hitachi Limited","Kondo, Y (corresponding author), Hitachi Amer Ltd, Res & Dev Div, Santa Clara, CA 95054 USA.","yuki.kondo@hal.hitachi.com; taku.shimosawa@hal.hitachi.com; satoshi.oshima@hal.hitachi.com","","","","","","","15","1","1","0","3","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-7975-3","","","","2018","","","","","","","1483","1490","","10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00251","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00251","","","8","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BN4AE","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000481634500216","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A prime application for DAPS is disincentivizing and/or penalizing the creation of two signatures on different payloads within the same address, such as penalizing double spending of transactions in Bitcoin by the loss of the double spender's money. So far DAPS have been constructed from very specific signature schemes not used in practice and using existing techniques it has proved elusive to construct DAPS schemes from signatures widely used in practice. This, unfortunately, has prevented practical adoption of this interesting tool so far. In this paper we ask whether one can construct DAPS from signature schemes used in practice. We affirmatively answer this question by presenting novel techniques to generically construct provably secure DAPS from a large class of discrete logarithm based signatures. This class includes schemes like Schnorr, DSA, EdDSA, and, most interestingly for practical applications, the widely used ECDSA signature scheme. The resulting DAPS are highly efficient and the shortest among all existing DAPS schemes. They are nearly half of the size of the most efficient factoring based schemes (IACR PKC'17) and improve by a factor of 100 over the most efficient discrete logarithm based ones (ACM CCS'15). Although this efficiency comes at the cost of a reduced address space, i.e., size of keys linear in the number of addresses, we will show that this is not a limitation in practice. Moreover, we generalize DAPS to any N > 2, which we denote as N-times-authentication-preventing signatures (NAPS). Finally, we also provide an integration of our ECDSA-based DAPS into the OpenSSL library and perform an extensive comparison with existing approaches.","[Derler, David; Ramacher, Sebastian] Graz Univ Technol, IAIK, Graz, Austria; [Slamanig, Daniel] AIT Austrian Inst Technol, Seibersdorf, Austria","Graz University of Technology; Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT)","Derler, D (corresponding author), Graz Univ Technol, IAIK, Graz, Austria.","david.derler@tugraz.at; sebastian.ramacher@tugraz.at; daniel.slamanig@ait.ac.at","Ramacher, Sebastian/ABH-4334-2020; Slamanig, Daniel/ABC-1084-2021","Ramacher, Sebastian/0000-0003-1957-3725; Slamanig, Daniel/0000-0002-4181-2561; Derler, David/0000-0002-5345-3906","EU [644962]","EU(European Commission)","The authors have been supported by EU H2020 Project PRISMACLOUD, grant agreement n.644962.

Pairs of users leverage these channels to settle payments via a path of intermediaries without the need to record all transactions in a global blockchain. PBT networks such as Bitcoin's Lightning Network and Ethereum's Raiden Network are the most prominent examples of this emergent area of research. Both networks overcome scalability issues of widely used cryptocurrencies by replacing expensive and slow on-chain blockchain operations with inexpensive and fast off-chain transfers. At the core of a decentralized PBT network is a routing algorithm that discovers transaction paths between sender and receiver. In recent years, a number of routing algorithms have been proposed, including landmark routing, utilized in the decentralized IOU credit network SilentWhispers, and Flare, a link state algorithm for the Lightning Network. However, the existing efforts lack either efficiency or privacy, as well as the comprehensive analysis that is indispensable to ensure the success of PBT networks in practice. In this work, we first identify several efficiency concerns in existing routing algorithms for decentralized PBT networks. Armed with this knowledge, we design and evaluate SpeedyMurmurs, a novel routing algorithm for decentralized PBT networks using efficient and flexible embedding-based path discovery and on-demand efficient stabilization to handle the dynamics of a PBT network. Our simulation study, based on real-world data from the currently deployed Ripple credit network, indicates that SpeedyMurmurs reduces the overhead of stabilization by up to two orders of magnitude and the overhead of routing a transaction by more than a factor of two. Furthermore, using SpeedyMurmurs maintains at least the same success ratio as decentralized landmark routing, while providing lower delays. Finally, SpeedyMurmurs achieves key privacy goals for routing in decentralized PBT networks.","[Roos, Stefanie; Goldberg, Ian] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Moreno-Sanchez, Pedro; Kate, Aniket] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","University of Waterloo; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus","Roos, S (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.","sroos@uwaterloo.ca; pmorenos@purdue.edu; aniket@purdue.edu; iang@cs.uwaterloo.ca","","","NSERC [RGPIN-2017-03858]","NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","This work benefited from the use of the CrySP RIPPLE Facility at the University of Waterloo and is partially supported by an Intel/CERIAS RA.

Proof-of-work is the basis of most popular cryptocurrencies and smart contract systems, where participating miners are required to solve difficult mathematical problems to validate transactions. One of the major challenges that proof-of-work faces is the 51% attack, i.e., if an adversary controls more than half of the computation power, he/she can control the blockchain construction and determine which blocks will be included. This is not a major concern when the number of miners is large. However, for an early stage blockchain system with a limited number of users, it is relatively easy for an attacker to launch the 51% attack. To mitigate such risk, we propose a new hybrid blockchain construction scheme that uses the combination of proof-of-work and the stake, which is the number of coins produced by a miner, to determine whether this miner is allowed to construct a block. We prove that stakes play an important role in the hybrid scheme at the beginning, so that an attacker is not able to launch the 51% attack even if he/she controls the majority of the computational power. Meanwhile, the hybrid scheme will converge to pure proof-of-work after sufficiently many blocks are generated, and thus captures the desired properties of proof-of-work. Most importantly, such a convergence is smooth in the sense that neither changes in the rules nor parameters are introduced, and thus no hard/soft-forks will be triggered. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the new scheme using simulations with different configurations, which can help a designer to select adequate parameters for a specific blockchain application.","[Chen, Lin; Xu, Lei; Gao, Zhimin; Lu, Yang; Shi, Weidong] Univ Houston, Comp Sci Dept, Houston, TX 77004 USA","University of Houston System; University of Houston","Chen, L (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Comp Sci Dept, Houston, TX 77004 USA.","chenlin198662@gmail.com; xuleimath@gmail.com; mtion@msn.com; ylu17@central.uh.edu; wshi3@uh.edu","Xu, Lei/J-2095-2019; Chen, Lin/N-4012-2018","Xu, Lei/0000-0002-7662-2119; Chen, Lin/0000-0003-3909-4916","NSF [DGE 1433817]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","Research supported by NSF grant DGE 1433817.","","25","8","9","1","6","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2325-6648","2325-6664","978-1-5386-6553-4","I C DEPENDABLE SYST","","","2018","","","","","","","122","127","","10.1109/DSN-W.2018.00050","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DSN-W.2018.00050","","","6","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BO0ZU","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000494277000038","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The fundamentals of governance are one such paradigm. As society's values have shifted, so have expectations of government shifted from the traditional model to something commonly referred to as 'open governance'. Though a disputed term, we take open governance to mean a concept, which encourages and facilitates openness, accountability, and responsiveness to citizens. For the success of open governance initiatives, there are some technologies, such as the internet, that are crucial. These technologies enable access to both the data and to engagement activities between citizens and government. There are also other technologies, like blockchain and smart contacts, which could be utilised to assist open governance. A sound starting point would be moving from a system where information is tediously released by a government, on an 'as they please' basis, to an infrastructure where critical actions are captured with strong integrity, non-repudiation and evidential guarantees. With an added dimension that facilitates these actions record be accessible to public scrutiny in near real-time. One candidate technology for capturing such actions is blockchain. Initially, blockchains were mainly used to facilitate cryptocurrencies as a record of transactions. The notable example being bitcoin. However, in recent years, blockchains utility is being recognised through smart contracts - potentially a vital building block to realising open and transparent government activities. In this paper, we employ the concept of smart contracts to government tendering activities. The proposed scheme is based on smart contracts, enabling a fair, transparent and independently verifiable (auditable) government tendering scheme. The scheme is then implemented on the Ethereum platform to evaluate the performance and financial cost implications, along with an evaluation of the potential security and auditability challenges.","[Hardwick, Freya Sheer; Akram, Raja Naeem; Markantonakis, Konstantinos] Royal Holloway Univ London, ISG SCC, Egham, Surrey, England","University of London; Royal Holloway University London","Hardwick, FS (corresponding author), Royal Holloway Univ London, ISG SCC, Egham, Surrey, England.","Freya.SheerHardwick.2016@live.rhul.ac.uk; r.n.akram@rhul.ac.uk; k.markantonakis@rhul.ac.uk","Akram, Raja Naeem/N-9162-2013","Akram, Raja Naeem/0000-0002-2789-4628","EPSRC [EP/N028058/1, EP/N028295/1] Funding Source: UKRI","EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","","","9","12","12","0","7","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2324-9013","","978-1-5386-4387-7","IEEE TRUST BIG","","","2018","","","","","","","1342","1347","","10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00185","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00185","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BO1DM","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000495072100176","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Bulletproofs are especially well suited for efficient range proofs on committed values: they enable proving that a committed value is in a range using only 2 log(2) (n) + 9 group and field elements, where n is the bit length of the range. Proof generation and verification times are linear in n. Bulletproofs greatly improve on the linear (in n) sized range proofs in existing proposals for confidential transactions in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, Bulletproofs supports aggregation of range proofs, so that a party can prove that m commitments lie in a given range by providing only an additive Oplogpmqq group elements over the length of a single proof. To aggregate proofs from multiple parties, we enable the parties to generate a single proof without revealing their inputs to each other via a simple multi-party computation (MPC) protocol for constructing Bulletproofs. This MPC protocol uses either a constant number of rounds and linear communication, or a logarithmic number of rounds and logarithmic communication. We show that verification time, while asymptotically linear, is very efficient in practice. The marginal cost of batch verifying 32 aggregated range proofs is less than the cost of verifying 32 ECDSA signatures. Bulletproofs build on the techniques of Bootle et al. (EUROCRYPT 2016). Beyond range proofs, Bulletproofs provide short zero-knowledge proofs for general arithmetic circuits while only relying on the discrete logarithm assumption and without requiring a trusted setup. We discuss many applications that would benefit from Bulletproofs, primarily in the area of cryptocurrencies. The efficiency of Bulletproofs is particularly well suited for the distributed and trustless nature of blockchains.

Web-map applications provide non-typical web content usually visualized by JavaScript code. For such applications, higher-level advanced approaches to quality of service (QoS) assessment are required. In this paper, a method based on the estimation of users' interest in a web page and the information quantity provided by a web page is introduced. In order to implement it, a proof of work (PoW) concept is applied for verification of real users. Moreover, a novel metric is introduced to calculate the information quantity provided by web pages. PoW is used for verification of real users and distinguishing them from bots. Additionally, it can be utilized for balancing of web server load. For monitoring of web pages, an image-based approach is introduced. Web pages are rendered into raster images. A number of metrics describing an image are calculated. This approach allows users to compare and track various web pages, including rich web applications providing complex WebGL content. Several web services utilize the developed solutions.

Each transaction is confirmed by the consensus of a majority of the members, making fraudulent transactions unable to pass collective confirmation. Once a record is created and accepted by the blockchain, it can never be altered or disappear. Nowadays the blockchain technology is considered as the most significant invention after the Internet. If the latter connects people to realize on-line business processes, the former could decide the trust problem by peer-to-peer networking and public-key cryptography.

Furthermore, the large spread of cloud computing and the massive emergence of the software as a service (Saas) paradigm have unveiled many opportunities to combine distinct services, provided by different parties, to establish higher level and more advanced services, that can be offered to end users and enterprises. Business-to-business (B2B) integration and third-party authorization (i.e. using standards like OAuth) are examples of processes requiring more parties to interact with each other to deliver some desired functionality. These kinds of interactions mostly consist of transactions and are usually regulated by some agreement which defines the obligations that involved parties have to comply with. In case one of the parties claims a violation of some clause of such agreement, disputes can occur if the party accused of the infraction refuses to recognize its fault. Moreover, in case of auditing, for convenience reasons a party may deny to have taken part in a given transaction, or may forge historical records related to that transaction. Solutions based on a trusted third party (TTP) have drawbacks: high overhead due to the involvement of an additional party, possible fees to pay for each transaction, and the risks stemming from having to blindly trust another party. If it were possible to only base on transaction logs to sort disputes out, then it would be feasible to get rid of any TTP and related short-comings. In this paper we propose SLAVE, a blockchain-based solution which does not require any TTP. Storing transactions in a public blockchain like Bitcoin's or Ethereum's provides strong guarantees on transactions' integrity, hence they can be actually used as proofs when controversies arise. The solution we propose defines how to embed transaction logs in a public blockchain, so that each involved party can verify the identity of the others while keeping confident the content of transactions.","[Aniello, Leonardo; Baldoni, Roberto; Lombardi, Federico] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Res Ctr Cyber Intelligence & Informat Secur, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn Antonio Ruber, Rome, Italy","Sapienza University Rome","Aniello, L (corresponding author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Res Ctr Cyber Intelligence & Informat Secur, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn Antonio Ruber, Rome, Italy.","aniello@dis.uniroma1.it; baldoni@dis.uniroma1.it; lombardi@dis.uniroma1.it","LOMBARDI, FEDERICO/ABG-2250-2021","LOMBARDI, FEDERICO/0000-0001-6463-8722; ANIELLO, LEONARDO/0000-0003-2886-8445","European Commission's H2020 Programme under the SUNFISH project [644666]","European Commission's H2020 Programme under the SUNFISH project","This work has been supported by the European Commission's H2020 Programme under the SUNFISH project, grant N. 644666.","","11","0","0","0","11","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","2194-5357","2194-5365","978-3-319-70578-1; 978-3-319-70577-4","ADV INTELL SYST","","","2018","717","","","","","","53","58","","10.1007/978-3-319-70578-1_6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-70578-1_6","","","6","Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BK2WF","","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000434086000006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The uniqueness of this type of money is that the transaction occurs only with the approval of a network of participants, and the funds themselves are beyond the control of any state. At the same time, the Russian government, represented by the Ministry of Finance, did not approve a cryptocurrency until 2018. Despite the large number of studies that reveal the main advantages and disadvantages of cryptocurrency, as well as the motivation of the participants, the issue of building trust in cryptocurrencies remains relevant. The main goal of this study is to identify the mechanisms of trust building among the participants of the cryptocurrency market. The research information base was based on 15 semi-structured interviews with active participants of the cryptocurrency market. Based on collected data, a typology of cryptocurrency users was made, and ways of managing risks in interacting with the market and insight into the role of the state in this market were examined. Cryptocurrency users can be divided into those who use it for consumption of various goods (including those who are prohibited in the territory of the Russian Federation) and those who seek to derive financial benefit from the current market situation. Although both groups exist in the same market, they have different expectations: consumers strive to ensure that the cryptocurrency exchange rate remains stable, whereas the other group hopes for a long period of high exchange-rate volatility to increase their own earnings. The position that the local state should take is an important factor of trust for each of the groups represented. Cryptocurrencies are still at an early stage of development. A large group of people on the market is trying to monetize the weaknesses that exist at the moment. Over time, the situation on the cryptocurrency market stabilizes, and it can then move to a qualitatively different stage of development.","[Baranov, Ignat] 2-10 Rudyard St, Melbourne, Vic 3165, Australia","","Baranov, I (corresponding author), 2-10 Rudyard St, Melbourne, Vic 3165, Australia.","Ignatexorby@gmail.com","","","","","","","27","0","2","0","15","NATL RESEARCH UNIV HIGHER SCH ECONOMICS","MOSCOW","SHABOLOVKA, 26, MOSCOW, 119049, RUSSIA","1726-3247","","","J ECON SOCIOL","J.

While most people focus only at cryptocurrencies; in fact, many administrative operations, fintech procedures, and everyday services that can only be done offline and/or in person, can now safely be moved to the Internet as online services. What makes it a powerful tool for digitalizing everyday services is the introduction of smart contracts, as in the Ethereum platform. Smart contracts are meaningful pieces of codes, to be integrated in the blockchain and executed as scheduled in every step of blockchain updates. E-voting on the other hand, is another trending, yet critical, topic related to the online services. The blockchain with the smart contracts, emerges as a good candidate to use in developments of safer, cheaper, more secure, more transparent, and easier-to-use e-voting systems. Ethereum and its network is one of the most suitable ones, due to its consistency, widespread use, and provision of smart contracts logic. An e-voting system must be secure, as it should not allow duplicated votes and be fully transparent, while protecting the privacy of the attendees. In this work, we have implemented and tested a sample e-voting application as a smart contract for the Ethereum network using the Ethereum wallets and the Solidity language. Android platform is also considered to allow voting for people who do not have an Ethereum wallet. After an election is held, eventually, the Ethereum blockchain will hold the records of ballots and votes. Users can submit their votes via an Android device or directly from their Ethereum wallets, and these transaction requests are handled with the consensus of every single Ethereum node. This consensus creates a transparent environment for e-voting. In addition to a broad discussion about reliability and efficiency of the blockchain-based e-voting systems, our application and its test results are presented in this paper, too.","[Koc, Ali Kaan; Yavuz, Emre; Dalkilic, Gokhan] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Comp Engn Dept, Izmir, Turkey; [Cabuk, Umut Can] Erzincan Univ, Elect Elect Engn Dept, Erzincan, Turkey","Dokuz Eylul University; Erzincan Binali Yildirim University","Koc, AK (corresponding author), Dokuz Eylul Univ, Comp Engn Dept, Izmir, Turkey.","kaan.koc@ceng.deu.edu.tr; emre.yavuz@ceng.deu.edu.tr; ucabuk@erzincan.edu.tr; dalkilic@cs.deu.edu.tr","Sánchez-Gómez, Nicolás/K-3758-2014; Dalkılıç, Gökhan/B-8292-2014; Çabuk, Umut Can/AAF-7644-2019","Dalkılıç, Gökhan/0000-0002-0130-1716; Çabuk, Umut Can/0000-0002-5166-4670","Ericsson Arastirma Gelistirme ve Bilisim Hizmetleri AS","Ericsson Arastirma Gelistirme ve Bilisim Hizmetleri AS(Ericsson)","This study is a part of a broader research related to e-voting systems, conducted by the Security Research Group at Dokuz Eylul University Computer Engineering Department, and has been supported by Ericsson Arastirma Gelistirme ve Bilisim Hizmetleri AS.","","13","52","53","1","14","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-3449-3","","","","2018","","","","","","","143","148","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BK2YG","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000434247400027","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The original motivation for such proofs included non-interactive time-stamping and universally verifiable CPU benchmarks. A more recent application, and our main motivation, are blockchain designs, where proofs of sequential work can be used - in combination with proofs of space - as a more ecological and economical substitute for proofs of work which are currently used to secure Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The construction proposed by [MMV13] is based on a hash function and can be proven secure in the random oracle model, or assuming inherently sequential hash-functions, which is a new standard model assumption introduced in their work. In a proof of sequential work, a prover gets a statement., a time parameter N and access to a hash-function H, which for the security proof is modelled as a random oracle. Correctness requires that an honest prover can make a verifier accept making only N queries to H, while soundness requires that any prover who makes the verifier accept must have made (almost) N sequential queries to H. Thus a solution constitutes a proof that N time passed since. was received. Solutions must be publicly verifiable in time at most polylogarithmic in N. The construction of [MMV13] is based on depth-robust graphs, and as a consequence has rather poor concrete parameters. But the major drawback is that the prover needs not just N time, but also N space to compute a proof. In this work we propose a proof of sequential work which is much simpler, more efficient and achieves much better concrete bounds. Most importantly, the space required can be as small as log(N) (but we get better soundness using slightly more memory than that). An open problem stated by [MMV13] that our construction does not solve either is achieving a unique proof, where even a cheating prover can only generate a single accepting proof. This property would be extremely useful for applications to blockchains.","[Cohen, Bram] Chia Network, San Francisco, CA 94104 USA; [Pietrzak, Krzysztof] IST Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria","Institute of Science & Technology - Austria","Cohen, B (corresponding author), Chia Network, San Francisco, CA 94104 USA.","bram@chia.network; pietrzak@ist.ac.at","","","European Research Council (ERC) [682815 -TOCNeT]","European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC))","K.

Using the method of scenario analysis, the authors consider four possible options for long-term development of the world monetary and financial system. Their implementation depends on prevailing expectations in the society regarding the strengthening or weakening of regulation of monetary relations, the concentration or dispersion of control over monetary authorities. The first scenario supranational money involves the introduction of a global reserve currency operated beyond the jurisdiction of any particular country. This scenario is based on the transformation of the IMF into a bank of central banks, conversion of SDRs into a systemic standard of value, introduction of symmetric rights and obligations between creditors and debtors to finance payment imbalances, transition to real rather than nominal fixed exchange rates, re-direction of virtual capital flows to priority service of real sector of the economy, creating a liquid market for SDR-denominated bonds. The analysis of viability of gold re-monetization scenario stems from comparison of the views of leading American economists on the prospects of restoring various forms of the gold standard - from the classical one with reestablishing of the monetary functions of gold to the quasi-golden variant realized through a 100% bank reserve system. In monetary polycentrism scenario the attention is drawn to the fact that introduction of the Euro failed to ensure financial sovereignty of the member countries of the Eurozone and to prevent economic destabilization of the European economic and monetary union. It is emphasized that the federalization of Europe in the banking, budgetary, fiscal and political spheres as well as intensive internationalization of Renminbi could serve as the basis for creating real alternatives to US dollar hegemony in the world, followed by the formation of currency blocks in Eurasia with the participation of Russia and China. In digital currency scenario the authors develop the hypothesis of using crypto currency (bitcoin and its analogues) for expanding the virtual market space in order to form a global financial cybernetic system that is not controlled by state organizations and transnational corporations. The authors come to the conclusion that Russia needs to seriously prepare for implementation of all analyzed scenarios while relying on its own historic experience in creating alternative international trading and monetary system.","[Zvonova, Elena A.; Kuznetsov, Aleksei V.] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, 49 Leningradskii Prosp, Moscow 125993, Russia","Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation","Zvonova, EA (corresponding author), Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, 49 Leningradskii Prosp, Moscow 125993, Russia.","zvonovaelena7@mail.ru; kuznetsov0572@mail.ru","Kuznetsov, Aleksey/K-8584-2016","Kuznetsov, Aleksey/0000-0003-3669-0667","Government of the Russian Federation [gz-29-17]","Government of the Russian Federation","The study was supported by the Government of the Russian Federation (state registration no. gz-29-17 Development of a model for sectoral development of financial market of the Russian Federation under current transformation of world monetary and financial system).","","29","2","4","3","26","NAUKA PUBLISHING HOUSE","MOSCOW","PROFSOYUZNAYA UL 90, MOSCOW, 117864, RUSSIA","0131-2227","","","MIROVAYA EKON MEZHD","Mirovaya Ekon.

Such transactions are in contrast to traditional transactions, where typically two parties to a transaction are the only ones with information about the transaction. For example, in a sale, the seller and the purchaser typically are the only ones with information about the transaction. However, some emerging technologies, such as blockchain accounting, supply chain social media, and hashtag commerce are making information about the transactions potentially openly available to others. This paper investigates some of the implications and strategies that include the use of that open information. For example, open information in accounting and supply chain transactions provides the potential for both business intelligence analysis of the information and possibly misleading and illusory transactions, analogous to those that have garnered the recent attention of the Justice Department in cryptocurrencies. Finally, this paper suggests that blockchain transaction processing will provide reliable information in those settings where there is a single truth feed of information flow for the phenomena of interest, no ability to do off-blockchain transactions (or a large penalty cost) and limitation to a single identity for each enterprise on the blockchain.","[O'Leary, Daniel E.] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA USA","University of Southern California","O'Leary, DE (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Marshall Sch Business, 3660 Trousdale Pkwy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.","oleary@usc.edu","O'Leary, Daniel E/B-6469-2008","O'Leary, Daniel Edmund/0000-0002-5240-9516","","","","","31","20","21","2","52","JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD","CHICHESTER","THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND","1055-615X","1099-1174","","INTELL SYST ACCOUNT","Intell.

We agreed the terminology of cover text and stego text against a background of the game proposed by our keynote speaker Gus Simmons: that Alice and Bob are in jail and wish to hatch an escape plan without the fact of their communication coming to the attention of the warden, Willie. Since then there have been significant strides in developing technical mechanisms for steganography and steganalysis, with new techniques from machine learning providing ever more powerful tools for the analyst, such as the ensemble classifier. There have also been a number of conceptual advances, such as the square root law and effective key length. But there always remains the question whether we are using the right security metrics for the application. In this talk I plan to take a step backwards and look at the systems context. When can stegosystems actually be used? The deployment history is patchy, with one being Trucrypt's hidden volumes, inspired by the steganographic file system. Image forensics also find some use, and may be helpful against some adversarial machine learning attacks (or at least help us understand them). But there are other contexts in which patterns of activity have to be hidden for that activity to be effective. I will discuss a number of examples starting with deception mechanisms such as honeypots, Tor bridges and pluggable transports, which merely have to evade detection for a while; then moving on to the more challenging task of designing deniability mechanisms, from leaking secrets to a newspaper through bitcoin mixes, which have to withstand forensic examination once the participants come under suspicion. We already know that, at the system level, anonymity is hard. However the increasing quantity and richness of the data available to opponents may move a number of applications from the deception category to that of deniability. To pick up on our model of 20 years ago, Willie might not just put Alice and Bob in solitary confinement if he finds them communicating, but torture them or even execute them. Changing threat models are historically one of the great disruptive forces in security engineering. This leads me to suspect that a useful research area may be the intersection of deception and forensics, and how information hiding systems can be designed in anticipation of richer and more complex threat models.

Since the advent of spam filters and black-lists, where users and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) prevented most PPI providers from delivering advertisements legitimately, an underground economy has evolved using the PPI business model to promote Exploit as a Service (EaaS) and Malware as a Service (MaaS) [Paganini 2013]. To prevent detection of their activities EaaS and MaaS providers use multiple anonymous proxy and onion services, multiple tiers of security to mask one layer of their business from other layers, and additional obfuscation techniques to thwart law enforcement agencies. Monitoring financial transactions has been a major weapon for law enforcement and government agencies, which collaborate with corporations to provide financial data for suspect currency transactions. To counter this capability and prevent detection of financial transactions, cyber criminals have adopted crypto currencies as a secure means to pay clients or receive payments while masking their transactions, identity and avoid taxes. Since the initial occurrence of crypto currency in 2009 (BITCOIN), over 100 crypto currency exchanges now exist, hosting 1147 unique crypto coins ranging from $<1USD to >$11,000 USD in monetary value [Crypto-Currency, 2017]. Many on-line stores now accept crypto-coins and crypto currency banks have been established to anonymously store specific types of crypto coins. Government and law enforcement agencies, such as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network [Drandreagalli 2013] are ill equipped to track and act upon crypto transactions in the same manner they are able to monitor and track government-sponsored currencies. A crackdown by the US government on a virtual currency reserve was not supported by other countries to include Great Britain, which released a statement to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) stating, not everyone involved (in crypto currency) is shady or involved in criminal activity-principally those outside the United States. This international rift in fiscal policies are mirrored by US agencies, as legitimacy for crypto currency is gaining traction from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other US government organizations; facilitating the ability of legitimate businesses to accept crypto currency for payment of goods and services. The intent of this research is to demonstrate the transition from government currencies to crypto currencies for purchase and redistribution of EaaS and MaaS activities, creating greater competition and reducing prices through an anonymous transaction process. The authors will provide an explanation of crypto currency, how it is produced, currency distribution, and the ability to conduct anonymous transactions across borders and legal jurisdictions. The authors will present a case study which creates and exchanges crypto currency with minimal risk of detection while engaging in MaaS and EaaS transactions.","[Rohret, David; Vella, Michael] CSRA Inc, FIERCE Labs, San Antonio, TX 78217 USA","","Rohret, D (corresponding author), CSRA Inc, FIERCE Labs, San Antonio, TX 78217 USA.","david.rohret@csra.com; michael.vella@csra.com","","","","","","","5","0","0","1","5","ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD","NR READING","CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND","2048-9870","2048-9889","978-1-911218-73-9","INT C CYBER WARFARE","","","2018","","","","","","","645","650","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Information Systems","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP6NH","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000560053500077","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Numerous cities around the world are launching blockchain initiatives as part of the overall efforts toward shaping the urban future. However, the infancy stage of the blockchain industry leads to a severe gap between the knowledge we have and the actions urban policy makers are taking. This paper is an effort to narrow this rift. We provide a systematic literature review on concrete blockchain use cases proposed by the research community. At the macro-level, we discuss and organize use cases from 159 selected papers into nine sectors recognized as crucial for sustainable and smart urban future. At the micro-level, we identify a component-based framework and analyze the design and prototypes of blockchain systems studied in a subset of 71 papers. The high-level use case review allows us to illustrate the relationship between them and the four pillars of urban sustainability: social, economic, environmental, and governmental. The system level analysis helps us highlight interesting inconsistencies between well-known blockchain applicability decision rules and the approaches taken by the literature. We also offer two classification methodologies for blockchain use cases and elaborate on how they can be applied to stimulate cross-sector insights in the blockchain knowledge domain.","[Shen, Charles] Columbia Univ, Adv Construct & Informat Technol Lab, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Pena-Mora, Feniosky] Columbia Univ, Ctr Bldg Infrastruct & Publ Space, New York, NY 10027 USA","Columbia University; Columbia University","Shen, C (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Adv Construct & Informat Technol Lab, New York, NY 10027 USA.","charles.shen@columbia.edu","Sánchez-Gómez, Nicolás/K-3758-2014","","Kong Family and Zhao Family Gifts","Kong Family and Zhao Family Gifts","This work was supported by the Kong Family and Zhao Family Gifts.","","263","71","74","7","73","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2018","6","","","","","","76787","76819","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2880744","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2880744","","","33","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","HF5WN","","Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000454305000001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Consistent with the existing literature, first, I find that monetary equilibrium under a purely private arrangement of digital currencies will not deliver a socially efficient allocation. Second, I place restrictions on the available supply of digital currencies and find that a socially efficient allocation is possible only if the upper bound on digital currency circulation is equal to the rate of time-preference, albeit some degree of government intervention is required to curb the profit-maximizing incentive of the miners. Third, I find that optimal monetary policy at the Friedman rule will be socially inefficient when digital currencies compete with government-issued fiat money. Finally, I show that the Friedman rule is a socially desirable policy only in a purely fiat monetary regime. (C) 2018 University of Venice. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Consensus protocol is the core mechanism of a blockchain network that securely maintains the distributed ledger from possible attacks from adversaries. Proof-of-work (PoW) is a commonly used consensus protocol that requires a significant amount of computation to find a new valid block. As the application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that are specially designed for PoW computation begin to dominate blockchain consensus operation, the decentralized nature of blockchain networks is being threatened. Many PoW mechanisms are being proposed to disincentivize the use of ASICs in the consensus operation. Employing multiple hash functions in the PoW computation (i.e., multi-hash PoW) is one of the commonly adopted approaches to achieve such ASIC-resistance. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the level of ASIC-resistance of the multi-hash PoW mechanisms. We assess the level of ASIC-resistance based on the performance gap between ASICs and general-purpose computing platforms. Contrary to the expectation of the multi-hash PoW mechanisms, our results reveal that ASIC-resistance of these PoW mechanisms is not strong enough to prevent ASIC-based mining. Most of them show similar levels of ASIC-resistance as those of PoW mechanisms that are already defeated by ASIC-based systems.","[Cho, Hyungmin] Hongik Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Seoul 04066, South Korea","Hongik University","Cho, H (corresponding author), Hongik Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Seoul 04066, South Korea.","hcho@hongik.ac.kr","","","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government-Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP) [2017017414]","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government-Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP)","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government-Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP)-under Grant 2017017414.","","48","33","34","3","16","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2018","6","","","","","","66210","66222","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2878895","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2878895","","","13","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","HD3ID","","gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000452407900001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

By differentiating tokens based on their functional attributes, cryptocurrency tokens can be categorised into crypto-transaction tokens (which act as a cash substitute); crypto-fuel tokens (which underpin generic blockchain applications); and crypto-voucher tokens (which can be exchanged for a predefined asset). This classification is applied to identify important issues when considering whether to participate in a cryptocurrency system, such as the impact of potential forks, token supply expectations and the level of dependence on a few operators (entity-dependence). For crypto-transaction tokens (and crypto-fuel tokens if used in a similar or overlapping role) it shows the importance of the token being seen as a better form of money. For crypto-fuel tokens, the popularity of blockchain applications and the utility of the crypto-fuel system in application development is vital. For crypto-voucher tokens, the value of the underlying asset, the token's exchangeability for that asset and the importance of a digital representation should be considered by participants.

However, data and trust management still remain two challenges for current detection architectures, which may degrade the effectiveness of such detection systems. In recent years, blockchain technology has shown its adaptability in many fields, such as supply chain management, international payment, interbanking, and so on. As blockchain can protect the integrity of data storage and ensure process transparency, it has a potential to be applied to intrusion detection domain.

As a result, many attacking strategies are proposed to maximize pools' reward. Very recently, Kwon et. al. proposed Fork After Withholding (FAW) attack by combining selfish mining and Block Withholding (BWH) attack, which, as they stated, has a better reward than BWH. However, it is not always the case after our further investigation. In this paper, we firstly give a detailed comparation between the BWH and FAW attack, and show the implications behind them. We also consider honest mining to make the analysis of the block reward more clear. We demonstrate the imperfection of FAW in relative reward, reward after the fork and the fork state. Our main finding for FAW attack includes that the reward of victim pool increases faster compared to BWH attack, and for some cases, the attack should adopt honest mining strategy to maximize its reward, therefore, we present an improved FAW strategy, and propose a protocol for the pool's manager to resist FAW's attacker. Finally, we discuss the underlying flaws of FAW attack as well as countermeasures to alleviate it.","[Ke, Junming; Jiang, Han; Song, Xiangfu; Zhao, Shengnan; Xu, Qiuliang] Shandong Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Jinan 250000, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Han; Xu, Qiuliang] Shandong Univ, Sch Software, Jinan 250000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hao] Shandong Normal Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Jinan 250000, Peoples R China","Shandong University; Shandong University; Shandong Normal University","Jiang, H (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Jinan 250000, Peoples R China.;Jiang, H (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Sch Software, Jinan 250000, Peoples R China.","junmingke1994@gmail.com; jianghan@sdu.edu.cn; wangha@sdnu.edu.cn; xql@sdu.edu.cn","","zhao, shengnan/0000-0001-6883-9724","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61572294, 61602287]; Key Program of National Natural Science of China [61632020]; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2017MF021]; Primary Research & Development Plan of Shandong Province [2018GGX101037]; Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University [2017JC019]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Program of National Natural Science of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Primary Research & Development Plan of Shandong Province; Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant No. 61572294, No. 61602287, Key Program of National Natural Science of China under grant No. 61632020, Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province under grant No. ZR2017MF021, the Primary Research & Development Plan of Shandong Province (No. 2018GGX101037), and the Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University under grant No. 2017JC019.","","14","3","3","0","0","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0302-9743","1611-3349","978-3-030-02744-5; 978-3-030-02743-8","LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","","","2018","11058","","","","","","16","31","","10.1007/978-3-030-02744-5_2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-02744-5_2","","","16","Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Mathematics","BS3YC","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000716930800002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

So far, a lot of researches and analyses have focused on just one or only a few number of cryptocurrencies, a comprehensive analysis of the whole cryptocurrency market and its systemic risk is still lacking. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics and systemic risk of the cryptocurrency market based on the public available price history. We first validated that the correlation matrix and asset tree are good tools to analyze the risk and stability of the cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, consistent with public perception, our quantitative analysis reveals that the cryptocurrency market is relatively fragile and unstable. Our work is the first to investigate the systemic risk of the whole cryptocurrency market and may shed some light on cryptocurrency related investment decision, regulation, and legislation.","[Liang, Jiaqi; Li, Linjing; Zeng, Daniel] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, State Key Lab Management & Control Complex Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liang, Jiaqi; Zeng, Daniel] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Comp & Control Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yunwei] CNCERT CC, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Automation, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Liang, JQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, State Key Lab Management & Control Complex Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Liang, JQ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Comp & Control Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.","liangjiaqi2014@ia.ac.cn; linjing.li@ia.ac.cn; dajun.zeng@ia.ac.cn; zhaoyw@cert.org.cn","","Liang, Jiaqi/0000-0003-4977-4093","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0820105, 2016QY02D0305]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71702181, 71621002, U1435221]; Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [ZDRW-XH-2017-3]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences)","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFC0820105 and 2016QY02D0305, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 71702181, 71621002, and U1435221, as well as the Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences under Grant ZDRW-XH-2017-3.","","35","7","7","0","11","IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","","","978-1-5386-7848-0","","","","2018","","","","","","","43","48","","","","","","6","Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BM0AF","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000458546800008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It is impossible to uniquely define the term cryptocurrency. The English language dictionary Meriam Webster defines it as any form of currency that only exists digitally, that usually has no central issuing or regulating authority but instead uses a decentralized system to record transactions and manage the issuance of new units, and that relies on cryptography to prevent counterfeiting and fraudulent transactions(1). This definition also corresponds to the proclaimed intention of the creators of this new technology. Although there have been earlier, less successful attempts, it is generally accepted that the chronologically first commercially available cryptocurrencybitcoin, was released on the market in early 2009(2). Its mysterious author, Satoshi Nakamoto (for which many believe is the pseudonym behind the entire team of software engineers(3)) published in 2008, a paper laying out the basics of future technology of crypto currencies and their purpose(4). The paper explains that bitcoin is a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution such as bank. The problem of transaction recording and the prevention of multiple use of the same assets is solved by the introduction of block chain technology, a kind of digital accounting chain in which each transaction and each issue is entered cryptographically. It is decentralized and set up so that the processor work (a series of complex mathematical operations performed by different types of microprocessors) required for a digital coin to be forged is inevitably equal to the work required for issuance of each new coin. In this way, the crypto currency becomes essentially resistant to forgery in the form of a false issuance, and the dynamics of its issuance is determined by the complexity of the mathematical problems that are being solved. The chain is also definitely limited, since the number of issued coins is halved every four years, so the total number of issuable bitcoins is mathematically limited to 21 000 0005, which gives the cryptocurrency a self-defined deflationary(6)(or anti-inflationary(7)) framework. It is estimated that the last bit of the coin will be broadcast in 2140(8). The advantages of the cryptocurrencies are numerous. From the privacy and security of transactions, to general global availability, which is of particular importance in a world where about 30% of the population has no access to financial services(9), while Internet access (as the only technical requirement for the use of crypto currencies) is considerably more widespread. Advantages are inevitably accompanied by disadvantages, and in the case of cryptocurrencies, they are not few in number. They relate primarily to the possibility of misuse of a wide range of criminal activities, from money laundering to the pursuit of illegal transactions, arms, narcotics(10), and human trafficking(11). Lately, there has also been a risk of investment fraud related to the opening of crypto funds, to which, among other things, warns the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission(12). All this leads to the need to formulate a regulatory framework for digital cash, ie, cryptocurrencies. It is a challenge that is closely followed and interwoven with the problem of their substantive definition, because all the cryptocurrencies are partly, and as we see many entirely, go out of the reduced framework of the digital global substitute of national currencies.","[Zelic, Dragan] Avocat Barreau Geneve, Geneva, Switzerland; [Baros, Nenad] Univ Banja Luka, Fac Econ, Banja Luka, Bosnia & Herceg","University of Banja Luka (UNIBL)","Zelic, D (corresponding author), Avocat Barreau Geneve, Geneva, Switzerland.","dragan.zeljic@zegal.ch; nenad.baros@ef.unibl.org","","","","","","","1","2","2","2","10","VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY","VARAZDIN","MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA","1849-6903","1849-7535","","EC SOC DEVELOP","","","2018","","","","","","","168","176","","","","","","9","Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","Business & Economics; Development Studies","BP1SK","","","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000540733700020","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The major problems with data today are its security and management, more importantly access control. These factors when not tackled effectively can lead to many compromises. The blockchain is an effective technology that ensures utmost security, trust, and maximum access control in big data systems. However, almost all the transactions on a blockchain network are stored in the platform. This process reduces the data storage, as the storage of all transactions sometimes creates unnecessary overheads. In this paper, an off-chain-based sovereign blockchain is proposed, where a virtual container is created for parties to transact in. At the end of a transaction, and satisfying each party, the container is destroyed but the results are stored on the sovereign blockchain network. This effectively decreases the amount of data that would have been stored on the network. The effectiveness of our system is compared with other schemes, and we could infer that our proposed system outperforms the already-existing ones.","[Sifah, Emmanuel Boateng; Agyekum, Kwame Opuni-Boachie Obour; Amofa, Sandro] UESTC, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Xia, Qi] UESTC, Ctr Cyber Secur, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Gao, Jianbin] UESTC, Sch Resource & Environm, Ctr Digital Hlth, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ruidong; Xia, Hu] Youe Data Co Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gee, James C.] Univ Penn, Dept Radiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Gee, James C.] UESTC, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Du, Xiaojiang] Temple Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Guizani, Mohsen] Univ Idaho, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; University of Pennsylvania; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Idaho; University of Idaho","Xia, Q (corresponding author), UESTC, Ctr Cyber Secur, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.","emmanuelsifah@yahoo.com; xiaqi0769@gmail.com; obour539@yahoo.com; ikwame.amofa@gmail.com; gaojb@uestc.edu.cn; crdchen@163.com; Xiahu@youedata.com; gee@uestc.edu.cn; dxj@ieee.org; mguizani@ieee.org","Guizani, Mohsen/AAX-4534-2021; Agyekum, Kwame Opuni-Boachie Obour/AAA-1828-2020","Guizani, Mohsen/0000-0002-8972-8094; Gao, Jianbin/0000-0001-7014-6417","applied basic research programs of Sichuan Province [2015JY0043]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [ZYGX2015J154, ZYGX2016J152, ZYGX2016J170]; programs of international science and technology cooperation and exchange of Sichuan Province [2017HH0028]; Key research and development projects of high and new technology development and industrialization of Sichuan Province [2017GZ0007]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016QY04WW0802, 2016QY04W0800, 2016QY04W0803]; National Engineering Laboratory","applied basic research programs of Sichuan Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); programs of international science and technology cooperation and exchange of Sichuan Province; Key research and development projects of high and new technology development and industrialization of Sichuan Province; National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Engineering Laboratory","This work is supported in part by the applied basic research programs of Sichuan Province (2015JY0043), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (ZYGX2015J154, ZYGX2016J152, ZYGX2016J170), programs of international science and technology cooperation and exchange of Sichuan Province (2017HH0028), Key research and development projects of high and new technology development and industrialization of Sichuan Province (2017GZ0007).

The heuristic algorithm, differential evolution, has been advocated as a powerful tool in portfolio optimization. We propose in this study two new approaches derived from the traditional differential evolution (DE) method: the GARCH-differential evolution (GARCH-DE) and the GARCH-differential evolution t-copula (GARCH-DE-t-copula). We then contrast these two models with DE (benchmark) in single and multi-period optimizations on a portfolio consisting of five cryptoassets under the coherent risk measure CVaR constraint. Our analysis shows that the GARCH-DE-t-copula outperforms the DE and GARCH-DE approaches in both single- and multi-period frameworks. For these notoriously volatile assets, the GARCH-DE-t-copula has shown risk-control ability, hereby confirming the ability of t-copula to capture the dependence structure in the fat tail.","[Mba, Jules Clement; Koumba, Ur] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Pure & Appl Math, POB 524, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa; [Pindza, Edson] Univ Pretoria, Dept Math & Appl Math, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Pindza, Edson] Achieversklub Sch Cryptocurrency & Entrepreneursh, 1 Sturdee Ave, ZA-2196 Johannesburg, South Africa","University of Johannesburg; University of Pretoria","Mba, JC (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Dept Pure & Appl Math, POB 524, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa.","jmba@uj.ac.za; edsonpindza@gmail.com; koumba_ur@yahoo.fr","Clement, Jules/AAE-3546-2021; Koumba, Ur/AAD-6269-2020","Mba, Jules Clement/0000-0001-6462-6385; Pindza, Edson/0000-0003-3207-8067","","","","","38","11","11","1","10","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1934-4554","2373-8529","","FINANC MARK PORTFOLI","Financ.

Especially the great fluctuations in price have attracted such attention. Behavioral sciences and related scientific literature provide evidence that there is a close relationship between social media and price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies. This particularly applies to smaller currencies, which can be substantially influenced by references on Twitter. Although these so-called altcoins often have smaller trading volumes they sometimes attract large attention on social media. Here, we show that fluctuations in altcoins can be predicted from social media. In order to do this, we collected a dataset containing prices and the social media activity of 181 altcoins in the form of 426,520 tweets over a timeframe of 71 days. The containing public mood was then estimated using sentiment analysis. To predict altcoin returns, we carried out linear regression analyses based on 45 days of data. We showed that short-term returns can be predicted from activity and sentiments on Twitter.","[Steinert, Lars; Herff, Christian] Univ Bremen, Cognit Syst Lab, Bremen, Germany","University of Bremen","Steinert, L (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Cognit Syst Lab, Bremen, Germany.","lars.steinert@uni-bremen.de","","Herff, Christian/0000-0002-5610-2618","Klaus Tschira Stiftung; Klaus Tschira Foundation","Klaus Tschira Stiftung; Klaus Tschira Foundation","Lars Steinert receives a scholarship by the Klaus Tschira Stiftung (https://www.klaustschira-stiftung.de/).The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.; This work was partially funded by the Klaus Tschira Foundation.","","50","9","9","2","11","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","DEC 4","2018","13","12","","","","","","","e0208119","10.1371/journal.pone.0208119","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0208119","","","12","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","HD0NQ","30513110","Green Submitted, Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000452204800024","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The purpose of this paper is to identify and analyze various critical success factors (CSFs) that can facilitate success of blockchain-based cloud services. Further, this paper aims to analyze and understand mutual interactions among these CSFs. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, 19 CSFs have been identified through literature review and expert opinions. The hierarchical framework developed using total interpretive structural modeling has revealed the inter-dependencies among these CSFs. The methodology employed in this study provides a mechanism to conduct an exploratory study by identifying the factors and analyzing their interactions through the development of a hierarchical framework. This research further categorizes CSFs into multiple clusters based on their driving power and dependence power. Findings This paper has identified 19 CSFs, namely, user engagement, industry collaboration, rich ecosystem, blockchain technology standardization, regulatory clarity, cost efficiency, energy efficiency (wasted resources), handling blockchain bloat, miner incentives, business case alignment to blockchain capability, sidechains development, blockchain talent pool availability, leadership readiness for a decentralized consensus based technology, technology investment and maturity, trust on blockchain networks, integration with other cloud services, robust and mature smart contracts platform, blockchain security and user control on data (privacy). Further, driver and dependent variables have been identified. Research limitations/implications Future research can discover and detail the sub-factors behind the 19 CSFs identified in this paper. Additionally, more work can be done to extend the current structural model for blockchain-based services to a more functional form. Practical implications It provides a comprehensive list of CSFs that are relevant for development of blockchain-based cloud services. This will help industry leaders to strategically focus on the main drivers that will ensure that businesses get maximum benefit of this disruptive technology. Originality/value This study makes a significant contribution in the literature of blockchain-based cloud services, which captures the perspective of different stakeholders. This study is one of the first (if not the first) systematic research on adoption of blockchain-based services. It creates the foundation to carry out further research in this area.","[Prasad, Sanjay; Roy, Sreejit] IBM India Pvt Ltd, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Shankar, Ravi] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Management Studies, New Delhi, India; [Gupta, Rachita] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, New Delhi, India","International Business Machines (IBM); Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi","Prasad, S (corresponding author), IBM India Pvt Ltd, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.","skprasad@gmail.com; r.s.research@gmail.com; rachitagupta1987@gmail.com; sreejit.roy@in.ibm.com","Sánchez-Gómez, Nicolás/K-3758-2014; Gupta, Rachita/AAE-5406-2022","SHANKAR, RAVI/0000-0001-8724-593X","","","","","67","46","46","7","59","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","0972-7981","2049-3207","","J ADV MANAG RES","J.

Different from major stock indices and the commodities of gold and crude oil, the cryptocurrencies exhibit some characteristics of immature market assets, such as auto-correlated and non-stationary return series, higher volatility, and higher tail risks measured by conditional Value at Risk (VaR) and conditional expected shortfall (ES). Using an extreme-value-theory-based method, we evaluate the extreme characteristics of seven representative cryptocurrencies during 08 August 2015-01 August 2017. We find that during the sub-period of 01 August 2016-01 August 2017, there are finite loss boundaries for most of the selected cryptocurrencies, which are similar to the commodities, and different from the stock indices. Meanwhile, we find that left tail correlations are much stronger than right tail correlations among the cryptocurrencies, and tail correlations increased after August 2016, suggesting high and growing systematic extreme risks. We also find that cryptocurrencies to be both left tail independent, and cross tail independent with four selected stock indices, which implies part of the safe-haven function of the cryptocurrencies, indicating their ability to be a great diversifier for the stock market as gold, but not enough to be a tail hedging tool like gold.","[Feng, Wenjun; Wang, Yiming] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhengjun] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Stat, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Peking University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison","Wang, YM (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.","wangyiming@pku.edu.cn","Feng, Wenjun/AAB-2842-2020","","China Scholarship Council [201606010147]; Division of Mathematical Sciences [1505367]","China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Division of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS))","This work was supported by the China Scholarship Council [Grant number 201606010147] and Division of Mathematical Sciences [Grant number 1505367].","","40","73","74","5","35","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0003-6846","1466-4283","","APPL ECON","Appl.

To solve this problem, in this paper we proposed a blockchain-based scheme for digital rights management(named DRMChain), which supports the right content serves the right users in a right way, the DRMChain can provide trusted and high-level credible content protection and conditional traceability of violation content service. In the proposed DRMChain, we use two isolated blockchain application interfaces (BAI) to respectively store plain and cipher summary information of original and DRM-protected digital content, and considering large capacity of digital content such as image, audio or video, we proposed external flexible storage of plain/cipher digital content and creates hashlD of the content itself and links with the blockchain. In DRMChain scheme, we named the BAI plain interface as BAIP for summary metadata storage of original content, and the BAI cipher interface as BAIC for DRMprotected content service. In the DRMChain scheme we proposed efficient and secure authentication, privacy protection and multi-signature-based conditional traceability approaches, and thus the DRM license, usage control and constrain information can be easily retrieved form the blockchain, and customs can query all the consumption transaction lists of free or paid consumption history to prevent baleful fee-deduction.

E-commerce carried out through social networks expands its application to a new paradigm called social commerce. Social commerce uses the content generated within social networks to attract new consumers and influence their behavior. The objective of this paper is to analyze the role played by social media in increasing trust and intention to use cryptocurrencies in making electronic payments. It develops a model that combines constructs from social support theory, social commerce, and the technology acceptance model. This model is evaluated using the partial least square analysis. The obtained results show that social commerce increases the trust and intention to use cryptocurrencies. However, mutual support among participants does not generate sufficient trust to adequately promote the perceived usefulness of cryptocurrencies. This research provides a practical tool for analyzing how collaborative relationships that emerge in social media can influence or enhance the adoption of a new technology in terms of perceived trust and usefulness. Furthermore, it provides a significant contribution to consumer behavior research by applying the social support theory to the adoption of new information technologies. These theoretical and practical contributions are detailed in the final section of the paper.","[Mendoza-Tello, Julio C.] Cent Univ Ecuador, Sch Comp Engn, Quito 170129, Ecuador; [Mora, Higinio; Pujol-Lopez, Francisco A.] Univ Alicante, Dept Comp Sci Technol & Computat, Alicante 03690, Spain; [Lytras, Miltiadis D.] Amer Coll Greece, Sch Business, Athens 15342, Greece; [Lytras, Miltiadis D.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia","Universidad Central del Ecuador; Universitat d'Alacant; King Abdulaziz University","Mora, H (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Comp Sci Technol & Computat, Alicante 03690, Spain.","hmora@ua.es","Mendoza-Tello, Julio C./ABE-9634-2020; Lytras, Miltiadis/P-8195-2016; Lytras, Miltiadis/ABD-5607-2021; Lytras, Miltiades Demetrios/ABD-5355-2021; Mora, Higinio/L-3347-2014","Lytras, Miltiadis/0000-0002-7281-5458; Mora, Higinio/0000-0002-8591-0710; Mendoza-Tello, Julio Cesar/0000-0003-1895-0453","Spanish Research Agency (AEI); European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) through project CloudDriver4Industry [TIN2017-89266-R]","Spanish Research Agency (AEI); European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) through project CloudDriver4Industry","This work was supported in part by the Spanish Research Agency (AEI) and in part by the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) through project CloudDriver4Industry under Grant TIN2017-89266-R.","","75","45","45","3","20","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536","","","IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access","","2018","6","","","","","","50737","50751","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2869359","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2869359","","","15","Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","GW5ZL","","Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-12-04","WOS:000447022100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Estimating the main parameters of the model, the theoretical predictions for the power-law exponents of coin and token distributions are in remarkable agreement with the empirical estimations, given the simplicity of the model. Our results clearly characterize coins as being 'entrenched incumbents' and tokens as an 'explosive immature ecosystem', largely due to massive and exuberant Initial Coin Offering activity in the token space. The theory predicts that the exponent for tokens should converge to 1 in the future, reflecting a more reasonable rate of new entrants associated with genuine technological innovations.","[Wu, Ke; Wheatley, Spencer; Sornetteu, Didier] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Entrepreneurial Risks, Scheuchzerstr 7, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sornetteu, Didier] Univ Geneva, Swiss Finance Inst, Geneva, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Geneva","Wu, K (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Entrepreneurial Risks, Scheuchzerstr 7, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.","kwu@student.ethz.ch","Wu, Ke/M-8163-2019","Wu, Ke/0000-0002-8118-8011","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [643073]","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant","This work has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement no. 643073.","","47","18","19","1","18","ROYAL SOC","LONDON","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","2054-5703","","","ROY SOC OPEN SCI","R.

Blockchains may be capable of engendering a new type of economic system: the blockchain economy. In the blockchain economy, agreed-upon transactions would be enforced autonomously, following rules defined by smart contracts. The blockchain economy would manifest itself in a new form of organizational design-decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)-which are organizations with governance rules specified in the blockchain. We discuss the blockchain economy along dimensions defined in the IT governance literature: decision rights, accountability, and incentives. Our case study of a DAO illustrates that governance in the blockchain economy may depart radically from established notions of governance. Using the three governance dimensions, we propose a novel IT governance framework and a research agenda for governance in the blockchain economy. We challenge common assumptions in the blockchain discourse, and propose promising information systems research related to these assumptions.","[Beck, Roman; Muller-Bloch, Christoph] IT Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; [King, John Leslie] Univ Michigan, Sch Informat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","IT University Copenhagen; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan","Beck, R (corresponding author), IT Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.","beck@itu.dk; chmy@itu.dk; jlking@umich.edu","Beck, Roman/AAL-7820-2020","Beck, Roman/0000-0002-6341-2382; Mueller-Bloch, Christoph/0000-0002-3738-2167","","","","","49","152","156","30","201","ASSOC INFORMATION SYSTEMS","ATLANTA","GEORGIA STATE UNIV, 35 BROAD STREET, STE 916-917, ATLANTA, GA 30303 USA","1536-9323","1558-3457","","J ASSOC INF SYST","J.

In our work, we scrutinize the long-range dependence structure of volatility in a plethora of alternative and common investments via the use of a fractionally integrated conditional heteroscedastic model. Particularly, we evaluate the fractional persistence parameter of the temporal dynamics for the volatility series of Islamic, socially responsible and common investment indices related to the world major international stock markets. Long-range memory in volatility is measured under different types of market randomness, namely distributional specifications wherein the stochastic error components follow Normal and non-Normal densities. Our empirical results show strong evidence of long-range dependence in the volatility of alternative and common investments under all stochasticity assumptions. Furthermore, we show that the randomness profile has no effect upon the variability of long-range memory. We indicate differences in the statistical significance of the long-range memory across the investigated markets as well as in the degree of persistence.

Among the eight cryptocurrencies under study, we find that all single cryptocurrencies besides one as well as a combination thereof yield significant diversification benefits when being added to a well-diversified benchmark portfolio. However, the improvement solely stems from an increase in portfolio returns, not a reduction of risk. Along with that distinction, we find that the overall beneficial impact of cryptocurrencies only holds for bullish market phases throughout our observation period, but vanishes completely throughout the price collapse of cryptocurrencies in 2018. Furthermore, we model daily differences in the returns and volatility of cryptocurrencies with an EGARCH model. Throughout the observation period considered, returns of all eight cryptocurrencies on Sundays are significantly lower than those on other days. A similar but less distinctive pattern is also observable for their conditional variance. One possible reason for the negative Sunday effect is the lower trading volume observed on Sundays, in connection with the assumption of a causal relationship between trading volume and asset returns and volatility as suggested by the mixture of distributions hypothesis.","[Dorfleitner, Gregor] Univ Regensburg, Finance, Regensburg, Germany; [Lung, Carina] Univ Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany","University of Regensburg; University of Regensburg","Dorfleitner, G (corresponding author), Univ Regensburg, Finance, Regensburg, Germany.","gregor.dorfleitner@ur.de","","","","","","","79","16","16","2","8","PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD","BASINGSTOKE","BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND","1470-8272","1479-179X","","J ASSET MANAG","J.

To achieve different functions of ABE, IBE and IBS in one cryptosystem, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive, called combined attribute-based/identity-based encryption and signature (C-AB/IB-ES).

Analysing these records shows that (i) current research on FinTech is fragmented with limited theoretical grounding; (ii) crowdfunding and blockchain can be regarded as two innovations that may disrupt traditional financial intermediation but in different ways; (iii) crowdfunding platforms substitute for traditional financial intermediaries and serve as a new intermediary, without eliminating the need for intermediation; (iv) similar to crowdfunding, blockchain also creates new intermediaries; and (v) the trust element inherent in blockchain enables blockchain to eliminate the need for intermediaries in some financial areas but not all.","[Cai, Cynthia Weiyi] Charles Sturt Univ, Melbourne Study Grp Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Charles Sturt University","Cai, CW (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Melbourne Study Grp Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.","cynthia.pvic@gmail.com","Cai, Cynthia Weiyi/K-4944-2019","Cai, Cynthia Weiyi/0000-0002-4216-843X","","","","","59","85","85","25","148","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0810-5391","1467-629X","","ACCOUNT FINANC","Account .
